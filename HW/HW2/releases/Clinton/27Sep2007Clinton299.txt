September 27  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on President to Sign Children s Health Insurance Bill into Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Praises Senate Passage of Hate Crimes Bill            Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today spoke on the floor of the Senate  urging the President to sign into law the Childrens Health Insurance bill the Senate is expected to approve today The bill also includes the Support for Injured Servicemembers Act of 2007  legislation Senator Clinton introduced along with Senator Dodd to provide up to six months of job protected leave for spouses  children  parents or next of kin of service members who suffer from a combat related injury or illness  enacting a key recommendation of the Dole Shalala Commission on Care for America s Returning Wounded Warriors In her remarks  Senator Clinton also praised passage today by the Senate of the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act    The following is a transcript of Senator Clinton s remarks   Senator Clinton  Mr  President  today in this chamber we are considering three critical issues that go to the heart of values that we have as a nation   three pieces of legislation that seek to honor these values by putting them into action    We have passed    and I am proud to support    a bill to strengthen our capacity to stop hate crimes by supporting local law enforcement  We will be passing the largest expansion of health care for children since we created the Children s Health Insurance Program during the Clinton Administration  And finally  included in this Children s Health Insurance Program legislation  is a provision that I sponsored and authored with Senator Dodd to support injured servicemembers by giving their families more time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act    This is a banner day for the Senate and the Congress  and I am proud to join a bipartisan coalition in tackling these challenges  from children without health insurance to military families without the support they need    Now  Mr  President  we will pass the CHIP legislation by a wide margin  And so the choice will then fall squarely on the shoulders of the president  Will he join us in helping injured servicemembers and in providing health care to 3 8 million children who right now don t have it  Or will he put ideology ahead of military families and vulnerable children  We  in this chamber  know what the right choice is  The American people also know what the right choice is    Senator Clinton  I hope that our president will put progress over partisanship and join the bipartisan majority and the vast majority of Americans in believing we can no longer treat these challenges and the people who face them as though they were invisible    I believe every child deserves health care  yet far too many children in our nation    more thannine million    do not have access to quality  affordable health care  That s a moral crisis  and it should be impelling us to act  and this Congress has done so    A few weeks ago  I met Amy McCutchin  who was struggling to find health insurance for her two year old daughter  Pascale    a healthy  lively  two and a half year old  Amy works as a contractor while also going to school for her Master s degree  She s divorced  She lost her insurance because of the divorce  She s not offered insurance through her employer because she does freelance work  Unfortunately  Pascale and her mom are among the millions for whom the Children s Health Insurance Program is currently unavailable    When I met Amy  she stressed  she s trying to do the right thing  She works hard  She s what we would call barely middle class  In fact  she can t miss a day of work or she doesn t get paid  but she s also going to school full time  and she has to balance that with her work and the care of her daughter  She s falling through the cracks and so is little Pascale  Its a story that s being told nine million times every day by the parents of the children without health insurance    Senator Clinton  Today  we can tell a different story and create a different outcome  I was proud to help create the State Children s Health Insurance Program during the Clinton Administration  I worked on that legislation during my time as First Lady  In fact  after the bill was passed into law    a bipartisan majority in this Congress making that happen    I helped to get the word out to tell parents that help was on the way and to sign up children for the program in the first few years  In the Senate  I ve continued that effort  fighting to ensure that health care for children has the priority in our budget that it deserves  And I m proud of the progress we ve made    The CHIP program provides health insurance forsix million children  In New York alone  almost 400 000 kids benefit from CHIP every month  And with that strong bipartisan  bicameral agreement  hammered out in this chamber byChairman Baucus and Senators Grassley  Rockefeller  and Hatch  an additional 72 000 children in New York will have access to health care coverage  It will also help enroll many of the almost 300 000 children in New York who live in families that are already eligible for CHIP or for Medicaid  because they make less than  52 000 a year    250 percent of the poverty level for a family of four  Now  it sounds like a lot of money  I know  to some people around the country  It doesn t go very far in New York  and it s one of the reasons why so many children in New York don t have access to health care and why we re fighting so hard in New York to extend health care to those who need it and can t yet afford it    According to the Congressional Budget Office  3 8 million children who are uninsured nationwide will gain coverage  That will reduce the number of uninsured children by one third over the next five years   Now  Mr  President  if we can afford tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and tax cuts for oil companies making record profits  I think we ought to be able to find it in our hearts and in our budget to cover the millions of children who deserve a healthy start  I want to be very clear  if the president vetoes this bill    as he has threatened    he will be vetoing health care for almost 4 million children  and he will be putting ideology  not children  first    Senator Clinton  Earlier this year  I was proud to introduce legislation with Chairman John Dingell from the House of Representatives to reauthorize and expand CHIP  and I m very pleased that a number of the ideas in our bill are included in this legislation  such as cutting red tape and bolstering incentives to get eligible children into the program    The legislation also improves access to private coverage and expands access to benefits like mental health and dental coverage  Some of you have heard me tell the story about the young boy living in Maryland whose mother wasn t on Medicaid  wasn t on CHIP  was struggling to get some kind of health care coverage for her children when her 12 year old son came down with a toothache  And Medicaid and CHIP don t cover dental care in many cases anyway  So  even though she got onto coverage  she couldn t find a dentist who was available to actually provide the dental care  Her son continued to complain  The toothache turned into an abscess  the abscess broke  Next thing you know  the little boy is in the emergency room and being admitted to the hospital  But because the poison had already spread into his bloodstream  he had to be put on life support and Deamonte didn t make it  So for the lack of a visit to a dentist    might have cost  80 to  85    a little boy lost his life  So expanding access to mental health and dental coverage is absolutely critical    I also want to commend the authors of this bipartisan agreement for their work and for bringing forward a practical  fiscally responsible compromise  It represents the culmination of a lot of hard work  and I see some of the staff from the Finance Committee here on the floor  and I thank them because I know how much they did to make this possible    I m also pleased that the conference report includes the Support For Injured Servicemembers Act of 2007  legislation that Senator Dodd and I introduced to provide up to six months of job protected leave for spouses  children  and parents of servicemembers who suffer from combat related disease or illness  This amendment implements a key recommendation of the Dole Shalala Commission  chaired by former Senator Dole who served with great distinction in this chamber and Secretary Shalala  who served for eight years under the Clinton Administration as the Secretary of Health and Human Services  Their Commission on Care for America s Returning Wounded Warriors came up with a number of recommendations  and those recommendations are supported by a broad bipartisan coalition in Congress    Senator Clinton  You know  the families of our servicemen and women face extraordinary demands in caring for loved ones who are injured while serving our nation  Currently  these spouses  parents  and children receive only the 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act    But as the Dole Shalala Commission found  all too often  this is just not enough time  An injured servicemember usually grapples with not only physical injuries  but having been just a few weeks or months before a healthy  fit  young person and now with the loss of a limb or being blinded or burned  having to come to grips with all of that  That takes time  as well as medical care  And these new injuries that our servicemembers are suffering  the traumatic brain injuries that we re only now focusing on  are especially difficult    You know  I remember being at Walter Reed a few months ago  and I met a young army captain who had been in a convoy hit by one of those Improvised Explosive Devices  resulting in the loss of his right arm and the loss of the ring finger on his left arm because he had his wedding band on his finger and the explosion had caused his wedding band to melt into his finger  unfortunately  causing him to lose that finger  I asked him  Captain  how are you doing  He said  Oh  Senator  I m making progress  You know  the folks are helping me get used to the prosthetic and Im learning how to use it he said  but where do I go to get my brain back  He said  You know  I never had to ask people for help before  Now my wife has to make a list for me every morning  telling me where I have to go to meet my appointments and what I have to do when I m there  He said  Where do I go to get my brain back   Well  these wounds    some that you can see  some that you can t    are extremely serious and require family members to be available  The language included in the bill expands leave to six months  Its a step that we can take immediately that will make a real difference in the lives of these wounded warriors and their families  and I hope that the president will think about that before he vetoes this bill    Now  I am disappointed that the CHIP bill doesn t include the Legal Immigrant Children s Health Improvement Act  which I introduced with Senator Snowe and have been working on with her for a number of years  This bipartisan bill would give states the flexibility to provide Medicaid and CHIP coverage to low income  legal immigrant children and pregnant women  I want to underscore that  We re talking about legal immigrant children and pregnant women    Senator Clinton  The current restrictions prevent thousands of legal immigrant children and pregnant women from receiving preventive health services and treatment for minor illnesses before they become serious  Families who are unable to access care for their children have little choice but to turn to emergency rooms  This hurts children  plain and simple  and I think it costs us money  You know  a legal pregnant woman who can t get prenatal care  may have a premature baby who ends up in a natal intensive care unit  which ends up costing us hundreds of thousands of dollars  So I hope that we re going to be able to lift this ban and make it possible for states to access Medicaid and CHIP for legal immigrant children and pregnant women    But  Mr  President  I could not be prouder that the Senate is voting on expanding health care to 3 8 million children  There is no debating the importance of this and the way that the Senate has come together in order to produce this result    Finally  I am proud to support the bipartisan legislation which we have passed to strengthen our tools against crimes motivated by hate on the basis of a victim s race  ethnic background  religion  gender  sexual orientation  disability  and gender identity  These are crimes not just against an individual but against a community  And what we have done by moving this legislation forward means that we are taking a stand on behalf of those individuals and communities affected  Hate crimes are an affront to the core values that bind us one to the other in our country  and we should dedicate the resources needed to prosecute these crimes to the fullest extent of the law    I m very proud of our country and I think we rightly hold ourselves up as a model for the ideals of equality  tolerance  and mutual understanding  But we cannot rest  We have to continue to fight hate motivated violence in America  And with today s vote  the Senate is proclaiming loudly that the American people will not tolerate crimes motivated by bigotry and hatred  that we will punish such crimes and the bigotry they represent    Senator Clinton  I would like to commend Judy and Dennis Shepard for their extraordinary dedication and leadership when it comes to the prosecution of hate crimes  The murder of their son Matthew was a tragic event for a family  but a motivating cause was created  No parent should ever have to bear what the Shepards have borne but their grace and their grit in going forward is inspirational    The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a step toward honoring their son s memory and everyone who s ever been afflicted by hate motivated violence and harassment  And I want to commend my colleague  Senator Kennedy  for his longtime leadership on this important matter The Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act condemns the abhorrent practice of victimizing people and authorizes the Justice Department to help state and local governments investigate and prosecute these appalling offenses and I would to commend my colleague and friend  Senator Hatch    So today is a good day for the United States Senate  Mr  President  We re doing good work  and it may be at a glacial pace in some of our eyes  but I have faith in our system and I have the utmost respect for this body  And it s an honor to be part of it and to especially on a day like today  when we make progress on behalf of the values that America stands for  Thank you very much  and I yield the floor          Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning children s health insurance
