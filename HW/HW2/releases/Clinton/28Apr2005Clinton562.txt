April 28  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Filibusters and the Nuclear Option                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This morning  I joined my Democratic colleagues in front of one of our great national monuments  the Jefferson Memorial  to sound an alarm  To reach out  not just to our colleagues in the Congress  but to people across the country  It doesn t matter whether you re a Republican or a Democrat  an independent  or  frankly  you don t care about politics  You re an American  you re an American citizen  and you have all of the benefits and privileges that our Constitution gives you  And one of the greatest gifts the Constitution provides is the certain knowledge that the United States Senate stands as a check against majority power  that it provides a balance to make sure the minority has a voice        When people come to Washington  visit our great monuments  read the words chiseled on their sides  they are reminded of how this extraordinary country came into being  There s never been a country like this before    and there is still nothing like it today  And it s all because we have this extraordinary system of checks and balances under our constitutional form of government           We have accountability  It doesn t matter who you are  how high and mighty you might be  We have a system that holds people to elections and that creates a government that really does check the abuse of power  We do have majority rule  but we also guarantee and protect minority rights          Having been on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue when my husband was President  I know that sometimes you get a little frustrated when you re in the White House  You say to yourself   why can t the Senate just do what I want them to do   Well  it s because the White House and Congress are two separate and independent branches of government  And the Senate must do what the individual Senators representing their constituencies and their consciences believe is best for their states and our country           We have been confirming hundreds of the judges that the President has sent to us  We confirmed the 206th judge yesterday  We have stopped 10  far  far fewer than the number of nominees stopped by the Senate Republicans when my husband was President  He sent more than 60 judicial nominees who were never even given a vote in committee  My husband didn t say  let s change the Constitution  let s throw away the rules we don t like   That is what you have to deal with when you re the President working with an independent Senate  Unfortunately  this President and his allies seem to believe that they have the right to decide how our country will be governed without any check or without any balance  We think that is not only wrong  but very damaging to our system of government          We ve done pretty well for more than 215 years  We ve survived a civil war  World Wars  the Depression  cold wars  and so many other challenges  And this system of government of ours has worked  It is the envy of the rest of the world  We do not need to begin to go down the slippery slope of moving towards absolute power consolidated in one person  namely the President  That is not the way that America has ever operated  and that is not what we need to be doing today           I must admit that I find it somewhat ironic that as we fight to promote democracy abroad  we are watching the fundamental tenets of our democracy here at home be torn apart by a Republican majority that is only interested in promoting its own extremist agenda  We are speaking to leaders in Iraq and Afghanistan and encouraging them to take a good look at our system which combines democratic rule with a fundamental respect for minority views and minority rights  And yet  the Senate Republican leadership is looking to do the opposite by silencing the minority  The hypocrisy is obvious          So we are asking our Republican colleagues to think hard  to be people of conscience  to stand up for their beliefs and to tell their President  just as President Jefferson and President Franklin Roosevelt were told by people of their own party when they tried to aggrandize executive power   you know  I m with you 99  of the time  but this is a bridge too far   This action would result in the unraveling of our constitutional democracy
