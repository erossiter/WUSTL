June 30  2005 Statement of Senator Clinton for the Congressional Record on Central American Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr  President      Today the Senate votes on the Central American Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement  During my tenure as Senator  I have voted for every trade agreement that has come before the Senate and I believe that properly negotiated trade agreements can increase living standards and foster openness and economic development for all parties  When DR CAFTA negotiations began  I was eager to support an agreement  It was my sincere hope that President Bush would send an agreement to Congress that would help address the DR CAFTA nations   development challenges and spread the gains from trade more broadly  Unfortunately  the Bush Administration has not submitted such an agreement  instead missing a tremendous opportunity to conclude an agreement that strengthens the bonds between the United States and the DR CAFTA nations  While this agreement provides some benefit for New York  I regretfully conclude the harm outweighs the good  I must therefore vote to oppose      My vote to oppose DR CAFTA is one taken with great difficulty  I have heard strong arguments both for and against from many New Yorkers who have a stake in the agreement and I have weighed them seriously  Segments of the New York economy would benefit from this agreement  But at the end of the day  I cannot support an agreement that fails to include adequate labor standards and is a step backward in the development of bipartisan support for international trade      At the outset  it is important to understand that consideration of DR CAFTA is not occurring in isolation  This agreement must be read within the larger context of the failed economic and trade policies of this Administration  Under this Administration  the trade deficit has soared  The offshoring of U S  jobs has continued to increase  and the U S  economy has experienced a net loss of U S  jobs  The Administration has no plans to address rising health care and pension costs that are imposing such a tremendous burden on American businesses  This Administration has also failed to enforce existing trade rules and has not been aggressive in addressing the tax and capital subsidies of our competitors      Turning to the specifics of the agreement itself  DR CAFTA fails in significant respects  The most problematic elements are its labor provisions which retreat from advances made in the late 1990s and that culminated in the labor provisions of the U S  Jordan Free Trade Agreement  The U S  Jordan Free Trade agreement included internationally recognized enforceable labor standards in the text of the agreement  Sadly  DR CAFTA is a step backward  The labor provisions of the DR CAFTA agreement instead used an   enforce your own laws    standard which is not included in any other area of the agreement  An   enforce your own laws    standard may work in nations with a strong tradition of labor enforcement  but the International Labor Organization  ILO  has documented that the CAFTA countries   labor laws have not complied with international norms in at least 20 areas      The Jordan FTA made labor rights obligations subject to the same dispute settlement resolution procedure as commercial obligations  Conversely  DR CAFTA includes a separate dispute settlement procedure for labor disagreements which caps the damages that can be imposed for labor violations      The Chile  Australia and Singapore free trade agreements  which I supported  contained similar   enforce your own law    labor provisions to DR CAFTA  but as I noted when I voted for these agreements  I was greatly disturbed by these provisions   departure from the labor rights standards negotiated in the U S  Jordan Free Trade Agreement  In the end  I supported these agreements despite these concerns because I believed the agreements would not harm the average working person in those nations and  thus  the flawed labor provisions did not outweigh the benefits offered by the agreements  I noted  however  that I would not continue to support agreements with these provisions where the impact was greater on workers  In the DR CAFTA agreement  the flawed labor provisions represent a real missed opportunity to spread the benefits of trade not just to the wealthy elites  but to the broader workforce as well       There are other problems with the DR CAFTA agreement  The final agreement excludes provisions for assisting U S  workers harmed by trade  The environmental provisions of CAFTA undermine environmental protection  by including a lack of parity between the enforcement of commercial and environmental provisions  This is a clear step back from the Jordan Free Trade Agreement  Finally  the environmental conservation provisions lack a commitment to fund their implementation      The agreement also fails in the area of public health  Regarding pharmaceuticals  I would note that in 2001  142 countries  including the United States  adopted the   Doha Declaration     an agreement that provided that trade obligations should be interpreted and implemented in ways that protect public health  In August 2002  Congress passed the Trade Promotion Authority Act which applied Doha to U S  trade negotiations  Despite this commitment  the Administration has promoted provisions within trade agreements    including DR CAFTA   that will significantly impede the ability of developing countries to obtain access to inexpensive  life saving medications  Contrary to the principles of Doha  these agreements place the interests of large multinational drug companies over the ability of developing countries to safeguard public health      The DR CAFTA agreement negotiated by the President represents a missed opportunity in many respects  both for the DR CAFTA nations and for the U S  For the DR CAFTA nations  it is a missed opportunity to insure that the benefits of trade flow to all of their citizens and not just wealthy elites  This agreement will not promote democracy and stability in these nations  A stronger agreement would instead have bolstered the political and economic stability in these nations  through fair apportionment of benefits  In some of the DR CAFTA nations  the agreement has proved to be quite polarizing and a better agreement could have gained broader public support       For the U S   DR CAFTA was a missed opportunity to reconstitute the bipartisan consensus in support of international trade  Rather than consult widely and develop a consensus  the Administration has decided to go for a narrow victory with disturbing implications for the possibility of bipartisan trade agreements in the future  In a time when Americans are facing increasing economic anxiety  trade is often viewed with suspicion  An Administration which fails to consult and pushes for trade agreements which are unable to get bipartisan support undermines public support for international trade as a tool for economic development and greater prosperity  Even if the Administration is successful in gaining passage of DR CAFTA  I fear that this victory will be hollow as the anxiety over international trade continues to grow  In the end  the Administration  s strategy to ignore consultation and consensus in its trade policy may do more harm for the cause of international trade than the purported benefits of this agreement       While it is inevitable that some will benefit more than others from open markets  we have a responsibility to ensure that the basic rules of the game are fair  In previous trade agreements  this balance was achieved  And I voted for those agreements  DR CAFTA fails this test       This is a sad day for supporters of free and fair rules based trade  Our relationship with our Central American neighbors is a critical one  The right CAFTA deal would strengthen ties between the U S  and these nations  I urge the Administration to reopen the CAFTA negotiations and re establish the broad  bipartisan coalition for trade
