                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Call on Hungarian Government to cooperate fully with United States Holocaust Museum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   Senator Clinton has joined her colleagues on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe    The Helsinki Commission      calling on Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcs    ny to ensure the full cooperation of his government with the United States Holocaust Museum           In a letter to Prime Minister Gyurcs    ny  Senator Clinton and other members of the Commission expressed their concerns that intelligence agencies coordinated by the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministries of Justice and Defense are not abiding by critical aspects of the Hungarian Government  s commitment to the Museum because they have failed to provide copies of reports on missing archival records  including reports from four key security agencies  The archival collections at issue address some of the most important Holocaust issues in Hungary  including subjects ranging from forced labor to deportations  from property expropriation to the documentation of massacres          In their letter  Senator Clinton and the other Commissioners pointed out that obtaining reports from these agencies is critical  as they will most likely provide important new insights regarding the missing documents             It is crucial that the United States Holocaust Museum has the full cooperation of all European Governments in order to carry on its immensely important work     Senator Clinton said    The Prime Minister of Hungary must make all resources available to the museum             In April 2005  Senator Clinton and the other members of the Helsinki Commission wrote to Prime Minister Gyurcsany regarding difficulties encountered by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in its archival work in Hungary  They urged the Hungarian government to grant Museum researchers access to all Holocaust related archival materials and were pleased to learn of improved access  Unfortunately  given the intelligence agencies   failure to cooperate  Senator Clinton and the Commissioners are once again urging the Prime Minister to personally intervene to guarantee that the Hungarian Government is fully cooperative with the United States Holocaust Museum        A copy of the letter from the Helsinki Commission to Prime Minister Gyurcs    ny is attached       COMMISSION ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE  234 FORD HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING  WASHINGTON  DC 20515 6460  FAX   202  226 4199  www csce gov      September 28  2006      His Excellency Ferenc Gyurcs    ny  Primes Minister of the Republic of Hungary  Budapest  Hungary      Dear Prime Minister Gyurcs    ny       In April 2005  members of the Helsinki commission wrote to you regarding difficulties encountered by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in its archival work in Hungary  We urged your government to grant Museum researchers access to all Holocaust related archival materials and were pleased to learn of improved access  Unfortunately  we have recently learned that intelligence agencies coordinated by the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministries of Justice and Defense have failed to cooperate with critical aspects of the Hungarian Government  s commitment to cooperate with the Museum  We urge you to intervene and ensure that these issues are quickly resolved          Our principal point of concern is the failure of your government to provide the Museum with copies of reports on missing archival records  including reports from four key security agencies  Obtaining reports from these agencies is critical  as they will most likely provide important new insights regarding the missing documents  The archival collections at issue address some of the most important Holocaust issues in Hungary  including subjects ranging from forced labor to deportations  from property expropriation to the documentation of massacres  While we appreciate the establishment by your office of a Working Group with the Museum  the credibility of that group will be severely undermined if documents are withheld           We wish to recall that in the Document of the 1991 Cracow Symposium on cultural Heritage  all OSCE participating States  including Hungary  agreed to   strive to preserve and protect those monuments and sites of remembrance  including most notable extermination camps  and the related archives  which are themselves testimonials to tragic experiences in their common past  Such steps need to be taken in order that those experiences may be remembered  may help to teach present and future generations of these events  and thus ensure that they are never repeated  emphasis added               Access to non public archival records is critical if we are to more fully and accurately remember the tragic lessons of the Holocaust  Accordingly  we respectful ask that archivists of relevant ministries and agencies be instructed to share with the Working Group information relating to the missing Holocaust records          Sincerely       Sam Brownback  U S S    Chairman    Christopher H  Smith  M C   Co Chairman    Hillary Rodham Clinton  U S S   Commissioner    Frank R  Wolf  M C
