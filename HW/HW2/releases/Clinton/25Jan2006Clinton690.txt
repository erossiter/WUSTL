January 25  2006 Senators Clinton  Reid Introduce Legislation to Promote Greater Energy Independence and Economic Competitiveness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Legislation Would Fund Innovative Energy Research and Development Projects                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Democratic Leader Harry Reid  NV  introduced legislation today to improve American energy independence and economic competitiveness through groundbreaking research and development  a key component of the Senate Democratic   Energy Independence 2020    campaign           The Clinton Reid   Advanced Research Projects Energy Act  ARPA E Act     would create a new agency within the U S  Department of Energy  DOE  modeled after the Department of Defense  s successful Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  or DARPA   Through this new agency  the DOE would support a portfolio of high risk  high pay off research to speed the process of moving cutting edge energy technologies into the marketplace             Senator Clinton also joined Senators Domenici  Bingaman  Alexander and Mikulski in introducing two bills     Protect America  s Competitive Edge through Energy    and   Protect America  s Competitive Edge Through Tax Incentives                 All three pieces of legislation implement recommendations contained in a report issued by the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  in October 2005   That report  Rising Above the Gathering Storm  Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future     was conducted by a committee that that included Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute President Shirley Ann Jackson  Nobel Laureate Robert C  Richardson of Cornell University  and other representatives of academia and industry   The NAS report concluded that U S  preeminence in science and technology are in decline  putting U S  economic competitiveness at risk   The report recommended a set of urgent actions to bolster science education  basic scientific research  and energy research to counter this trend               Greater energy independence and increased economic competitiveness ought to be among our top national priorities  but we are not committing the federal research and development dollars we need to get the job done   My legislation will provide the resources to harness American innovation to tackle some of our most pressing energy challenges     said Senator Clinton     My legislation will fund out of the box research and development projects focused on reducing our oil consumption  increasing energy efficiency  and reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing global warming               We should immediately undertake an Apollo like R program to rapidly transform our country s energy use to address critical national security  environmental and affordability concerns   This ARPA E initiative is a crucial component of the Democrats  Energy Independence 2020 effort to get us off of foreign oil and other expensive fuels  and to develop cheaper  safer alternatives as quickly as possible     said Leader Reid             In its report  the National Academy of Sciences concluded that current federal and corporate energy research and development programs contain gaps that could be filled by a new agency    In particular  ARPA E could invest in a broad portfolio of foundational research that is needed to invent transforming technologies that used to be supplied by our great industrial laboratories of the past              The ARPA E Act responds to these challenges and the NAS recommendations by creating ARPA E and authorizing a total of  9 billion of funding for fiscal years 2007 20011   The mission of the agency is to implement an innovative energy research  technology development and deployment program to sponsor a diverse portfolio of projects that will                  Increase national security by significantly reducing petroleum and imported fuels consumption             Significantly improve the efficiency of electricity use and the reliability of the electricity system  and            Significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions             The PACE Energy Act would double authorized funding for the Department of Energy  s Office Science  which runs Brookhaven National Laboratory               The funding shortfall at Brookhaven this year is a keen reminder Congress is not adequately funding basic scientific research     said Senator Clinton     This bipartisan legislation would double authorized funding for DOE  s Office of Science so that we can use Brookhaven and the other great national laboratories to their full potential             The PACE Energy Act would also authorize the Secretary of the Department of Energy to fund new science education programs in association with Brookhaven National Laboratory  including a summer internship program for middle and high school students to promote hands on learning in math and science  and a   Center of Excellence in Mathematics and Science Education    at a public secondary school located near Brookhaven             Other highlights of the PACE Energy and PACE Tax bills include                New incentives to help states establish or expand public  statewide math and science specialty schools             New DOE merit based scholarships of up to  20 000 per year four up to four years for undergraduate students pursuing a baccalaureate degree in mathematics  science  or engineering at a 4 year college             A New DOE Graduate Research Fellowship Program to provide tuition and financial support for Master  s and Doctoral students in mathematics  science  or engineering             Doubles the current Research and Development Tax Credit  and makes it permanent
