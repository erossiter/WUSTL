January 26  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Palestinian Elections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Hamas  s terrorist campaigns have claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians  and its leaders refuse to disarm  reject violence or recognize the right of the State of Israel to exist   Until and unless Hamas renounces violence and terror  and abandons its position calling for the destruction of Israel  I don t believe the United States should recognize Hamas  nor should any nation in the world
