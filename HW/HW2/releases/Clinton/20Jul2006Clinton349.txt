world class tourist attraction  The expansion of the Hall of Fame will be a significant step in the future of this important project  The timing of this funding is exciting especially given the recent announcement of plans to rehabilitate the Seneca Knitting Mill as the Hall of Fame  s home for the 21st century     Senator Clinton said     This is a vision that many in the local community have had for some time and I am thrilled to have been able to secure this funding to help take it from a dream to a reality             The Seneca Knitting Mill is an 1844 structure built to house wool milling and production activities   It was in continuous operation for over 150 years and was a foundation institution in the industrial  economic  and socio cultural heritage of the historic village of Seneca Falls  NY  Its founding generation were reformers  many associated with the anti slavery Free Soil Party  active in abolition and then women  s rights causes   The Mill  s history was central to the region  s economy and particularly the history of immigration to the area   The Mill was in danger of deterioration and the Seneca Knit Development Corporation was formed in 2001 to save and preserve this historically significant structure          The National Women  s Hall of Fame  founded in 1969 in Seneca Falls  NY  to honor outstanding American women and their achievements  has among its inductees  more than two dozen women associated with 19th century anti slavery activism  the development of the women  s rights movement  and affiliated reform causes  Harriet Tubman  Elizabeth Cady Stanton  Sojourner Truth  Paulina Wright Davis  Susan B  Anthony  Josephine St  Pierre Ruffin  Ernestine Rose  the Grimke Sisters  Amelia Jenks Bloomer  and many others    Senator Clinton was inducted into the Women s Hall of Fame last year           The Hall outgrew its current location which is an 1870 bank building located in the downtown Historic District  seven years ago  and has been engaged in an intensive site search process since 2002  Demand for Hall programs and services began to grow in the late 1990s and by 2004  the Hall was turning visitors away for lack of space  parking  and other 21st century museum accommodations  In June  2005  the Board resolved to collaborate with the Seneca Knit Development Corporation to work toward rehabilitation of the 36 000 square foot mill complex as the future home of the National Women  s Hall of Fame  The Knitting Mill is an excellent  historically significant vehicle to tell the complex story of the evolution of women  s rights and human rights that arose in the central New York corridor  economic development elements such as increasing Hall visibility and visitation as a major contributor to the local and regional economy  and situational structural aspects such as the provision of adequate space to grow  expand exhibits and services  park buses and individual vehicles  and incorporate climate controlled collections storage  and the site  s energy efficiency features          In September 2005  the Seneca Knit Development Corporation entered into an agreement with the National Women  s Hall of Fame of Seneca Falls  NY  to rehabilitate the Seneca Knitting Mill complex as the future home of the Hall  Last week  the National Women  s Hall of Fame  together with the Seneca Knit Development Corporation  announced the next steps in its campaign to rehabilitate the Seneca Knitting Mill as its home for the 21st century   The National Women  s Hall of Fame and the Seneca Knit Development Corporation have also reached an agreement regarding the transfer of ownership of the western portion of the Seneca Mill site to the Hall of Fame   County and Village subdivision approvals are also in place   Additionally  the National Women  s Hall of Fame announced the selection of Ann Beha Architects to lead their Master Plan  a first step in the development of the new museum in the Mill complex
