July 11  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Secretary Chertoff s Comments about the Increased Risk of a Terrorist Attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   Our nation  and New York in particular  faces serious threats  We need serious analysis  serious homeland security strategies  and serious leadership more concerned with keeping people safe than keeping people afraid  More than five years after 9 11  we still must secure Americas borders  railways  mass transit systems  ports  chemical plants  nuclear facilities  and more  State and local agencies still need real interoperable communications  Our nation still requires risk based  and not politically based  security funding  When I meet with Secretary Chertoff on Thursday  I will share these concerns  And I will tell him personally that I am disappointed in his unhelpful  ambiguous rhetoric  and dismayed by the Bush Administrations failure to match five years of tough talk with an evidence based  strategic response that includes threat based homeland security funding
