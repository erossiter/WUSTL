September 29  2006 Senator Clinton Announces Congress Set to Approve Initiative to Help Service Members Returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and their Families                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Heroes at Home Initiative Will Help Deal with Challenges Like Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Traumatic Brain Injury Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the DoD Authorization conference report finalized today includes major elements of Senator Clinton  s Heroes at Home initiative aimed at enhancing support and services for U S  troops transitioning back home after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan   Senator Clinton  s amendment will assist military service members of Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  with readjustment to work  the problems of posttraumatic stress disorder  PTSD  and other mental health issues  and traumatic brain injury  TBI   The initiative  which is supported by the National Military Family Association and the Wounded Warrior Project  also provides support to their family members  The DoD Appropriations bill included  3 million to provide initial funding for Heroes at Home              With this legislation  the hundreds of thousands of troops who have rotated through Iraq and Afghanistan  including thousands of courageous men and women from New York  will have better access to the support they need as they transition home  Once this bill is signed by the President  it is my hope that the increasing numbers of military service members surviving these conflicts will receive the necessary readjustment support     Senator Clinton said    Many service members face readjustment challenges after war  such as medical  mental health  relationship  and work problems  Family members also are affected by the transition as they struggle to reconnect with their war heroes  some who may be deployed two  three  if not more times              Heroes at Home centers around Department of Defense  DOD  and Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  partnerships with employers and community organizations in acknowledgement of the fact that despite more services and resources being offered at DOD facilities  VA hospitals  and Vet Centers  returning service members are often still reluctant to go to traditional mental health clinics owing to stigma and concerns about confidentiality and their military careers  Only 29  of the approximately 500 000 separated OIF and OEF veterans have sought VA health care services  including mental health services  Last month  a GAO report found that only 22  of OIF and OEF service members who may have been at risk for developing PTSD based on post deployment screenings were referred for further mental health evaluations  In another report from May 2005  the GAO identified that  despite DOD efforts  the needs of demobilizing Reserve and National Guard members for transition assistance were still unmet           Specifically  the Senator  s amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a special working group  partnering representatives from the public and private sectors to identify the needs of returning National Guard and Reserve members in their transition to civilian jobs after deployment  including members who have been injured while serving  and to develop recommendations on ways to improve assistance to them  Also  under the amendment  the existing Department of Defense  DOD  Task Force on Mental Health is charged with assessing mental health conditions  including PTSD  occurring service members  including the National Guard and Reserves  undergoing multiple deployments and with making recommendations for improving mental health services for them           The amendment also calls for a study on the long term physical and mental health consequences and rehabilitation needs of traumatic brain injured service members  To further assist the mushrooming number of traumatic brain injured service members and their families  this amendment also establishes a TBI Family Caregiver Training Curricula for health professionals at DOD and VA hospitals  who would use the curricula to teach family members important skills for caring for their loved ones suffering from TBI when they go home           According to a March 2006 study  19  of Iraq veterans and 11  of Afghanistan veterans reported mental health problems  Among the OIF and OEF veterans seeking care at VA hospitals  nearly a third have been diagnosed with mental disorders  with over 40  of those PTSD  Another report found that 10  to 30  of National Guard members come home from Iraq searching for work  Others return to civilian jobs dissatisfied with old tasks that pale in comparison to wartime responsibilities  In addition to these challenges  a large number of service members are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan with life threatening brain injuries from roadside blasts that can cause brain damage  It is estimated that TBI affects more than 25  of bomb blast survivors    a percentage thought to be higher than in any other past US conflict  making TBI the   signature    injury of Iraq  The diffuse but debilitating symptoms of TBI can leave service members with cognitive and emotional problems  including the inability to adapt to civilian life  However  TBI frequently goes undiagnosed because returning troops may not realize they suffered a concussion or may not show visible signs of injury           Senator Clinton is committed to helping our troops when they return from active duty  She is an original co sponsor of the Healing Invisible Wounds Act that protects PTSD compensation  enhances counseling and readjustment services available to National Guard and Reserve members returning from combat  and authorizes additional funding for Vet Centers  Earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined with the NASD Foundation  members of the armed services and members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to launch a new campaign to deliver financial education tools and training to members of the military and their spouses  She also authored legislation with Senator Susan Collins  R ME  that requires the Department of Defense to provide consumer education for members of the armed forces and their spouses  In addition  the House and Senate have approved legislation she introduced with Senator Mike Enzi  R WY  to protect military personnel against individuals using deceitful practices to sell financial products  This legislation is headed to the President  s desk to be signed into law            To read more about support for the Senator  s legislation  click here  and here         Click here for more of Senator Clinton s statements
