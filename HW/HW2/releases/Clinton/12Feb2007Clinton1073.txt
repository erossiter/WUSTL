                 Calls on Secretary to Include Tenants  Concerns in any Review   Senator Expressed Concern to HUD Secretary Jackson Over the Sale of Starrett City Housing Development Last Week

       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed a commitment by the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  that he will  aggressively  review the  1 3 billion sale of Starrett City but said that any review must include consideration of a number of serious concerns held by tenants and others  Last week Senator Clinton joined her colleague Senator Schumer to call on the HUD Secretary to conduct a thorough assessment of how to maintain the long term affordability of Starrett City before the sale is completed            HUD has a responsibility to approve or disapprove of the transfer of property like this  I am pleased to hear that Secretary Jackson has committed to aggressively review the sale however I hope that the Secretary s review will take our concerns into account   Senator Clinton said   I remain extremely concerned that the outcome of this sale will be increased rents  forcing many people out of their homes         The full text of the Senators  letter is below       February 9  2007      The Honorable Alphonso Jackson  Secretary  United States Department of Housing and Urban Development  451 Seventh Street S W   Washington  D C  20410      Dear Mr  Secretary       Spring Creek Towers  also known as Starrett City  is one of the largest federally subsidized housing developments in the country   With nearly 5 900 units  Starrett City provides affordable housing to over 14 000 seniors and working families            Opened in 1975  Starrett City was created under New York State s Mitchell Lama program and financed with a Section 236 mortgage loan  at one percent interest   In exchange for participating in Section 236  investors were required to make the units available to low  and moderate income households throughout the term of the mortgage   Without question  this important government and private sector partnership has made it possible for thousands of New Yorkers to call Starrett City home              However  the owners of the complex  Starrett City Associates  plan to sell ownership and management of the buildings to the highest bidder   It has come to our attention that the real estate company Clipper Equity holds the highest bid  at  1 3 billion   We believe it is critical that before a sale of the development is completed  the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  must conduct a thorough assessment of how to maintain the long term affordability of Starrett City                 We are concerned that the extremely high sale price will force the new owners to make changes that prove to be onerous to current and future tenants of Starrett City   For example  the new owner could choose to opt out of the Mitchell Lama program or to prepay the Section 236 mortgage  leading to price pressures which  over time  could reduce the overall affordability of the development  These are legitimate concerns  and our offices have heard directly from hundreds of residents who believe this transfer in ownership will result in significantly higher rents  a reduction of services  and undue pressure for tenants to relocate                It is our understanding that HUD has a statutory responsibility to approve or disapprove any transfer of a property that has any type of federal funding or assistance   More specifically  we understand that you are charged with looking at a prospective buyer s portfolio of properties and consider the condition of those properties  the treatment of residents with regard to rent subsidies  claims of harassment  evictions  financial issues with local jurisdictions  among other issues  It is our hope that you will appropriately scrutinize the prospective buyer to ensure that they are capable of managing a development with such extensive federal subsidies                 Given your oversight of the sale and your mission to preserve affordable housing  we are hopeful that HUD will make the approval of this sale contingent upon the new owner s commitment to long term affordability   We urge you to take the necessary steps to ensure that this housing complex remains affordable and continues to be an important part of preserving the middle class for New York City                 We are hopeful your department will act in the best interest of the more than 14 000 residents who are part of this economically and racially diverse success story   We look forward to working with you to honor the history of this important community  as well as our shared belief that all hard working families deserve an affordable place to live          Sincerely yours       Charles E  Schumer                                           Hillary Rodham Clinton
