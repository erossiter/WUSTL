May 25  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Passage of The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006  S 2611                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WASHINGTON  DC    This afternoon I voted in favor of final passage of the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006  legislation intended to strengthen our borders and to provide for an orderly and safe system of immigration that is both strict and fair   While the bill is not perfect  it begins to address the fundamental challenges that confront our current immigration system and implements much needed reforms that both respect our heritage as a nation of immigrants and honor our commitment to the rule of law          In the coming months  Senate and House conferees will attempt to reconcile the two drastically different immigration reform measures passed in each body   I call on members of the conference to engage in negotiations that respect the bipartisan  comprehensive approach adopted by the Senate and reject the narrow  punitive bill passed last December by the House   I also call on the President to exercise his leadership in supporting comprehensive immigration reform   I cannot and will not support one sided solutions that sound tough but neither deal with our porous borders nor treat with respect and dignity the millions of families who live and work in our country
