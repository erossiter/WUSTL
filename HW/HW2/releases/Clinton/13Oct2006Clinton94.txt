October 13  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Buffalo Snow Storm                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I am deeply concerned about the impact of the devastating snow storm that has debilitated the Buffalo area   I have been in touch with Mayor Brown today about the dangerous and difficult conditions in the wake of the storm and will continue to monitor developments closely to make sure we do everything possible to help those affected   We have already seen the strength of the people of Buffalo in the face of this storm  coming together to help each other dig out and regroup   Many will need assistance in the days to come and I have joined with my colleagues in the New York delegation to call on the President and Governor Pataki to make FEMA funding available right away   I have stressed the importance of this aid and will continue to press them so that Buffalo receives the funding it needs   Once that funding is released  I will continue to work with FEMA to make sure that aid goes quickly and efficiently to those who need it   I and my office will be there every step of the way to make sure Buffalo can weather this storm and be back stronger than ever             Senator Clinton today joined with Senator Charles Schumer  Congressman Brian Higgins and Congresswoman Louise Slaughter  writing letters to President Bush and Governor Pataki  urging them to take the necessary steps to provide federal aid to the impacted region            Copies of those letters are below          October 13  2006      The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500 0005      Dear Mr  President        We write in anticipation of a request from Governor Pataki seeking a Major Disaster Area Declaration for Western New York and we urge your quick approval   A major disaster declaration would make the area eligible for federal funding to mitigate the unexpected and un seasonal snow storm that has dropped over 19 inches of snow on Buffalo and the surrounding area   Because this snow is so early in the season  the snowfall  s pressure on trees with leaves still on the branches is causing many to fall resulting in widespread damage to power lines and other infrastructure            The snow has caused excessive damage to infrastructure and private property  cut off power to over 300 000 homes and businesses  closed roadways including 105 miles of the New York State Thruway  and has left area hospitals short on medical staff and patients unable to get care   To recover  residents will need disaster grants and low interest loans to repair their homes and heating systems for the long winter ahead   We also presume that local governments  already stretched by structural financial shortfalls  will need further assistance to restore infrastructure and to assist their citizens   In addition  we ask that you release the remaining emergency Low Income Heating Assistance Program funds to help families in need cope with heating costs          We urge you to approve the declaration request as soon as possible and we look forward to working with you to help the citizens of Western New York recover from this storm          Sincerely                    October 13  2006      The Honorable George E  Pataki  Governor  State Capitol  Albany  NY 12224      Dear Governor Pataki        We write today to pledge our support in securing the maximum federal assistance possible to assist the Greater Buffalo region as it recovers from the record breaking snowstorm of this week   It is our understanding that you have declared four counties in New York to be under a state of disaster  are in the process of completing Preliminary Damage Assessments  PDAs  on the affected area  and will soon formally ask President Bush to declare the region a major disaster area  so that he may immediately activate the federal assistance essential for the response and recovery effort   We want to thank you for your prompt and thorough response to this disaster           As you know  the snowstorm that began yesterday and continued through today dumped between 18 and 24 inches of snow on parts of western New York   At least 350 000 people are without power  and have been told not to expect restored electricity until the middle of next week   The airport has been closed indefinitely  and roads all over the area have been shut down   The National Incident Management Organization has called upon 160 crews from across the country to assist with the shocking number of downed trees  downed wires have caused so many fires that the fire department has been forced to let vacated buildings continue to burn   As the wind speeds pick up  and flurries continue to fall  the damage is only expected to worsen            While the residents and businesses of the Buffalo region are no strangers to snowstorms of great magnitude  it is highly unusual to be hit by such a storm in mid October   Thus  the people and businesses of Buffalo were unprepared for this record breaking storm  and need federal assistance immediately   The Buffalo area simply cannot bear the extra financial burden placed upon it by unexpectedly severe storms          We want you to know that we will fully support you and your office in any way that we can as the affected region recovers   We look forward to working with you to ensure that FEMA will provide these areas with much needed aid   If we may be of any help  please contact          Sincerely
