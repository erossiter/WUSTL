June 15  2006 Senator Clinton Testifies on Behalf of Bethlehem Steel Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Clinton Asks Nuclear Workers Advisory Board to Approve   Special Cohort    Petition Filed by Bethlehem Steel Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today testified before the Presidential Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health at its meeting in Washington  DC   Senator Clinton urged the Board to recommend approval of a special cohort petition recently filed by a group of former Bethlehem Steel workers   Approval of the petition would enable eligible Bethlehem Steel workers to be added to a   special exposure cohort    and receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program without going through case by case radiation dose estimates             Bethlehem Steel nuclear workers and their families have not received the compensation they deserve     said Senator Clinton    I urge the Advisory Board to act swiftly to bring justice and closure to these Cold War heroes              Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 to compensate workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War  Under EEOICPA  former nuclear workers or their survivors were eligible to file claims with the U S  Department of Labor  DOL  for individual payments of  150 000  as well as medical benefits  To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history           Claims are decided by the DOL and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  by using available records about work conditions and employment history  Using these records  NIOSH estimates the radiation doses received by each worker and then determines whether that radiation exposure was likely to have caused the worker  s illness  This   dose reconstruction    process has been time consuming and controversial  particularly at facilities like Bethlehem Steel in Lackawanna  New York  where workers did not wear individual radiation monitors  and there was minimal monitoring of ambient radiation  For Bethlehem Steel workers  compensation decisions have been made using a radiation exposure model that relies on data from another facility  the Simonds Saw facility in Lockport  New York           Anticipating problems with poor records  EEOICPA also provides a process by which groups of workers can petition to be designated as members of a   special exposure cohort     Being added to a cohort means that employees do not have to go through a   dose reconstruction    process  Instead  if a person has an eligible cancer and worked at a facility when weapons work was performed  their cancer is presumed to have been caused by workplace exposure and the person  s claim is paid  Bethlehem Steel workers recently filed such a petition with NIOSH   NIOSH is currently evaluating the petition for completeness   NIOSH will then refer the petition to the Advisory Board  which will vote on whether to recommend approval of the petition to the Secretary of Health and Human Services  who ultimately decides the fate of the petition          Senator Clinton has been a tireless advocate for the Bethlehem Steel nuclear workers   She has been pushing NIOSH and the U S  Department of Health and Human Services to speed up and improve the program   She has introduced legislation to get the Bethlehem Steel workers compensated and she has urged the Administration to approve the special cohort petition for the Bethlehem Steel workers           The following is the transcript of Senator Clinton  s testimony today       Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Behalf of Special Cohort Status for Bethlehem Steel Workers Before the President  s Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health      Thank you very much Dr  Ziemer   And really to the entire board   I really appreciate Dr  Ziemer  Dr  Wade  all of you for the time you  re putting into this really important issue  which to me is a matter of national obligation and I  m grateful to you for taking it so seriously            I  m here today because this body  the President  s Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  has the authority and responsibility to oversee the work the agencies that implement the Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program   One of the board  s specific responsibilities is to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services about whether to approve special exposure cohort petitions that have been referred by NIOSH   While it is not on your agenda this week  you may soon have the responsibility to make such a recommendation on a petition that Bethlehem Steel Workers have submitted to NIOSH            So I come today with a simple message  Bethlehem Steel workers deserve a special exposure cohort and I urge you to recommend one when the petition comes before you            This is one of the most heart rending issues that I  ve worked on in my time in the senate   Like workers at many other sites around New York and our country  Bethlehem Steel employees were essential to our Cold War effort   These people literally built our nuclear arsenal in the decades after World War II and helped us eventually to win the Cold War   In the late   40s and early   50s  the government contracted with Bethlehem Steel  which is in Buffalo  to roll uranium at their plant   But the workers weren  t told what they were working with   They weren  t provided with safety equipment to shield them from radiation   They weren  t monitored to determine how much radiation they were being exposed to   But if you talk to Ed Walker who  s here somewhere  ED  s back there  and to the other workers who I  ve spent time talking to  or to their spouses  or their children of workers who have passed on  you know that this was hot  dirty work  Uranium dust was thick in the air   They breathed it   They coated their hands with it   They would sit on areas in the plant to eat lunch and put their lunch down and the uranium dust would be on their sandwiches   They ingested it   It covered their work clothes            So it  s not surprising that many got them got cancer   And for decades they petitioned their government for help and have been denied   Congress finally did the right think in 2000 with the act that you are part of administering   This was a landmark law and it was such in the tradition of our country to acknowledge the wrong that the government had done  and promise timely compensation to workers and their survivors            We have yet to realize the full promise of that legislation  Since 2001  I have been pushing NIOSH and HHS to speed up and improve the program  Initially I urged NIOSH to make improvements to the Bethlehem Steel site profile and make it better reflect the conditions at Bethlehem Steel            As you know  the original site profile was developed without even a visit to the Bethlehem Steel plant   In the last several years NIOSH has made improvements to the site profile and I thank NIOSH for that   But the more I looked at the situation and the more information that workers and their survivors brought forward to me it became clear that there were great disparities between the site profile and actual conditions at the site   And so I became even more convinced that reconstructing doses for Bethlehem Steel workers is an impossible task   It shouldn  t be surprising   After all  we  re talking about work that occurred in secret 50 years ago and before modern radiation monitoring and safety practices had been developed   As a result  the inability to estimate Bethlehem Steel worker doses is not a failure  it can  t be done   The failure would be if we don  t recognize a special cohort that will give them the recognition  the justice that they deserve            When Congress passed the law in 2000  it recognized that reconstructing doses would be impossible in many cases and that  s why the special cohort process was included in the law   The statute to my reading is pretty clear   It says that if the government doesn  t have the information to reconstruct doses then workers should be given the benefit of the doubt and their claims should be paid   More precisely it provides for classes of workers to be added to a special exposure cohort if it  s not feasible to estimate the radiation doses with sufficient accuracy  and there is reasonable likelihood that the radiation dose may have endangered their health            I don  t think we could have a clearer case than Bethlehem Steel where not a single worker wore a radiation badge   Where the only radiation measurements we have are a handful of air samples   Where the workers rolled uranium and where many of them contracted radiation related cancers            So I  m appealing to you to help us bring this process to a conclusion   It has been six years since Congress passed the law   I have had meetings with these survivors and with the workers themselves  but there are not many workers left   I think they deserve to be compensated and really given justice for what they did for our country            I understand the site profile is under final revisions  and I just don  t see there  s any way that it can be a fair rendition of what the men in that plant were exposed to   I urge NIOSH to move swiftly to qualify Bethlehem Steel  s petition   I urge this board to forward it to Secretary Leavitt with a favorable recommendation  and I appreciate very greatly the advocacy and the effort you  ve undertaken  because when a document surfaced earlier this year that showed OMB was looking for ways to limit the designation of special exposure cohorts as a cost cutting measure  that was a real slap in the face to these nuclear workers  and it was a slap in the face to Congress as well   I think the law is clear and I  m pleased that it looks as though OMB is backing off of that position   But we don  t want to give them a back door to realize cost cutting at the detriment of the workers who deserve this compensation             So I thank you for your consideration of this   It  s hugely important not just for Bethlehem Steel Workers but for workers and survivors at other sites throughout New York and across our country   We think that justice is long overdue   I  m grateful for what you are doing and I hope that we will be able to continue in the spirit that this legislation was passed  to do what is right by the men and women who did so much for us
