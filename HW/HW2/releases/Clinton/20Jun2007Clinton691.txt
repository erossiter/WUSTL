June 20  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on DHS Announcement on Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   I am glad that the Department of Homeland Security is finally listening to those of us who have been pointing out for years the inherent flaws of this program   However  kicking the can down the road is not a solution   We need a real  workable plan that will ensure our Northern Border is secure while addressing the serious economic concerns of local communities  As I have said before  and will say again  while national security  and in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount  it is crucial that any new travel requirements be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism and the regional economy  Any alternative must be sensible  easily obtainable and affordable and must take into consideration the realities of life along the border  I will continue to press the Department of Homeland Security to listen to communities along the Northern Border  they deserve nothing less
