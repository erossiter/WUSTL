September 7  2007 Clinton  Schumer Blast Federal Rejection of New York s Attempts to Increase Health Coverage for Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chuck Schumer in a statement today expressed their dismay at the Bush administrations denial of New York States application to expand health care access to New York families  New York States planned CHIP expansion would have covered children up to 400 percent of the national poverty level  This expansion would have provided access to an additional 60 000 New York uninsured children  The bipartisan CHIP reauthorization bill that passed the Senate in July would allow New York to implement this proposed expansion    We should build upon the success of the CHIP program and help states like New York  Governor Spitzer has sought to expand access to health care for children in New York by increasing eligibility for the CHIP program  Secretary Leavitt has moved to deny New York States waiver application and prevent New York State from expanding access to CHIP  I will continue to work with Governor Spitzer and my colleagues to see that children are put first in our country  Senator Clinton said  Every child deserves a healthy start in life  thats why this issue transcends the ideological divide  Yet  instead of joining the non partisan chorus  the Bush administration is singing a different tune  This administration looks right through millions of parents who are nervous that their children will get sick and they wont be able to afford costly medical bills    What the President doesnt understand is that even for families well into the middle class  it is very hard to pay for health care  To prevent New York children from being covered is a bad mistake  said Senator Schumer    The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are citing new rules they announced on August 17  2007 as their rationale for denying New York s request   Among the new rules is the requirement that until a state enrolls 95 percent of those eligible for CHIP in households making under 200 percent of the poverty line   41 300 for a family of four   they cannot provide coverage to children in families making above 250 percent of the poverty line   51 625 for a family of four   While all states aspire to cover every eligible child possible  no state has yet reached the 95 percent threshold  In New York  88 percent of such children are enrolled    Senators Clinton and Schumer have been fighting for the expansion of the CHIP program in an effort to cover every child and are strong supporters of legislation before Congress to expand the program
