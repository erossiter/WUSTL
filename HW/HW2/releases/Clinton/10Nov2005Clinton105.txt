November 10  2005 Remarks of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to the American Bar Association  ABA  International Rule of Law Symposium                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Thank you  Karen  I can  t think of a better person to introduce me because after all those much too generous comments it  s only fair to say that Karen herself is a trailblazer for women in the law  And she has given a lot of time over the years very generously to smooth the way for women entering the law here and internationally         I  m pleased that I could be here because as many of you know the Senate is in session  and we had votes and it wasn  t at all apparent until the very end that I could get here and  unfortunately  I  ll have to speak and leave and go back to the Hill  But I want to commend the ABA for convening this International Rule of Law symposium  I want to recognize Michael Greco  the ABA President and other elected heads of the various committees along with the House of Delegates and of course Bill Ide with whom I  ve worked over the years         I also before getting started want publicly to express my condolences and sympathy to the people of Jordan because of the horrible attack which they endured yesterday with loss of life and casualties  Our thoughts and prayers are with them  particularly with those who perished  and their loved ones  It  s a further brutal reminder of the importance of the rule of law and the necessity of our efforts to spread the rule of law and help to embed it in societies as a guarantee not only of freedom  but against violence         Two years ago the Nobel peace prize was awarded to Shirin Ebadi  an Iranian lawyer  judge  and activist for the rights of women  children and the oppressed  In announcing her award the Nobel Committee wrote    No country deserves to be labeled civilized unless the rights of women and children are respected     Malalai Joya would agree  She came of age in Afghanistan  s twenty year spiral of war  warlords  extremism  and repression  She had a different vision for her country    one where the law  not the gun  held sway for women and men alike  And she spoke out bravely against the warlords who still tyrannize too many Afghans and stand in the way of the rule of law and the spread of freedom  Two months ago she was a top vote getter in Parliamentary elections and today she sits with 67 women colleagues in the Afghan National Assembly         I  ve been asked to address briefly the rule of law as it affects the role of women and girls around the world  It obviously is part of a much broader agenda that you are discussing  but I commend you for coming to this conference with the important goal of creating an international rule of law movement  because you and many of us around the world know that without the rule of law we do not have a solid foundation for democratic freedom  for peace and stability  and for economic growth      Women like Shirin and Malalai are living in the 21st century the words that John Locke wrote in the 17th century    The end of law is not to abolish or restrain  but to preserve and enlarge freedom     Around the world today  women are struggling to gain access to those levers  They  re using law to preserve and enlarge the freedoms that they  their families  and their entire societies enjoy  Their successes over the last decade form the strongest argument I can imagine for the law  s power to end conflicts  lift lives  and transform societies  The ABA knows this  and your pioneering work on the rule of law in Central and Eastern Europe  as well as your support for women in the law here at home and around the world  has been an important part of that success         But what do we do now to keep that movement going  How do we provide the education so that women and men together are empowered to understand their rights and to act on them  How do we provide better health care and law enforcement so that women and men have the resources they need to keep their families healthy and safe  How do we fight to end the scourge of human trafficking  a modern day form of human slavery        When we talk about the rule of law  especially when we talk about it in other places and recognize leaders who are fighting on behalf of the rule of law  we cannot forget that we  in the United States  have a special heritage and responsibility to uphold the rule of law  That heritage begins with our priceless Constitution and Bill of Rights  But equally important is our centuries long journey toward applying the protection and dignity of those laws to every human being         From our own civil rights and women  s rights movement  we can see shining examples  People like Rosa Parks  who we honored in death for her life and legacy last week  Of those who used our tradition of the rule of law to right the wrongs of the law  We have inspired millions around the world to attempt to do the same  But with that inspiration comes responsibility not to be perfect  for that is impossible  but to admit our mistakes and use the rule of law to mend them  not cover them up  When we fail that standard  we harm the ideals we most seek to promote and undermine the foundations of our own society and our influence around the world         Showing the world that we hold ourselves to the rule of law  even when it is not easy to do  will do more to promote our common values than a dozen public diplomacy listening tours or rule of law speeches  When we show the world that our system is premised on the rule of law  that we do not fear transparency into the workings of our government  when we aim to hold every part of our government accountable  then we much more than in words  but in deeds promote the rule of law  I certainly hope that as we debate these matters right now in the Congress  that the Congress and the Administration will demonstrate that commitment to the rule of law that has always been the hallmark of America         Because it becomes difficult when we promote the rule of law elsewhere if we do not abide by it at home  It makes it more challenging for us to show the world that we value the rule of law and be a catalyst for changes elsewhere  Today for example  I  m sending the President a letter urging him to raise the issue of the rule of law and human rights when he engages in critical summit meetings next week during his visit to the People  s Republic of China   While there has been progress in China  too often laws are ignored with dire consequences for businesses  individuals  and families         I am particularly concerned that 26 years after China enacted its repressive one child policy  officials apparently continue to punish women and couples for bearing children  These abuses have reportedly included denial of social benefits  fines  detention  destruction of property  forced abortion and forced sterilization    everything that runs against our deepest feelings and values  I support the government of the United States speaking out strongly against these coercive measures and at the same time promoting non coercive family planning programs that respect the rights and choices of women         Strength and respect for the rule of law is a value that knows no national boundaries  And social and economic advances can only be lasting if they are built on a foundation of respect for human rights         The rule of law may begin in law books and congressional or legislative debates and courtrooms  It doesn  t end there  It finds its most vibrant expression in the actions of citizens    ordinary men and women who draw courage from the law to take a stand for their own rights and for those of others         Over the past decade  an extraordinary global movement for women  s rights has breathed new meaning into the rule of law  beginning as Karen pointed out  in a most unlikely place  The 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing  Now many doubted that a United Nations conference on women and one held in Beijing would have any impact  And many of you may recall there was a good deal of grumbling about whether the United States should participate and certainly whether I  as First Lady at the time  should participate         But I believe then  as I believe now  I don  t think we promote our ideals and goals by disengaging from those with whom we disagree  I think it is especially important  in fact  to engage in a very assertive way  to make it clear that we stand for different values and ideals and to help bring a consensus into being around them         I thought that this could be a historic conference that would shine a bright light on the issues that matter most in the lives of women and their families  Access to education  health care  jobs and credit  The opportunity to enjoy the full range of political  legal  and human rights  Some of you were there  It was a gathering that lasted only a few days and it had a counterpart in Huairou that was the national nongovernmental organization meeting  and between the two of them it launched a campaign to change laws and change attitudes across our globe         Here in the United States we also took a hard look at ourselves  The Clinton Administration became the first to both understand and publicly state that investments in women and girls should be an integral part of foreign policy  We started the Presidents Interagency Council on Women  which I was honored to Chair  and we followed up on Beijing to make sure that if we were going around telling other countries what they should do to make sure they promoted the rule of law on behalf of women and girls  that we had done all we needed to do at home         We launched the Vital Voices Democracy initiative to help women build democratic institutions and market economies  to get the training they needed personally to participate in the economic and political life of their societies  And that continues as the Independent Nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership         Now it is widely accepted today that focusing on women as a key to building democracies  growing economies  ending conflicts  and strengthening the rule of law is understood  But just ten years ago that was news to a lot of people         And in just ten years we have seen the results as that news has impacted on the political and economic structures of various countries  Nations from Mongolia to Indonesia to Tajikistan are passing better laws  protecting women from discrimination  abuse  and violence         Worldwide  more women than ever are writing laws and enforcing them at the highest levels of government  The proportion of women legislators worldwide has grown every single year  and more women have become heads of state or government in the ten years since Beijing than in the previous 25 years         I think it  s worth noting that some of the fastest growth has come in post conflict countries  where anyone  man or woman  must be particularly brave to enter politics  Afghanistan has had its first woman presidential candidate  its first woman provincial governor  In this year  s legislative elections  women made up ten percent of the candidates and 44 percent of the voters  Female turnout actually rose since the 2004 president elections  When I was last in Afghanistan earlier this year  I met with many of these women  urban  rural  secular  religious who are just anxious to take their place in rebuilding their country         This is also true in Iraq  where women of every faith and ethnicity are braving the very dangerous security conditions to fight for change  Last week  I met with Iraqi women journalists who shared with me how the lack of personal security in the face of a violent  deadly insurgency affects everything they are trying to do   yet they keep trying  The number of voters who have braved that insurgency has continued to increase  They will have a new election on December 15 that will finally choose a legislature to write the rules that will determine women  s rights  personal security  and so much else        Now under Saddam Hussein  women like all Iraqis were brutally repressed  despite the fact they were given rights on paper in the Iraqi Civil Code  I am very alert to the fact that we must ensure that women have rights more than just on paper in Iraq  It would be a cruel irony if when there is an opportunity finally to have an elected government that writes the laws  the legal protections Iraqi women have are lessened or ignored        So there  s a lot to do  The agenda ahead of us  when it comes to women and girls  is full  in part because despite all these advances  and there are so many more that I could reference  women still comprise the most poor  illiterate  and uneducated         Many women lack the most basic rights and the ability to enforce even the rights they have  In Afghanistan  a beloved national poet was beaten to death by her husband after an argument while her own mother stood by  She was 25         I want to focus my call to action on three areas particularly related to the rule of law  First  ending the scourge of human trafficking  second giving women legal and actual control over their health  and third  educating women and men to know and defend their rights         We must prevent and punish violence against women  One of the great advances we made after Beijing was to underscore the point that domestic violence was not cultural  it was criminal  And there needed to be laws in every society against domestic violence         We now face a new and growing form of violence against women  Organized trafficking that enslaves and degrades hundreds of thousands a year  We  ve made progress in raising awareness about this new slavery  but not enough to break the criminal organizations that profit from it         In recent years  first under the Clinton Administration and then under the Bush Administration  we had passed laws against trafficking  We had made it a primary issue in international and bilateral negotiations  and I  m delighted that just this last week we deposited our ratification of the protocol to prevent  suppress  and punish trafficking in persons  especially women and children         But we  ve got to do more to back up our rhetoric with actions  We need to fund the organizations that provide care and legal assistance to the victims of all forms of trafficking  We have to make sure that it is not viewed as a marginal crime to be ignored by law enforcement in countries where it is taking place         We face a particularly horrific problem with re trafficking  I  ve been to countries where there is a very high rate of trafficking of young girls into sexual slavery  brothels  legalized prostitution  And I  ve seen in parts of Southeast Asia  particularly places where you can tell just by driving by which families have sold their daughters and which have resisted  Families who have sold their daughters often have a satellite with television reception or a new vehicle  maybe the first in their family  And I  ve met the girls who  ve been trafficked  sold by their fathers  sometimes escaping  making it back home only to be shunned  facing stigma  and sometimes sold again        We need to do more to both raise the visibility of this issue  recognize that it happens even in the United States  and do more to provide the resources to combat it  and make it a primary objective of any rule of law initiative       We also have to do more to get medical care and health information  particularly family planning information and prevention of HIV AIDS to women and girls  We still face an unacceptably high level of maternal and child mortality in many places in the world         The HIV AIDS pandemic is one of the leading threats to women  In Africa  young women often have absolutely no authority to resist early marriage or sexual advances  In fact  they are three times as likely to contract the virus as young men  They try to protect themselves  but often do so without the full support of the law         In too many places inheritance laws  for example  leave a widow nothing with which to support her children  often sending mothers or daughters into prostitution and continuing the cycle of HIV  Property and divorce laws often leave a woman little control over her situation within marriage and little ability to escape  The rule of law needs to recognize the rights of these women and girls  And although we  ve made some progress in some African countries  we have a long way to go        We also need to ensure that women enjoy the fundamental right to plan their own families and have access to family planning services  Unfortunately in recent years  our government has not been making the commitment to this that I wish it would  We should be attempting to educate people about reproductive health and how to prevent unsafe and unwanted pregnancies         It does not help that we had the Global Gag rule reinstated  which means that no US support can go to local health providers who offer not only abortion or abortion counseling in circumstances that we often would believe is appropriate  but because these organizations often provide a range of services  the failure to fund them means that the full range is shut down  We know that one of the most effective ways to reduce the number of abortions is to empower women to make decisions about their own health         We also need to ensure that the doors of education are open to every girl and boy in every country on every continent  Rule of law societies demand citizens prepare to know and defend their rights  Educating girls is one of the most important ways we can advance the rule of law  Not only are we likely to produce healthier families and lower rates of mortality  malnutrition and disease  educating children  particularly girls  correlates to economic growth  and it is one of our best weapons against the spread of terrorism        I introduced the Education For All Act in Congress last year because serving on the Armed Services Committee  I have had the opportunity to ask a number of officials in the Administration what else we could be doing to combat terrorism  And I recall very well the response that I received from Former Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz  who said the most important thing we could do would be to educate girls and women         So I took that as perhaps a good sign we might actually do something about it and introduced legislation that calls for a clear global strategy to achieve universal global education by 2015  I think making the education of girls a top priority is one of the most important ways we can combat terrorism and advance the rule of law      There is much work to be done  and I think that this conference and the initiative that the ABA has undertaken comes at a particularly timely moment  Not only because of what we see happening around the world as democratic governments such as our own and those in Europe grapple with civil unrest  grapple with the challenge of suicide bombers  and try to figure out how we can maintain open  free societies and provide security and stability to our people         But we know the way forward  Keeping in mind the rule of law gives us the best example that we could have and debating these issues in sessions like the one you  re holding here  using the combined intelligence and experience of people from our own country as well as around the world  is important and more likely to lead us to the appropriate conclusions        Nelson Mandela said in 1989 when he saw a brave young man confronting a Chinese tank in Tiananmen Square  he thought of Rosa Parks  He called it a   Rosa Parks moment     We  ve been thinking a lot about Rosa Parks  and I think that one of the reasons for the great outpouring of support for her  the unprecedented decision to allow her to lie in state  the first woman  the first African American to do so  is serving a great tribute to her life and legacy  but it also demonstrates that at this moment in our own history  we are looking for examples  We are searching for ways that peacefully  we could use the law to make changes here at home and around the world that will benefit ourselves and our children        The Rule of law is a powerful force  It has the potential not only to harness  but unleash human potential beyond our understanding  rooted in the drive for justice  Rosa Parks understood that  She did not come to that day on the bus as a tired seamstress who just decided not to move  She tried to vote three times and had to take literacy tests and was turned down until finally  local officials gave in and allowed her to register         She joined the NAACP and learned about what it would take to be part of nonviolent  civil disobedience  She attended the Highland School  where with other likeminded advocates  she was instructed in ways to take a stand and to make it clear that in this country that believes in the rule of law  we had a lot of work left undone  So on that day on the bus  it may have been a decision that she made in the spur of the moment  but it was a lifetime in making  And it could only have been made within the context of a conviction that the rule of law would finally triumph         That  s what sends people like Shirin Ebadi into Iran  s courtrooms and Malalai Joya onto Afghanistan  s campaign trail  That is what  s driving women and men all over the world to change their societies for the better  And at this point  in American history and international history  it is more important than ever that they be joined by lawyers and judges across the world who are committed to furthering the rule of law and making it possible for every boy and girl to believe that they have the right to grow up and live up to their own God given potential  Thank you all very much
