                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Changes in Implementation Procedures Creates Barriers for Grant Recipients                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today sent a letter to Secretary Mike Leavitt of the Department of Health and Human Services to express concern over how the Health Resources and Services Administration has changed implementation procedures for the Minority AIDS Initiative  MAI   Numerous modifications to the program  including several that were not authorized by Congress  pose a threat to the ability of MAI to adequately address the needs of people living with HIV and AIDS           Minorities bear the brunt of the HIV epidemic in the United States   Senator Clinton said   Placing unnecessary and unjustified restrictions on a program designed to meet the needs of this population will only limit our ability to prevent new HIV infections  engage in testing and outreach  and provide essential care to those living with HIV   It is imperative that you reconsider these changes to the program           The Minority AIDS Initiative is a program that seeks to address the disproportionate impact of HIV AIDS in minority populations  The grant schedule for MAI has previously been March February  but recent changes delay grant awards to late summer  Groups that received grants last year are now experiencing a gap in funding  which ceased on February 28           The Health Resources and Services Administration has also placed a  10 7  million cap on the grant amount awarded to any one jurisdiction  Such a cap would negatively affect New York City and its minority residents who are living with HIV and AIDS  The city has previously received grant awards larger than  10 million to address the epidemic            The following is the text of Senator Clinton s letter to Secretary Leavitt           The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary  United States Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  D C  20201      Dear Mr  Secretary       I write to express my concern with the ways in which the Minority AIDS Initiative  MAI  is being implemented by the Health Resources and Services Administration  HRSA   While the recent reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act changed the program from a formula grant to a competitive grant  there are other changes that the Administration is proposing to the program which were not authorized by Congress  and which will likely adversely affect the ability of Initiative grantees to provide important services to minorities living with HIV and AIDS   At a time when almost half of the new AIDS cases in our country occur among African American populations  and another 20  among Hispanic populations  it is important for us to strengthen our efforts to reach minority individuals living with HIV and AIDS           I have grave concerns about the delays in distributing MAI funding   This program has traditionally operated on a March February grant schedule   However  this year  grants will not be awarded until late summer   Entities that were previously funded through the program stopped receiving funds on February 28   and are now not only left without funding  but without any means of receiving funding for several months   Indeed  the guidance for applying for such grants was only released at the end of last week   Groups that would likely easily qualify for competitive MAI funding are now struggling to survive   Since the MAI was designed to provide assistance to minority run  community based organizations  it remains unclear why HRSA is now setting up a new funding structure that will jeopardize the ability of these organizations to work with their target populations          I understand that HRSA is considering placing the 75 25 core medical services requirement on entities that receive MAI funding   Although some MAI funding is used to provide services  much of the funding is targeted to increase the capacity of these minority run organizations to address HIV and AIDS in their communities   Congress did not direct HRSA to apply this 75 25 requirement to the MAI  and it remains unclear why a core medical services requirement should be applied to a capacity building grant if no services are being provided   I would urge you to ensure that this core medical services requirement will not be inappropriately applied to the MAI program           Finally  I understand that HRSA has placed a cap at  10 7 million on MAI grant funding  so as to limit the amount received by any single jurisdiction   It would seem that this provision is explicitly designed to target New York City  which has in the past received MAI funding in excess of  10 million   Approximately 75  of the individuals living with HIV and AIDS in New York City are African American  Hispanic  or Asian Pacific Islander   in short  the epidemic in the city has a disproportionate impact on minority populations   Capping this grant program will only hurt these individuals  and it is important not to limit the ability of HRSA to provide grants to areas where there is obvious need           Minorities bear the brunt of the HIV epidemic in the United States   Placing unnecessary and unjustified restrictions on a program designed to meet the needs of this population will only limit our ability to prevent new HIV infections  engage in testing and outreach  and provide essential care to those living with HIV   It is imperative that you reconsider these changes to the program          Thank you for your attention to this matter          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
