March 13  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Passage of Critical 9 11 Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Nearly two and half years since the bi partisan 9 11 Commission released its report  the Senate finally took the mantle of leadership that should have been shown by the Bush Administration  to fully implement the remaining recommendations of the Commission  Over five years ago  on September 11th  terrorists  took the lives of nearly three thousand people in the single deadliest attack on American soil in our history  What was clear that day and remains so today  is that the threat posed to us by terrorism requires a great mobilization of American might  muscle  resources  and ingenuity  In protecting our homeland  our country needed leadership  but sadly the Bush Administration and the Republican Congress ignored some of the Commission s most commonsense recommendations   Even in the face of dangerous incompetence in our emergency preparedness and response to Hurricane Katrina  we received tough rhetoric instead of much needed reform   With passage of this important legislation to implement many of the remaining and long overdue recommendations of the 9 11 Commission  we demonstrated the leadership that we have been sorely missing for too long in the fight to safeguard our nation and its citizens   I will continue to fight to make sure that these recommendations are fully implemented and that we do everything needed to ensure our security needs are addressed
