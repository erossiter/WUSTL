July 20  2007 Clinton  Kerry Legislation Requires Pentagon to Prepare for Iraq Redeployment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Click here to listen to the Senators  press conference    Washington  DC  During a joint conference call with reporters this afternoon Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D N Y   and John Kerry  D Mass   will announce their plan to introduce legislation that would force the Pentagon to prepare a report and briefing for Congress on contingency planning for redeploying troops from Iraq   This legislative effort is a direct result of Under Secretary of Defense Eric Edelman s unacceptable response to a Congressional inquiry on a matter of national security to Secretary of Defense Robert M  Gates  asking for the Pentagon to brief the appropriate oversight committees in Congress on what current contingency plans exist for the future withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq   Alternatively  if no such plans exist  the Congressional inquiry asked for an explanation for the decision not to engage in such planning   In response  Under Secretary Eric Edelman sent an unacceptable and outrageous political attack    From New Orleans to Baghdad  this Administration has made planning a dirty word  and the damage to the United States has been immeasurable  said Senator Kerry   Now with American lives on the line in Iraq  the least we can do is force them to draw up contingency plans to redeploy American troops in Iraq  If theres one lesson of the last six years  its with this Administration you cant leave anything to chance  If the Pentagon can draw up plans to bomb Iran  the least they can do is have a plan to redeploy American troops    Redeploying out of Iraq will be difficult and requires careful planning  wrote Senator Clinton   I continue to call on the Bush Administration to immediately provide a redeployment strategy that will keep our brave men and women safe as they leave Iraq  instead of adhering to a political strategy to attack those who rightfully question their competence and preparedness after years of mistakes and misjudgments    Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
