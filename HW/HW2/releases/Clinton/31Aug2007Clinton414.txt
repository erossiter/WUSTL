August 31  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on John Warner s Decision Not to Seek a Sixth Term to the United States Senate                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I will miss serving with my friend and colleague  Senator John Warner  At a time when the tone in Washington is so often defined by partisanship and rancor  Senator Warner has always risen above the fray  focused on what he believed was the right course for our nation  I have been honored to serve alongside him in the Senate and on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Even when we disagreed on serious issues  I always valued his straightforward advice and the wisdom hes garnered in a lifetime of public service  which began when enlisted in the Navy at the age of seventeen    Senator Warner served in World War II and Korea  rose to become Secretary of the Navy  and has brought his leadership and patriotism to bear on big challenges as a Senator from Virginia for nearly three decades  Throughout his tenure on the Senate Armed Services Committee  where he has formerly served as Chairman  he has been a leading voice on issues of national security and a strong advocate on behalf of our brave men and women serving in uniform around the world    The decision to leave the Senate  an institution that he so clearly loves and respects  could not have been an easy one  I hope in his departure from this body  we can all take a page from Senator Warner and the honorable  principled  and faithful execution of his duties to the Senate and the nation
