                                                                                                                                                                                                                        New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement today  in response to the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission  s decision to reject the Defense Department  s recommendations to close Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station            I  m thrilled that the BRAC commission accepted the strong arguments that we made and reversed the decision to close the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station   Thanks to the hard work of the community  the service men and women at Niagara Falls will continue to support our national security and homeland defense   And I m very pleased that the 107th Air National Guard unit will continue to support our national security at Niagara Falls with this new mission   Today  s action will preserve the thousands of jobs that were jeopardized just a few short months ago   I  m proud to represent Niagara Falls Air Reserve station and as a member of the Armed Services Committee  I will continue to fight to support this installation             As New York  s first Senator to sit on the Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has worked to secure funding and support for all of New York s military installations   She has also taken the opportunity to ask numerous questions and discuss the significance of the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station during Senate Armed Services Committee hearings   And she has helped secure millions of dollars in funding for projects that benefit Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station   Niagara s success with these projects shows their value to the military          Only weeks after the 9 11 attacks  Senator Clinton first visited Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station  and in July of 2004 she met with members of the Niagara Falls Military Affairs Council   This past February  the Senator met with the U S  Air Force Chief of Staff  General John Jumper  to discuss and promote New York s Air Force installations including Niagara Falls  and later that month met with Col  Jim Roberts  the Commander of the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station   In April she met with Dr  Phil Grone  Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment  the Defense Department  s point person on BRAC   And in May she met with BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi            Since the May 13th BRAC announcement  Senator Clinton has worked tirelessly to reverse the Defense Department  s recommendations to close Niagara   She immediately visited with Niagara  s community groups to vow to support their installations in the BRAC round  and spoke to General Jumper to express her concerns    Senator Clinton  along with other members of the NY delegation  sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to express concern about DOD  s failure to publicly release installation specific data used to prepare its recommendations as part of the BRAC process          In June  Senator Clinton testified before the BRAC Commission regional hearing in Buffalo on behalf of the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station   She also spoke spoken with Chairman Principi  and met or spoken with each commissioner on behalf of New York  s installations            In July  in response to request from Senator Clinton  the Air Force released site survey information that estimated the costs for implementing its C 130 relocation recommendations to a single base are  292 million  almost three times the Air Force  s estimate provided to the BRAC commission of approximately  102 million            The 914th Airlift Wing  AW  is the lead Air Reserve airlift wing whose night vision goggle capability led to a number of special ops missions in Iraq  They operate the most modern C 130 aircraft in the Air Reserve and were the first Reserve unit sent back to Iraq for a second time  During the early stages of the war  they were the first Air Force unit operationally based 24 7 inside Iraq           The 107th Air Refueling Wing  ARW  at Niagara was recently designated as a permanent member of the Northeast Tanker Task Force  TTF  in addition to the sites in Bangor  ME and Pease  NH  The Task Force supports every aircraft going to Europe and Southwest Asia  Iraq            Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station employs 821 full time and 2 581 guardsmen and has an economic impact of  153 million on the community annually           The BRAC Commission will present their official recommendations to President Bush on September 8  2005   The President will have 15 days to endorse or oppose the Commission  s recommendations   If approved the President will send the BRAC Commission recommendations to Congress   Congress will then have 45 days to endorse or reject the Commission  s recommendations
