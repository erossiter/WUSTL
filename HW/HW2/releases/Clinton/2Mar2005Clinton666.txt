March 2  2005 Clinton Calls on Senate Budget Committee to Prevent the Elimination of Community Development Block Grants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        New York State could lose almost  400 million in funding if program not restored                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Senate Budget Committee to reject the Bush Administration s proposal to essentially eliminate the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  program in his Fiscal Year 2006 Budget  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD   in Fiscal Year 2005  New York cities received almost  400 million in much needed grants through the CDBG  program for affordable housing  social services  neighborhood revitalization and job development    In a bipartisan letter sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  the Senator called for the restoration of what is widely acknowledged as one of the nation s most successful local funding programs     Communities across New York  would be devastated if the President s proposal is not stopped   Senator Clinton said    The Community Development Block Grants program has long been a lifeline for local towns and cities  allowing them to make critical investments that have returns for years to come   Overhauling it in this way is a travesty      Since 1974  this successful program has provided critical funds to cities so that they can make affordable housing available  revitalize run down neighborhoods and provide economic development opportunities to those who need them most   Senator Clinton said   I will do everything I can to try to stop this near sighted proposal     The Bush budget would eliminate the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  and replace it with a new  consolidated program that is supposed to carry out the activities of 18 existing economic and community development programs   This new program is funded at  400 million less than the amount spent on CDBG alone last year   In sum  the 18 programs cost more than  5 6 billion a year and the Bush budget slashes this investment by 33 percent to  3 7 billion   In Fiscal Year 2005  CDBG funding provided  393 million in 2004 to New York State     A copy of the Senators  letter is attached    March 2  2005     The Honorable Judd Gregg     Chairman       Committee on the Budget  United States Senate     Washington  DC 20510        The Honorable Kent Conrad   Ranking Member  Committee on the Budget  United States Senate    Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad    The Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  Program funds housing rehabilitation  supportive services  public improvements and economic development projects in communities across the nation   CDBG serves more than 1 100 entitlement communities  urban counties and states  and more than 3 000 rural communities   We urge the Budget Committee to maintain the Federal government s current commitment to community development programs at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and support a budget allocation of  4 732 billion in Function 450 for CDBG  Section 108 economic development loan guarantees  and the Brownfields Economic Development Initiative    HUD is the Federal Department principally responsible for community economic development   CDBG is the centerpiece of the Federal government s efforts to help states and localities meet the needs of low income communities   Section 101 of the Housing and Community Development Act created the CDBG program to consolidate a number of complex and overlapping programs of financial assistance in order to encourage community development activities which are consistent with comprehensive local and areawide development planning  to further the national housing goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family  and to foster the undertaking of housing and community development activities in a coordinated and mutually supportive manner by Federal agencies and programs  as well as by communities    HUD s community development programs coupled with HUD s housing and homeless programs and supportive services  provide communities with a comprehensive approach to serving the needs of residents   CDBG is the glue that holds other Federal programs serving low income communities together    The Strengthening America s Community proposal aims to create strong accountability standards  offer flexibility to communities and create a more unified federal approach   These goals are already hallmarks of the CDBG program    On the 30th Anniversary of CDBG in 2004  HUD Deputy Secretary Roy Bernardi said the following about the program      HUD has a long history of  being there  and providing help for people  particularly those with the greatest needs   our lower income constituents   CDBG has certainly been there  during boom years and most importantly in times of tightening budgets  which place greater demands on existing services   We must continue to support and build upon programs that work  those that have a proven record of flexibility and the ability to fit in with locally determined needs   CDBG is such a program and ranks among our nation s oldest and most successful programs   It continues to set the standard for all other block grant programs      The Strengthening America s Communities proposal would recreate a block grant program similar to CDBG within the Department of Commerce   The Department of Commerce  however  does not have the vital infrastructure or institutional capacity to provide a comprehensive approach to neighborhood development   Replicating HUD s CDBG program within the Department of Commerce would require rebuilding HUD s  infrastructure  and would result in inefficiencies  greater complexity and less aid to fewer cities  an approach which does not serve America s communities or taxpayers   CDBG s success depends on a locally driven  citizen participation process that provides flexibility and does not take a  one size fits all  approach   The needs of Nashua  New Hampshire  Bismarck  North Dakota  Cincinnati  Ohio  and  Kansas City  Missouri are very different from the needs of Miami  Florida  El Paso  Texas  Pueblo  Colorado  or San Diego  California   CDBG is capable of addressing the diverse needs of these communities whether it is housing rehabilitation  homeownership  supported services for the elderly or children  business development or infrastructure improvements      CDBG is one of the most effective Federal domestic programs to revitalize neighborhoods with proven results   Over 95 percent of CDBG funds went to activities principally benefiting low  and moderate income persons   Twenty eight percent of CDBG funds supported housing activities in distressed communities  24 percent supported public improvements  15 percent went to the provision of public services  and 7 percent supported economic development activities   In FY2004  CDBG housing projects assisted 168 938 households   Public service projects funded with CDBG served 13 312 631 individuals   Economic development programs funded by CDBG in fiscal 2004 created or retained 90 637 jobs for Americans and public improvement projects benefited 9 453 993 persons   CDBG also has a strong record in business retention   CDBG ensured that over 80 percent of the businesses assisted through the program were still in operation after three years       Thank you for your consideration   We look forward to working with you to ensure that communities across the country can provide good jobs  affordable housing  and public services to meet the needs of all Americans          Sincerely
