October 18  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Department of State  s Passport Card Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Click here to listen to audio of Senator Clinton s statement         As I have long maintained  national security and the security of our borders are of paramount importance   But the announcement by the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  that they are submitting for public comment a federal rule for the development of a costly card format passport for international travel by U S  citizens through land and sea ports of entry between the United States and Canada ignores the real and practical concerns of New York  s border communities   The agencies are proposing this passport alternative to meet the requirements of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  but the People Access Security Service  PASS  card proposal  which would require families to purchase cards at a cost of  35 per child and  45 per adult  is likely to have a gravely negative impact on families  tourism  and the regional economy          There is little doubt that the cost of the contemplated PASS card would adversely affect the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the U S  Canada border  The exchange of goods between the United States and Canada is the largest trading relationship in the world   Studies indicate that this vital flow of commerce would decrease dramatically if the contemplated PASS card    or in the alternative  the even more expensive passport    were required to travel between the two countries            Furthermore  the people who live in our shared border areas regard themselves as one community of neighbors   American children play sports in Canadian youth leagues   Canadian families visit relatives who live in the U S  Americans and Canadians frequent each others homes and businesses   Imposing this costly and onerous requirement will adversely affect these communities          I remain committed to a passport alternative that properly balances our mutual interest in a secure northern border with our desire to maintain communities that are both economically and socially vibrant   Unfortunately  the PASS card proposal made by the Department of State and DHS does not yet appear to strike this proper balance
