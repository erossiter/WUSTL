September 27  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the IRA Disarmament                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Another historic moment in the long road to lasting peace in Northern Ireland has been marked   I welcome the news that the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning  IICD  has verified that all of the IRA  s arms have been decommissioned and put beyond use        The importance of this moment will not be lost on those still hopeful that the Good Friday Agreement can be fully implemented   Many in the United States will applaud the action that follows from a promise made by the IRA in July of 2005   These actions today will help move the peace process to a place where both governments  and all parties  can renew efforts to stand up the devolved government in Northern Ireland and address other important issues such as policing and the cessation of all other paramilitary activity        I commend the work of General de Chastelain  the IICD  the Catholic and Protestant witnesses  and all involved to bring this process to completion   We remember all who have struggled through this long process  especially those who have lost loved ones in every community  and the promise the future holds for all the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland   Prime Ministers Blair and Ahern continue to do everything possible to implement permanent peace and the people of the United States should stand with them  and all the parties  to do what we can to make that a reality
