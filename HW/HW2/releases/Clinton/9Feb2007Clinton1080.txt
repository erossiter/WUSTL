February 9  2007 Senator Clinton Reiterates Opposition to the Broadwater Project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Urges Federal Chairman of the Regulatory Commission to Consider Security and Environmental Impacts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   Following the completion of public hearings and the public comment period set down by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton this week reiterated her opposition to the Broadwater Project  In a letter to the FERC Chairman Joseph Kelliher  Senator Clinton highlighted many of the concerns that were expressed during the comment period and urged him to take them into account during his deliberation process            The Broadwater project has enormous implications for the future of Long Island Sound   Senator Clinton said   I  like many Long Islanders  remain concerned that the security risks and environmental threats posed by the project have not been properly addressed  I also share the view held by many Long Islanders that this project would have detrimental impacts on the quality of water and air surrounding the sound  I know that FERC heard from many people during the public comment period and I would urge them to seriously take their concerns into account           Last month at public meetings regarding the environmental impact of the Broadwater Energy project  countless Long Islanders voiced their opposition to the project  The Draft Environmental Impact Statement  DEIS  released by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on the project was found to be problematic by both the U S  Environmental Protection Agency and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation          A copy of the Senator s letter is below       Mr  Joseph T  Kelliher  Chairman  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  888 First Street  N E    Washington  D C  20426      Dear Mr  Kelliher        In January of this year  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  held public meetings to get input on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement  DEIS  that FERC prepared to asses the impacts of the proposed Broadwater Energy project in Long Island Sound    Hundreds of Long Islanders came to the meetings to express their strong opposition to the project   In addition  many residents  non profit organizations  government agencies  and elected officials have submitted comments about the DEIS and the Broadwater project   Though I have written to you about Broadwater in the past  I write today to reiterate my opposition to the project and to express my views about the DEIS            With respect to the project itself  I believe that from the outset  too many questions have gone unanswered regarding security  environmental effects  and the impact this project will have on how Long Islanders use and enjoy the Sound   The safety and security risks involved with this project are numerous and have not been addressed   The review process  to date  has not made clear where the resources needed to secure this terminal and incoming shipments will come from  nor who will bear the burden of first response should an accident occur   I am concerned that the Coast Guard  who are already stretched to the limit by their homeland security responsibilities  will not be able to accommodate the increased security demands that this project requires to protect the Sound and those who use it          In addition  I am concerned about the environmental impacts of the project  and am disappointed in the conclusion of the DEIS that this project is environmentally acceptable   The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation have both identified deficiencies in the DEIS   In addition  many Long Island residents  officials  and groups have filed comments that take issue with the DEIS assessment of the project s potential impacts on air quality  water quality  and the Long Island Sound ecosystem   Many have also pointed to the failure of the DEIS to adequately examine alternatives to the Broadwater project   I share these concerns about the DEIS and urge you to strongly consider these comments and revise the final EIS accordingly            Long Island Sound  an Estuary of National Significance  is a treasured natural resource that is extremely important to Long Islanders  way of life   We have better energy alternatives for Long Island than Broadwater   It is simply the wrong energy project for the Sound  and I urge you to consider the comments closely and reassess your conclusion about Broadwater s compatibility with a clean  healthy Sound that is accessible to Long Islanders            Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
