March 17  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Passage of the Budget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The budget approved by the Senate doesn  t pass the basic tests of fairness  fiscal responsibility and fails to reflect the values of New Yorkers and the American people   While maintaining many of the President  s deep budget cuts to education  health care  and income security for working families  this budget yet again finds room for tax cuts for the wealthy  the giveaway of the Artic Wildlife National Refuge to the oil industry  deeper budget deficits  and the ever growing threat of a national debt which is expected to explode to nearly  12 trillion in just five years      This budget failed to provide adequate funding for our veterans  failed to provide adequate funding for the No Child Left Behind Initiative  failed to provide a long term fix to the growing Alternative Minimum Tax problem for our middle class  failed to reject the deep cuts to college tuition aid and failed to adequately invest in the Community Development Block Program which has become one of the most important tools for economic development and job creation for cities and towns throughout New York    I am also deeply disappointed that Republicans rejected Democratic amendments to make substantive investments in port security  AMTRAK and Avian Flu preparedness and other critical programs       Indeed  the minor improvements made in this budget   including additional funding for LIHEAP and my amendment that restores funding to critical Seniors programs and Alzheimer  s research   do not make up for the fact that once again  the Senate has passed a budget that fails to adequately invest in the American people while embracing policies that worsen the fiscal future and economic security of our nation   As this is only the first step in the budget making process  I will continue to fight for the priorities and values important to New Yorkers and Americans
