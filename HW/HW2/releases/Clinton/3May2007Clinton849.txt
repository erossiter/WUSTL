May 3  2007 Representatives Higgins  Slaughter  Reynolds and Senators Schumer  Clinton Call on Nuclear Workers Advisory Board to Grant Justice to Bethlehem Steel Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Today  Representatives Brian Higgins  Louise Slaughter  and Thomas Reynolds joined Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton in calling on the Advisory Board on Radiation and Workers Health to recommend approval of the petition by former Bethlehem Steel workers to create a  Special Exposure Cohort  for those who worked in Bethlehem Steel s nuclear weapons program during the Cold War   Approval of this petition would make the former nuclear workers eligible to receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program if exposure records do not allow case by case decisions to be made             Approval of this application would give former Bethlehem Steel workers and their families a chance to receive compensation that is long overdue   said Rep  Higgins    These Cold War heroes have suffered with illness for decades due to their service to our country  and it is time to finally correct this injustice and give these workers the compensation they deserve            New York s Cold War heroes deserve justice  not yet another cold shoulder from a heartless bureaucracy  NIOSH must approve the Special Exposure Cohort for Bethlehem Steel workers   it will make all the difference in getting them the compensation they deserve   Schumer said    I have heard heartbreaking stories of friends and loved ones dying of cancers that were caused by exposure to radiation in service to America  Enough is enough   NIOSH must right this past injustice by quickly approving their Special Exposure Cohort application            When it meets this week  the Advisory Board faces a very important decision   whether or not to uphold our collective responsibility to the former Bethlehem Steel workers and their families   This fight has been going on for far too long   In 2000  Congress promised timely compensation to cold war nuclear weapons workers who became ill from radiation exposure  and that promise has yet to be met at Bethlehem Steel   I have testified before the Advisory Board about the plight of the Bethlehem Steel claimants in the past  and I hope the Board considers the stories of these workers and their survivors as they meet this week   I urge the Advisory Board to recommend approval of the Bethlehem Steel Special Exposure Cohort petition and help bring justice to these Cold War heroes   Senator Clinton said           The workers of Bethlehem Steel who risked their lives for our country deserve immediate compensation   said Rep  Slaughter    Despite many incidences of work related illnesses and deaths  former employees of Bethlehem Steel have not found relief because of insufficient records that make dose reconstruction virtually impossible  Approval of this petition will help the employees of Bethlehem steel receive the benefits promised to them in a timely manner  and I urge its support            These Western New Yorkers are heroes and have earned the right to this compensation   said Congressman Thomas M  Reynolds  R Clarence     Too often in the past  the workers have been cut short for what they deserve  and that needs to be corrected           Under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA   those who performed weapons work during World War II and the Cold War who subsequently contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis are eligible to file claims with the US Department of Labor  DOL  for individual payments of  150 000  as well as medical benefits  Patients or their surviving families were required to provide proper documentation of their illness and their employment history in order to file a claim           Payment of these claims is decided by the DOL and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  by using available records about work conditions and employment history to perform a  dose reconstruction process  to determine both the radiation doses received by employees and whether or not radiation exposure was the cause of the employees  illness   However  at certain facilities  such as Bethlehem Steel  workers did not wear individual radiation monitors   Compensation decisions have been made for these workers using a radiation exposure model that relies on data from another facility  the Simonds Saw facility in Lockport  New York   Subsequent studies have shown this dose reconstruction process to be a grossly inadequate measure of these workers  radiation exposure           On March 6  2007 Senators Clinton and Schumer and Representatives Higgins  Reynolds and Slaughter re introduced legislation to amend the criteria by which employees can be added to a special exposure cohort  Former employees added to the cohort would be exempt from the dose reconstruction process  Employees with an eligible cancer who worked at a facility where nuclear weapons work was performed will be presumed to have contracted the cancer from workplace exposure and their claim will be paid             The full text of the letter follows            Paul Ziemer  Ph D  Chair  Advisory Board on Radiation and Workers Health  4676 Columbia Parkway  MS  C 46  Cincinnati  OH 45226      Dear Dr  Ziemer       We urge you to recommend approval of the petition to create a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  for former Bethlehem Steel employees who worked at the plant from January 1  1949 through December 31  1952          We believe this petition should be promptly approved so as to give the necessary relief to former workers and their families  who have struggled for decades because of dangerous exposure to radiation and other particulates           The former Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna  New York played a crucial part in the Cold War and was a lynchpin in Western New York s industrial economy for over a century   Thousands worked long hours and under very difficult conditions to create modern machines  weapons  and devices that were the technological innovations of their time   Work intensified throughout the first years of the Cold War  as our country s demand for modern weapons and machines increased           Work at the Bethlehem Steel plant was hazardous  but at the time  workers had no idea of the immense health risks associated with the uranium rolling   Specifically during weekend shifts  workers would process upwards of 350 tons of uranium material  unknowingly ingesting radioactive dust during the process            Decades later  only after hundreds of former workers developed cancer  did the federal government take responsibility for this travesty   Passage of The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act in 2000 was meant to provide compensation and relief to workers like those at Bethlehem Steel who developed debilitating or fatal diseases due to work related exposure to radioactive material in service to our nation   The law directed the Department of Labor to establish a process  known as Special Exposure Cohort  to decide groups of claims for facilities where a lack of data prevented dose reconstructions from being completed with sufficient accuracy            Bethlehem Steel workers did not wear individual radiation exposure monitors when uranium rolling occurred   The few ambient air samples from between January 1  1949 and December 31  1952 were taken at monitors that were far removed from the rollers where exposure was the greatest   Yet in spite of this complete lack of data about uranium exposure at Bethlehem Steel  NIOSH has used data from other facilities to reconstruct individual radiation doses for Bethlehem Steel claimants   In addition  NIOSH completed its initial profile of conditions at Bethlehem Steel   the document that is the basis for dose reconstruction   without even interviewing surviving workers   Former workers then came forward with information that demonstrated major flaws in the site profile            While NIOSH has made some improvements to their site profile  the data needed to accurately reconstruct dose exposure for Bethlehem Steel workers does not exist   Under these circumstances  EEOICPA requires that Bethlehem Steel be placed in a special cohort          Finally  the denials are not based on records from the Bethlehem Steel plant  but from calculated reconstructions based on sampling from similar plants   Simply stated  it is wrong to deny the former employees of Bethlehem Steel the compensation which  through their hard labor and sacrifice  they have so obviously earned   They served our nation in her time of need  they suffered as a result of this service   through no fault of their own  and now they deserve justice in the form of compensation from the very system that was established to aid those in exactly this situation            There are 717 cases arising from the exposure to nuclear materials at the Bethlehem Steel plant   According to NIOSH  as of March 20  2007  less than half of those claims have resulted in compensation   We believe that this record is unacceptable and that the proposed SEC petition would present a much more equitable and fair result for these families   Therefore  we respectfully request the Board to recommend approval of the petition so that this terrible situation can be laid to rest and the many families who have been wrought with so many tragedies can finally have peace of mind
