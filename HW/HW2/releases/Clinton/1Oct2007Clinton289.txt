October 1  2007 Senator Clinton Welcomes Senate Approval of Measures to Aid Servicemembers and their Families  Address National Security Challenges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Expresses Disappointment that Department of Defense Authorization Bill Does Not Force President to Change Course in Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed Senate approval  as part of the FY 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill  of a series of measures she introduced which will help provide needed benefits for servicemembers and their families  help prevent nuclear terrorism  ensure needed oversight of United States action in Darfur  assess readiness for ground forces within the Army and Marine Corps  and address national security threats posed by global warming   The bill will now be considered by a House Senate conference committee     While I am disappointed that the minority has blocked Democratic efforts in this bill to force the President to finally change course and begin to end the war in Iraq  I am pleased that seven of my amendments were included in this years Defense Authorization bill  said Senator Clinton   Several of these amendments will provide much needed benefits to our servicemembers and their families  others will address national security concerns such as nuclear proliferation and global warming  and another will require a report on the planning and implementation of the policy of the United States to end the ongoing violence in Darfur   I urge the conference committee to take into consideration the benefits of these amendments and include them in the final conference report     The seven amendments introduced by Senator Clinton that were included in the Defense Authorization bill passed by the Senate will       Protect financial benefits for military family members   Senator Clintons amendment will protect financial benefits for military family members by closing gaps in coverage for Death Gratuity and Survivor Benefits beneficiaries  When tragedy strikes and a military service member makes the ultimate sacrifice  minor dependent children and their guardians are excluded from receiving certain benefits and entitlements  In too many cases  pre deployment systems and processes designed to protect military family financial benefits are under resourced or not available and create an unnecessary burden for survivors      Increase burial travel allowances for families of deceased servicemembers  Senator Clintons amendment requires the Department of Defense  DoD  to authorize burial travel allowances for minor siblings of a deceased servicemember  and when necessary  provide burial travel allowances for the person authorized to direct the disposition of the remains  Currently  only spouses  dependent children  and parents of deceased servicemembers are authorized burial travel allowances  while travel for minor siblings of the deceased servicemember is either paid out of pocket  or with emergency funds provided by DoD  In some instances the emergency fund approval process has been untimely  causing a delay in travel plans or an absence of a family member  Additionally  DoD requires servicemembers to designate an individual responsible for burial arrangements as the Person Authorized to Direct Disposition  This person can be a spouse  parent  or another blood relative  however only spouses and parents are authorized burial travel allowances  Travel for a blood relative who is serving as the Person Authorized to Direct Disposition  and who is not a spouse or parent of the deceased servicemember  must pay out of pocket or apply for emergency funds to travel to the burial they are responsible for arranging     Increase Temporary Lodging Expenses  TLE  for servicemembers  Senator Clintons amendment will help the increasing number of servicemembers and their families who are moving to bases without sufficient housing   This problem is especially acute at Fort Drum  New York  where soldiers often have to wait for quarters beyond the 20 day TLE period which greatly inhibits their quality of life  Her amendment provides the Secretary of Defense additional authority to increase the TLE period from 20 to 60 days for those servicemembers moving to a military base experiencing a housing shortage  The current 20 day TLE extraordinary circumstances provision expires on December 31  2008  and the Clinton amendment extends the new TLE authorities for another year to December 31  2009  Under normal circumstances servicemembers receive 10 days of TLE when they conduct a permanent change of station move   When a military base cannot provide quarters within the 10 day TLE period  the Department of Defense can increase the TLE period to 20 days   However  after the 20 day TLE period expires without housing being provided  the servicemember pays out of pocket for temporary lodging until permanent housing is assigned or a rental housing unit is made available     Expand and extend a Government Accountability Office  GAO  study to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the readiness of the ground forces within the Army and Marine Corps  The GAO study would also assess the impact on the ground forces of the troop surge initiated by President Bush  The Senator s amendment is aimed at providing additional transparency of the true readiness of the military  to better identify where Congress can help focus its efforts      Address national security risks posed by global warming by implementing many of the recommendations of a report authored by eleven retired three and four star admirals and generals and released by the CNA Corporation in April  The study  National Security and the Threat of Climate Change  concluded that global warming presents a serious national security threat  The study examines how projected climate changes  such as rising sea levels  more intense tropical storms  and increased flooding and drought  will have destabilizing impacts  including reduced access to fresh water  impaired food production  and displacement of major populations  The study concludes that these impacts could act as a threat multiplier and increase the potential for failed states  cause mass migrations that add to global tensions  and increase conflict over resources      Help prevent nuclear terrorism  Senator Clintons amendment would require the president and relevant federal departments and agencies to work with the international community to create specific minimum standards for the security of nuclear weapons and weapons usable fissile material  to convince other countries to adopt these standards  and to assist other countries in meeting and maintaining them  The amendment would also require an annual report to Congress that would include a prioritized diplomatic and technical plan  including measurable milestones  metrics  estimated timetables  and estimated costs of implementation  to eliminate or secure all weapons usable nuclear material anywhere in the world  and progress in implementing that plan  The report would also include a prioritized list of vulnerable sites around the world with nuclear weapons or weapons usable nuclear material where security upgrades are needed most urgently     Ensure oversight of U S  action in Darfur   Senator Clintons amendment requires the Department of Defense  DoD  and the Department of State to report on the planning and implementation of the policy of the United States to end the violence in Darfur  including any plans for a no fly zone  and ensure appropriate Congressional oversight of U S  activity in the region  The report also requires an evaluation of the government of Sudans compliance with its obligations under international law  In addition  the report calls for a comprehensive assessment of the impact of a no fly zone for Darfur  including on humanitarian efforts in the region  and a plan to minimize any negative impact on those efforts
