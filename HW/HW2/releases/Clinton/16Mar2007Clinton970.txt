March 16  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on News that Administrator Boardman Will Visit Albany on Monday to Outline Plans to Improve Rail Safety in New York State                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I am very pleased that Administrator Boardman has answered my call and will be coming to New York to investigate this issue first hand   I hope that when he is in Albany on Monday  he will announce a state wide investigation  to be conducted as soon as possible          The train derailment in Oneida  New York was the latest in a string of troubling train derailments throughout New York State   These derailments were not isolated incidents and a state wide investigation of railroad safety before the next derailment occurs is paramount            I look forward to working with the Federal Railroad Administration to ensure the safety of our railroad tracks and the towns and cities along those tracks           Following the recent train derailment and explosion in Oneida  New York  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called for an investigation of New York s rail safety   In a letter to the Administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration  Senator Clinton underscored that this is just the latest in a series of recent derailments across New York        Click here for a copy of Senator Clinton s letter to the Federal Railroad Administration
