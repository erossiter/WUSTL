official opening of the media education center         Senator Clinton worked with Discovery Communications to encourage the selection of a New York school for this groundbreaking project  The Discovery Channel Media Education Center features a state of the art television studio allowing students to produce short television programs  exposing them to cutting edge media technology and giving teachers the opportunity to explore new ways of educating            This is a wonderful gift to the students and to the city     said Senator Clinton    Technology is one of the most powerful tools we have to enable us to compete in the global economy and this Media Education Center will give these students    and those who come after them    a wealth of knowledge and experience about communications  media and production that they can take with them into the future  This is an investment in the community that will have enormous potential and I know it will pay dividends for years to come           In choosing Poughkeepsie Middle School as the recipient of the media education center  Discovery Communications and the New York Department of Education considered the school  s location and its proximity to Discovery  s New York office          The Discovery Channel Media Education Center is part of Discovery  s longstanding commitment to extending the power of media and technology to the schools and communities that need it the most     said Judith A  McHale  President and CEO  Discovery Communications    This project is a perfect example of the private and public sectors working together to improve student achievement and self esteem           As part of Discovery  s commitment to the school  the company has donated the equipment for a complete television studio  including three cameras  a video switcher and an audio mixer  Teachers will be provided with training to use the equipment and the middle school will offer eighth graders a course on the technological aspects of a television studio  All students at Poughkeepsie Middle School will be exposed to the media education center through teaching plans that will incorporate components of television production into certain academic programs  such as reporting  scriptwriting  editing  research  public speaking and math  Representatives from Discovery s newest division  Discovery
