May 18  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on  Net Neutrality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC      I support net neutrality   The open architecture of the Internet has been the critical element that has made it the most revolutionary communications medium since the advent of the television            Each day on the Internet views are discussed and debated in an open forum without fear of censorship or reprisal   The Internet as we know it does not discriminate among its users   It does not decide who can enter its marketplace and it does not pick which views can be heard and which ones silenced   It is the embodiment of the fundamental democratic principles upon which our nation has thrived for hundreds of years            I have always  and will continue to strongly and unequivocally support these principles   As I have worked throughout my Senate career to make broadband access readily available throughout New York State and our nation  I believe that maintaining an open Internet coupled with more broadband access is necessary if we are to meet the promise and the potential of the Internet to disseminate ideas and information  enhance learning  education and business opportunities for all Americans and improve and uplift our citizenry          We must embrace an open and non discriminatory framework for the Internet of the 21st century   Therefore  it is my intention to be an original cosponsor of the Dorgan and Snowe net neutrality legislation to ensure that open  unimpaired and unencumbered Internet access for both its users and content providers is preserved as Congress debates the overhaul of our nation  s telecommunications laws   Any effort to fundamentally alter the inherently democratic structure of the Internet must be rejected
