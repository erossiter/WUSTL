August 13  2007 Clinton Reiterates Opposition to Allstate Decision to Terminate Coverage for Policy Holders in Westchester  Long Island  New York City                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Calls on Allstate to Reconsider Plan which is Beginning to Impact Many Residents and Homeowners  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on Allstate Insurance Company to reconsider its decision to terminate homeowner s coverage for existing policy holders in Westchester  Long Island and New York City    Allstate announced last year that it plans to cease writing policies for new homeowners and will not renew policies for current policy holders in Westchester  Long Island  and New York City  At the time  Senator Clinton called on the Allstate leadership to reconsider and explain their irresponsible decision  As policy holders are now being denied  Senator Clinton today wrote again to Allstates CEO  calling for a detailed explanation for the companys actions  and urging the company to resume writing homeowners insurance policies for residents in Westchester  Long Island  and New York City    I am very disturbed to hear that Allstate is continuing with their plans to drop the policies of the customers in downstate New York  Westchester  Long Island and New York City have all been hit by severe floods in recent months and last weeks floods are just another reminder of how serious the threat can be to peoples homes and lives  New Yorkers who take out insurance are being responsible and they should not be penalized or have to face the impossible choice or sky high premiums or no coverage at all  Senator Clinton said    Allstates action is part of efforts begun by the company in 2006 to lower its hurricane risks along the countrys eastern coast  However  their practice has been criticized as other insurers who provide coverage in the same areas and who are exposed to the same risks have not taken similarly drastic measures  The action by Allstate also leaves their present policy holders in a bind as they must now search for new insurance carriers and face the possibility of higher premiums     A copy of Senator Clintons letter to Allstate CEO Thomas J  Wilson follows      Mr  Thomas J  Wilson  Chief Executive Officer  Allstate Insurance Company  2775 Sanders Road  Northbrook  Illinois 60062   Dear Mr  Wilson    I write you today to express my deep concern over recent actions taken by Allstate in Westchester County  Long Island  and New York City  According to recent reports  Allstate has stopped writing policies for homeowners coverage in these areas  and has dropped existing policy holders from coverage     While these efforts may be in your companys long term interests  however  it has created an immediate and significant hardship for the policyholders that you continue to drop  These policyholders will now face significantly higher premiums as they seek coverage  making it difficult for them to absorb the costs     It is my understanding that your decision was based on a hurricane risk management strategy that your company implemented last year  However  it is still not clear how the perceived risk justified your sudden decision to deny coverage to your customers in New York     Moreover  other insurers in the same areas and presumably exposed to the same risks  have not taken the extreme steps you have  These other insurers  with smaller market shares than Allstate and their risk concentrated among a significantly smaller pool of policyholders  have not dropped policies based on the threat of hurricanes    I would appreciate a detailed explanation of the decision to drop coverage for these homeowners  Further in the absence of any compelling argument for the drastic method in which existing policyholders are being dropped  I would urge you to reconsider your decision     Thank you for taking this into consideration and I look forward to your reply    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
