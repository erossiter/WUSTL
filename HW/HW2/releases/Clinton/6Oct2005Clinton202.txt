October 6  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on Department of Justice to Restore Funding for the Capital District Women  s Bar Association Legal Project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a letter to the Department of Justice  DOJ  urging the restoration of funding for the Capital District Women  s Bar Association Legal Project  which assists women who have been victims of domestic violence and sexual assault in Upstate  NY   Under President Bush  s authority  the Department of Justice denied funding to this model program  and it now faces the prospect of having to shut its doors unless additional funding is identified            I am outraged that such a valuable program   the only one of its kind in Upstate  New York   may have to close its doors     Senator Clinton said    This is exactly the type of project that the Legal Assistance for Victims program should be supporting  and I hope the Department of Justice will reconsider the application   said Senator Clinton           Please see attached letter          October 5  2005         Ms  Diane Stuart  Director  Office of Violence Against Women   United States Department of Justice  Suite 920  800 K Street  N W   Washington  D C   202530         Dear Ms  Stuart          I write to urge you to reconsider your office  s decision to deny funding to The Capital District Women  s Bar Association Legal Project  CDWBA Legal Project   an award winning legal services organization in upstate New York dedicated to assisting victims of domestic violence and sexual assault          Your financial support  through the Legal Assistance for Victims  LAV  grant program  has enabled CDWBA Legal Project to aid more than 4000 victims of domestic violence and sexual assault since 1996   CDWBA Legal Project targets the   working poor      women whose income is too low to hire a private attorney but too high to receive public legal services   With your support  the attorneys at the CDWBA Legal Project have assisted women in their efforts to protect themselves and their children from abusive partners and husbands   The program has been so successful that the United States Office of Justice Programs identified it as a   best practices program    in 2003  a model for communities striving to better serve and protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault          Unfortunately  the CDWBA Legal Project received notice on September 15  2005 that its application for continued funding had been denied  and the CDWBA Legal Project now faces the possibility of shutting down   The CDWBA Legal Project must contemplate laying off staff  including its Legal Director  Victim Services Coordinator  and staff attorneys  and ending critical services for battered women   This is particularly troubling because The CDWBA Legal Project is the only comprehensive legal services program in upstate New York          The Office of Violence Against Women has supported the CDWBA Legal Project  s efforts on behalf of battered women for nearly a decade   I hope that you will reconsider your decision and instead opt to continue funding for this critical program   Thank you for your consideration   Please do not hesitate to contact me if I may be of assistance            Sincerely yours             Hillary Rodham Clinton
