                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has joined with fellow Senate Democrats in urging the Department of Homeland Security to issue a formal statement reassuring immigrant victims of Hurricanes Rita and Katrina that they can seek help from relief agencies without fear of deportation or being turned over to immigration authorities  In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff  the Senators asked that in light of the magnitude of the tragedy caused by the hurricanes  the ongoing need for relief  and the continuous risk to public health and safety involved  such an assurance should be issued to the hurricane  s immigrant victims as soon as possible        The Senators   correspondence follows an earlier letter to Secretary Chertoff  calling for a formal statement reassuring immigrants impacted by Hurricane Katrina that they might seek help from relief agencies without fear that the federal government will seek to deport them         Copies of the Senators   letters are attached        September 22  2005        The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC 20528        Dear Secretary Chertoff        As you know  we sent you a letter  dated September 14  strongly urging that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  issue a formal statement reassuring immigrants victimized by Hurricane Katrina that they may seek help from relief agencies without fear that the federal government will seek to deport them          To date  we have not received a response to our letter   In fact  we were surprised and troubled to learn that DHS has placed some individuals in deportation proceedings after these individuals sought assistance  despite the fact that the government had previously encouraged all storm victims to come forward to seek help         After Hurricane Rita reached the Gulf Coast  we write with new urgency to request again that DHS issue assurances that all individuals affected by this dangerous storm may seek relief without fear that their names will be turned over to federal authorities for immigration enforcement purposes   Particularly given the widely publicized reports that DHS will deport some immigrant victims of Katrina who sought assistance  we believe such a public assurance is crucial   Some in the Gulf Coast  s immigrant communities will no doubt be too afraid to seek assistance as they evacuate or look for shelter if they believe they might be deported as a result   For many  this could be a matter of life and death         We hope that you will act expeditiously to assure clearly and publicly all those in the path of the storm that they may seek shelter and other assistance without fear  We also urge you to exercise your discretion to terminate removal proceedings against those individuals who were placed in proceedings after they sought assistance        Sincerely         Harry M  Reid   Richard Durbin    Democratic Leader  Assistant Democratic Leader      Hillary Rodham Clinton  Maria Cantwell  Barack Obama  Russ Feingold  Daniel Akaka  Frank R  Lautenberg  Joseph Lieberman  Carl Levin  John F  Kerry  Christopher J  Dodd  Patrick J  Leahy  Jon S  Corzine               September 14  2005   The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC 20528        Dear Secretary Chertoff         We write to strongly urge that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  issue a formal statement reassuring immigrants victimized by Hurricane Katrina that they may seek help from relief agencies without fear that they will be turned over to immigration authorities or that the federal government will seek to deport them  As you know  after the September 11 attacks  then INS Commissioner James Ziglar issued a statement encouraging undocumented immigrants to contact local authorities for help  and stated they could do so without fear that the agency would use their information for immigration purposes  In light of the magnitude of the tragedy caused by Hurricane Katrina  the ongoing need for relief  and the continuous risk to public health and safety involved  we urge you to issue such an assurance to the hurricane  s immigrant victims as soon as possible         Tens of thousands of immigrants  including large populations of Mexicans  Hondurans  and Vietnamese  live in the areas hit hardest along the Gulf Coast  Officials in Mexico estimate that 145 000 Mexicans alone may have been displaced by Hurricane Katrina  Many of these immigrants are undocumented  and few have sought help from relief agencies or gone to shelters for fear that they will be turned over to federal authorities for deportation  We understand that some legal immigrants who lost all of their documents in the hurricane are also afraid to seek help         DHS officials have publicly stated that rescuers have not been asking about immigration status  and President Vicente Fox of Mexico has said the United States agreed with his request not to prosecute undocumented Mexican migrants affected by Katrina who turn to U S  officials for help  However  we believe a clear statement by DHS confirming that information on undocumented immigrants will not be shared with immigration authorities is necessary in order to ensure the public health and safety  Thank you for your attention to this matter  We look forward to your response         Sincerely         Harry M  Reid   Democratic Leader  Richard Durbin   Assistant Democratic Leader  Hillary Rodham Clinton
