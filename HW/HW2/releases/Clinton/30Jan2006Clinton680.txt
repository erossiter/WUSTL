January 30  2006 Clinton Calls For Pentagon Investigation of Body Armor Reimbursement Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    In response to press reports today revealing that the body armor reimbursement program may not be reaching all servicemembers eligible to apply  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called for the Inspector General of the US Department of Defense to investigate this program          The full text of the letter sent today by Senator Clinton follows        January 30  2006       The Honorable Thomas F  Gimble   Acting Inspector General   Department of Defense    Dear Mr  Gimble          In light of the recent press revelations that the body armor reimbursement program may not be reaching all servicemembers eligible to apply  I urge the Department of Defense Inspector General  s office to investigate the administration of this program  including an examination of whether the program is being publicized to the fullest extent possible to those still serving on active duty and those who have left active service           According to recent press reports  only 70 service members have sought reimbursement for gear they purchased prior to deployment under the Congressionally mandated body armor reimbursement program    Yet there have been numerous press reports concerning soldiers purchasing their own armor which suggests that additional servicemembers qualify for the program but have not applied for reimbursement   Indeed  according to media reports  even the Army has been surprised by the low volume of claims   The disparity seems to indicate that the general population is as of yet unaware of the program and reimbursement procedures   Our duty is not only to provide the best equipment to our troops serving in harms way  it is also to afford them opportunity for appropriate compensations as guaranteed under the law            Our soldiers make up the best fighting force in the world  We owe them nothing less than our fullest efforts in providing them the best gear and reimbursing them when they are forced to purchase additional armor on their own           I look forward to your prompt response            Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
