September 29  2006 Senator Clinton Underscores Need to Ensure that People Living With HIV and AIDS Get the Services They Need and Deserve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Proposed Bill Would Devastate HIV AIDS Treatment in New York          Washington  DC    In remarks today on the Senate floor  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton underscored the devastating consequences the proposed bill to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act would have on New York   Senator Clinton emphasized her commitment to making sure that all of those living with HIV and AIDS have the care they need and emphasized her commitment to reworking this proposal in order to ensure that states across country have the funding they need   However  taking funding away from New York and other states with the highest rates of HIV and AIDS would only make matters worse              As a Senator from New York  which has experienced the heaviest burden of the AIDS epidemic  I don t think anyone cares more about this legislation  I understand completely the profound importance of the Ryan White CARE Act  I m committed to the reauthorization of a good bill that strengthens and improves the ability of all Americans to access HIV and AIDS care  support  and treatment  But a bill that destabilizes existing systems of care and devastates  even destroying the ability of high prevalence communities to address needs  is unacceptable   I stand ready to work with my colleagues on a fair  open minded  nonpartisan  practical solution     Senator Clinton emphasized on the Senate floor          The full text of Senator Clinton  s remarks on the Senate floor follows       Floor Remarks of Senator Clinton on the Ryan White Care Act      In 1990  Congress enacted a law that has been a vital part of our national strategy to fight AIDS and HIV  The Ryan White CARE Act  which directs support and resources to the people and places most in need throughout our nation   It was an incredible act of compassion  smart decision making and bipartisanship  Members in this chamber put aside politics  recognized the seriousness of the crisis and took action  how far we have come  Unfortunately  though  the recent debate around the Ryan White CARE Act has been marred by misconceptions and mired in politics  And it s time to set the record straight           First  some of my colleagues have alleged that New York receives more funding per case than the national average  suggesting that New York is somehow getting more than its fair share  But the numbers I  ve heard being used on the floor yesterday only represented part of the funding under the Ryan White Care Act  skewing the data to make a political point  When you look at the whole picture and see the funding under the whole bill  the story is very different           According to an analysis prepared by the Communities Advocating For Emergency Aids Relief Coalition  the CAEAR Coalition  as seen here  the national per case allocation for people with AIDS is  4 745  Here s the state by state breakdown   New York is by no means at the top and this analysis does not even account for the higher cost of living and treatment in my state   You know  some of my colleagues have cried foul  saying they get far less per person with AIDS than New York  I heard my friends and colleagues from Wyoming and Alabama making that point  but here are the facts  and they say otherwise  When you look at all of the titles under the Ryan White Care Act  Wyoming and Alabama actually receive more per person with AIDS than New York and more than the national average  The difference between Oklahoma and New York is about  100 per person living with AIDS  and again  these numbers do not account for differences in costs           Second  there are those making misleading statements about my state  that we misuse funding or do not use the funding we receive  claims that are simply not true  Some have even asserted that New York has allowed dog walking to count under the CARE Act  Well let me set the record straight  New York is not using federal dollars for such services  And to point fingers and make such outlandish assertions impugns my state and is profoundly unfair to the thousands of New Yorkers who rely each and every day on the Care Act for treatment and needed services           New York has been audited by the HHS  the Health and Human Services Inspector General   They said New York complies with all requirements and is not misspending or mismanaging its funds  Another specious claim is that New York is somehow not even using the funds which we received  that we retain surpluses every year  Well  being fiscally responsible is good management  In New York  a tiny percentage of unspent funds are carried from one year to the next  This year  New York carried about  3 million over  representing about three days worth of expenses  That s exactly what I want states to do  manage resources wisely and avoid interruptions in care or create waiting lists  Sound fiscal management I don t believe is something to denigrate           Third  we are having a debate now over a shrinking pot of funding at a time when I absolutely agree  more and more states have greater and greater needs  But to argue about the formula instead of arguing about the program and what it needs to be funded appropriately seems like a diversion to me  We re having a formula fight when we should be focused on fixing our strategy and strengthening our funding to meet the growing challenge and crisis of HIV AIDS in America  That is the real debate we should be having on the floor of the Senate           Here is a chart that shows the increase of people living with HIV AIDS in the United States  That s this line right here  And it shows the declines in funding for Title 1 of the Care Act  so you can see the disparity  I have a great deal of sympathy for my friends from states that are just realizing the full extent of the AIDS crisis in their communities  who are deeply concerned by the fast growing number of such cases among poor women  among our African American and Hispanic populations  But here s part of the reason why we re in this dilemma  Here s the number of AIDS cases  and here s the amount of funding available to deal with them  Instead of honoring our moral obligation  instead of strengthening our efforts  as the epidemic continues to grow  state and local agencies and community groups have been forced to do more with less  And this is especially true in New York  a state that has been hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic           You know  back in the 1980s and 1990s people were moving from other states to be able to come to New York where  at least they thought  somebody would care enough to try to take care of them  And New York still leads the nation in both the number of overall HIV AIDS cases as well as the number of new HIV infections each year           Now  what s this fight about  Well  I ll tell you  New York stands to lose more than  78 million in funding over the next five years  We would see New York City lose  17 million next year alone  But we know who would really lose    the patients whose health and lives are on the line  With the exception of the AIDS Drug Assistance Program  which still does not go nearly far enough given the long waiting lists for the poorest and the sickest of those who cannot afford the drugs they need to stay healthy and alive  the CARE Act has been cut over the past three years even as costs and the number of people with the virus have risen  adding to the pressure on New Jersey  New York  and other states with higher costs of living and the largest numbers of people living with HIV and AIDS  In addition  the Ryan White CARE Act is the payer of last resort  It is the safety net for the safety net  And this Congress and the administration have spent years trying to cut big holes in both           In fact  the CARE Act is only part of the strategy against this terrible disease  The Medicaid program serves nearly half of those living with HIV and AIDS in America and this Republican congress and the Republican administration have tried time and time again to cut Medicaid and have succeeded in passing drastic reductions          I ve introduced bipartisan legislation with my colleague  Senator Gordon Smith  The Early Treatment For HIV Act  This legislation would provide federal funding to extend Medicaid eligibility to low income Americans living with HIV before they develop symptoms allowing them to access life extending medical services  And there are those suggesting that somehow the epidemic has changed  trying to pit one part of the country against another  trying once again to divide us           My Republican colleagues have told me there s not enough money to prevent cutbacks for New York and other states that lose under this proposed formula  Nine states  plus Puerto Rico lose  Every other state makes gains  So  in effect you want to take money away from my 100 000 people living with HIV AIDS and give it to worthy people in other parts of the country because this administration and this congress won t put more money into funding treatment programs for HIV and AIDS           My colleagues on the other side have still refused to provide us with a guarantee  at a time when the epidemic continues to grow  that New York and the other states facing losses will not lose out     a guarantee meant to make sure that people dying with AIDS have the treatment they need  In fact  the White House and Republican leadership in the Congress are cynically pressuring many of my colleagues that if they don t reauthorize the bill this year  they will face cuts in funding next year  But approving a fundamentally flawed bill under pressure  that will end up hurting people living with HIV and AIDS  is the wrong thing to do  We should be working to strengthen the Care Act for everyone           You know  the epidemic is expanding  There s no doubt  Forty thousand new HIV infections occur every year in the United States and they have a disproportionate impact on people of color  In my state  African Americans account for 45 percent of the total population living with HIV and AIDS  while Hispanics account for an additional 29 percent of the cases  But this bill cuts funding for both  Groups such as the National Minority AIDS Council  the Hispanic Federation  the Latino Commission on AIDS  have expressed concern over these cuts that would limit access to care for far too many people of color and people of modest  limited means           We re also seeing the infection rate rise among women  In New York alone  over 30 000 women living with HIV and AIDS  Women would also be shortchanged on the latest version of the CARE Act   Indeed  the version of the bill my colleagues want to bring up would flat fund what s called Title 4  the very programs designed to address the needs of women  infants  and children    the populations that so many have come to this floor and spoken about eloquently  Well  let s put the money where our mouths are  Let s put more money into this program so we re not picking between a poor African American woman in New York City and a poor African American woman in Alabama           And the epidemic is spreading  People talk about the south  They  re talking not only about Alabama and North Carolina  but Washington  D C   Texas  Florida and Maryland  places that have been the hardest hit by this epidemic  Texas and Florida alone account for about 20 percent of people living with AIDS  Yet Florida  too  would lose money under this proposal  As we decide to beat the growing AIDS epidemic in our nation  I hope that we can look at the facts about how the program works now and try to come to a bipartisan solution that covers the entire country s needs and leads to a real solution  not a political one           We know there are solutions  Those of us representing the states that are going to be giving up money  so money can be shifted to take care of other people who are worthy and deserve help  have proposed solutions  And this is not about politics  This is about how we help people  You know  my colleagues from New York  from New Jersey  Illinois and Florida  we ve proposed a one year extension for the Ryan White CARE Act  So let s then extend it for a year and then let s figure out how we can fix it  I think we could raise the authorization levels across the titles by 3 7 percent  set up a grant program to address unmet needs in states that do not receive Title 1 funding in order to address the challenge in rural areas where HIV incidence has also increased  Our proposal would delay penalties for those who cannot meet the HIV reporting requirements and give them time to come into compliance with the CDC            As a Senator from New York  which has experienced the heaviest burden of the AIDS epidemic  I don t think anyone cares more about this legislation  I understand completely the profound importance of the Ryan White CARE Act  I m committed to the reauthorization of a good bill that strengthens and improves the ability of all Americans to access HIV and AIDS care  support  and treatment  But a bill that destabilizes existing systems of care and devastates  even destroying the ability of high prevalence communities to address needs  is unacceptable  I stand ready to work with my colleagues on a fair  open minded  nonpartisan  practical solution  In the spirit of the original bill that brought people together to develop a strategy to combat this horrible epidemic that has caused so much death and destruction  destroyed so many lives  created such a challenge to our health care system and our basic values Mr  President  we can do this if we really want to  All it takes is to narrow the gap between these two lines  HIV AIDS cases and the amount of funding available           You know  some of the priorities that we re asked to vote on in this chamber certainly don t reflect the pressing needs that I ve heard described on this floor  So  Mr  President  I would hope we could come up with a real solution for the Ryan White CARE Act
