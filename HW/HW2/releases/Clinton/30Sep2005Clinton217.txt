September 30  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Allocation of Homeland Security Funding Based on Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           After years of fighting for threat based funding  I am pleased that a House and Senate Conference Committee has finally agreed to adopt a first responder funding plan that recognizes that New York and other high threat targets need and deserve more funds to adequately protect our citizens         I have long maintained that protecting the security of our citizens and our Homeland is the most important responsibility I bear as a U S  Senator   To that end  I believe that to truly make America safe  we need to carefully allocate our homeland security resources   We need to make sure that the money gets to where it is needed  that our American cities and states living under the greatest threat receive the funding they need to protect themselves   Unfortunately  up until now  a substantial portion of our Homeland Security money has been allocated according to congressionally mandated formulas that bear little relation to need and risk         I have advocated for the threat based allocation of Homeland Security funds for several years now  and last year  the 9 11 Commission joined me by urging Congress to   base federal funding for emergency preparedness solely on risks and vulnerabilities      While I still think we can do more to address our most striking vulnerabilities by adopting an even more effective threat based funding plan  the recognition by my House and Senate colleagues that we must distribute the bulk of our limited resources according to threat and risk is welcome news and certainly a significant accomplishment toward that goal
