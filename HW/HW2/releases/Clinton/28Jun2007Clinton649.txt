                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senators Worked Closely with Committee to Include Funding in Spending Bill    1 Million Dollar Designation will be Split Between Lake Chautauqua and Two Other National Projects   Weed Phenomenon is Spreading Throughout the Lake and Could Hurt Boating and Tourism for Decades if Aggressive Steps Aren t Taken Right Now                                                                 Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Energy and Water Development FY08 Appropriations Bill which includes  1 million for the Lake Chautauqua  New York Aquatic Plant Control to share with two other national projects   Federal funds will be used to combat an invasive aquatic plant control problem  which is causing severe economic and ecological impact on Lake Chautauqua in western New York   The invasive weeds  known as Eurasian Milfoil  are taking over the lake and wreaking havoc for local boaters  residents  and tourists who can no longer navigate the lake without encountering the odorous weeds   The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process   Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include funding for the project in this years spending bill    This is very good news for all of us who fear the weeds are devastating the lake  Schumer said  With these funds  the Army Corp will be able to go in and conduct a full study to root out the milfoil problem before more irreparable damage is done  Chautauqua Lake is the gem of Chautauqua and we need to be doing everything we can to keep it clean  safe  and beautiful    The health and usability of Chautauqua Lake have been severely threatened by this invasive weed  The weeds have not only impacted popular summer activities like fishing and sailing that are an economic engine for the County  they have also marred the view of this beautiful lake  We simply cannot let this picturesque lake and its proud history as an economic engine for the region be drowned in invasive weeds  I am thrilled that our Senate colleagues have approved these funds so we can get the Army Corps started on clean up efforts as soon as possible  This will definitely set us on the right path to bringing back tourism  recreation and the postcard perfect view to the lake  Senator Clinton said    Lake Chautauqua  New York Aquatic Plant Control will use these funds to combat an invasive aquatic plant control problem  which is causing severe economic and ecological impact on Lake Chautauqua in western New York    The recreational industry  on which the regional economy depends  has been impaired despite best efforts of local officials to address the problem   The  1 million in federal funds has been allocated to the ACOE to be split between Lake Chautauqua and two other lakes in the country    The rise of the Eurasian Milfoil  which has spread exponentially in the Southern Basin of the lake  has led to concerns over human and aquatic health  noxious odors  unsightly tangles of weeds on shore  and clogged unnavigable waterways for recreational boaters  This invasive species of plant has placed an enormous hardship on local governments  which have organized the Chautauqua Lake Management Commission that for the first time establishes a unified lake management program to tackle the problem  Homeowners are also worried about property values as the Milfoil has become unsightly and emit a foul odor     On February 13  Schumer sent a personal letter to Lieutenant General Carl A  Strock  Commander and Chief of the Army Corps on the Army Corps asking him to immediately step in to assist state  local  and community efforts to eradicate the weeds   Following this request  the Army Corps did an initial inspection of the weeds at the lake in May   Senator Clintons office has also been working with the Chautauqua County Lake Association on this critical issue and both offices have had representatives tour the lake to see first hand the devastation these weeds have caused    Invasive species are non native plants  animals  insects or other organisms that can cause harm to the environment  farm land  crops  bodies of water  and even human health  Invasive species are a form of biological pollution and are recognized as one of the leading threats to biodiversity in Upstate New York  Invasive species attack all aspects of Upstate New Yorks agricultural and environmental sectors and have been around since the beginning of international commerce
