May 5  2006 Senator Clinton Announces Key Senate Committee Approval of Provisions to Address Continuing Pay Problems for Wounded Soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Clinton Amendment Would Establish Army Toll Free Assistance Line for Soldiers and Families  Would also Require Army Audit of Existing Problems      Amendment Included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill Approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee has approved a significant initiative  that she sponsored  to address the continuing financial problems being experienced by our wounded troops          The provision was included in the FY 2007 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill  which was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee yesterday  The passage of the bill marks the first stage in the Department of Defense appropriations process  Now that the authorization bill has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  the bill will be sent to the Senate floor before heading into the appropriations process  The House of Representatives passed their version of the bill Wednesday          In a continuing effort to ensure that those who have given so much are not further burdened with resolving pay account issues  Senator Clinton  s wounded soldier pay audit amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a toll free call assistance center focused on providing wounded members of the Armed Forces  or their primary next of kin  with help relating to military pay issues   The Senator  s amendment also requires the Department of the Army to conduct an audit of its wounded soldiers   pay accounts and report back to Congress in 120 days              I am deeply troubled  as I think we all should be  about continuing reports of soldiers who have been withdrawn from combat on the basis of medical issues and have experienced payroll problems or have been wrongly charged for certain services or equipment   It is simply unacceptable that we should be billing our soldiers for debts wrongly incurred or exacerbated by bureaucratic pay and personnel systems     Senator Clinton said     We must do everything in our power to avoid placing wounded soldiers in the position of having to resolve payroll problems or to request debt forgiveness  These warriors are recovering from the injuries they sustained while they were fighting for our country and they should not have to deal with this kind of additional burden             As recently as April 26  2006  a Government Accountability Office report found that nearly 1 300 battle injured soldiers and soldiers killed in combat in the first 4 years of the Global War on Terror had incurred a total of  1 5 million in debt   Press reports have also revealed that the Army has granted more than 600 requests by soldiers for debt forgiveness   totaling more than  600 000   on the basis that the debt was wrongly charged           This is just the latest in a series of actions taken by Senator Clinton on this significant issue as the treatment of wounded soldiers remains one of her top priorities   In the past  she has called on Congress to hold hearings  written to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army to investigate specific cases  and called for reviews of the broader problems with the pay process  particularly as it applies to those wounded in a combat zone
