                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed passage by the U S  House of Representatives of its version of the 2007 Farm Bill  Senator Clinton recently outlined her priorities for the Senate version of the Farm Bill    Today the U S  House of Representatives passed its version of the farm bill that will provide agricultural  rural  and nutritional funding and programs for the next five years   The bill included several priorities that I have advocated for on behalf of New Yorkers  including smart dairy policies  mandatory country of origin labeling  investment in rural economic development  rural broadband strategy  expansion of various specialty crop programs  production and local processing and language to delay the consideration of USDA field office closings    In addition  I applaud the Houses ability to include additional funding for nutrition programs by closing the loophole for tax evading offshore companies    The reauthorization of the Farm Bill provides a unique opportunity for us to look out for our agricultural and rural communities  We have to make sure that we do everything we can to continue the programs that work and fix those that dont  A chance like this to enhance and improve essential farming programs only comes along once every five years  and I am excited to seize this opportunity to secure the future of our farming families and communities  I look forward to working with the Senate Agricultural Committee to make the best case for our producers  I am hopeful that the Senate s version of the bill will contain many of the same priorities that were included in the version the House passed today    Addressing these vital areas of concern for New York and the rest of rural America is critically important to our producers and farmers   I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to reauthorize the current farm bill  which is set to expire at the end of September    Senator Clinton recently wrote to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin and Ranking Member Saxby Chambliss outlining her support for existing programs and urging the Committee to consider a number of

impacting producers of honey  apples and many other crops    Energy   Senator Clinton urged the Committee to continue the innovative programs that were authorized in the 2002 Farm Bill to help farmers

Investment to Strengthen our Economy Act  Rural RISE Act   Senator Clinton committed to working with the Committee to promote a rural development framework to help rural communities and businesses to compete in a in a globalizing economy  including increased investment and a coordinated approach to rural innovation  investment  and regional collaboration    Broadband   In addition to introducing
