June 19  2007 Senator Clinton  Colleagues Call for Prompt Action in Remedying Passport Delays                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Call on Department of State to Outline Steps Being Taken to Fix Broken System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined several of her Senate colleagues in expressing concern about extensive delays in processing and delivering passports   The delays are the result of a sharp increase in demand for passports as a result of implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI     In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  Senator Clinton and her colleagues asked that the State Department immediately develop and implement a plan to eliminate the current backlog in passport applications  immediately cease to charge unwarranted expedition and delivery fees for passports  and restore normal processing times and explain how the Department intends to deal with the potentially large numbers of people applying for passports if they continue with their plans to implement WHTI at the Northern and Southern Borders    If the State Department cant handle the volume of passport applications for vacationers  I am very concerned about how they will be able to handle the additional volume if they proceed with their requirement to provide passports at the Northern Border  Senator Clinton said    In addition to significant delays  the State Department is also charging expedition and delivery fees to applicants  despite the fact that the delays were caused by the Department itself    It is entirely unfair that the State Department is requiring expedition fees to speed up delays of their own making   Families should not be faced with inexcusable delays and hefty fees as a result of the Departments own failings  Senator Clinton said     A copy of the letter sent by Senator Clinton and her colleagues follows    June 15  2007   The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  2201 C Street  NW  Washington  DC 20520   Dear Secretary Rice    We write to express serious concerns with delays in processing passport applications that are seriously complicating  and in some cases forcing the cancellation of  travel abroad    In recent weeks  significant and increasing numbers of our constituents have contacted us for help in receiving passports due to long processing delays that threaten imminent travel plans   These travelers applied for passports well in advance of their planned travel   However  due to the large volume of passport requests associated with the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   they are not receiving completed passports sufficiently in advance of their planned departure dates to complete planning for their travels   In an unfortunate and rising number of these cases  our constituents have not received their passports in time  forcing them to cancel long held travel plans and or incur significant expenses to change their plans     It is our understanding that the there are now more than 2 million passport applications pending   In fact  passport office staff are so overwhelmed that they are unable to respond to routine status requests  and have asked that inquiries be e mailed with the planned departure date in the subject line  since they are only able to work on the most urgent requests  those closest to the planned departure date   This virtually ensures that many travelers will receive their passports only at the last minute  making it impossible to make informed decisions on whether to stick with the planned itinerary  and risk having to cancel if the passport does not arrive  or to postpone the planned departure  and incur steep fees for changing the itinerary        To add insult to injury  we have recently been asked to provide constituents credit card numbers when making inquiries on their behalf  because your Department intends to charge them for expediting passport processing and for sending them their passports via Federal Express   Neither charge would be necessary if your Department were processing the original applications in a timely manner   It seems grossly unfair to charge American taxpayers extra for remedying problems that were caused by the government itself    We are not in any way casting blame on the front line employees of your agency who process passport applications   It has been our experience that they have been working long and hard to ensure that travelers receive their passports prior to planned departures   However  it is clear that they are simply overwhelmed by the sheer volume of applications resulting from the implementation of the air and ship passenger provisions of the WHTI    It is unacceptable that American citizens are missing trips because your Department did not anticipate the increase in passport applications and take appropriate action to increase processing resources   Consequently  we ask that you take the following actions    1  immediately cease to charge unwarranted expedition and delivery fees for passports    2  immediately develop and implement a plan to eliminate the current backlog in passport applications and restore normal  pre WHTI processing times  and   3  share with us your plans to ensure that a similar problem does not occur when the land border provisions of the WHTI requirements take effect  including any additional statutory authority or resources that your Department requires    Thank you for your prompt attention to this important issue    Sincerely
