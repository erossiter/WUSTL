September 12  2006 Senator Clinton Joins Bi Partisan Group of Senators to Call on Bush to Help Stop the Violence in Darfur                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  along with a bipartisan group of senators  sent a letter to President Bush identifying several specific steps that should be taken immediately to stem the escalating conflict in Darfur   Today  s letter calls for urgent enforcement of U N  Security Council Resolutions that have authorized deployment of U N  peacekeepers to Darfur  established a no fly zone over Darfur  and enabled sanctions against Sudanese leaders and against the Sudanese petroleum sector  The letter also repeats a call from Congress for President Bush to appoint a Special Envoy for Sudan            The world is now well aware of the Sudanese military offensive in Darfur  International officials have made clear in the starkest terms that three million people in Darfur now stand on the edge of absolute destruction  The Government of Sudan should know that it will be held accountable  both individually and collectively  for continued violations of international law  Violence against civilians must end immediately     said Senator Clinton          This letter comes in the wake of Senate approval for an additional  20 million to aid the African Union Mission in Sudan   The funding was included as an amendment Senator Clinton co sponsored to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill   Senator Clinton is also an original co sponsor of a Senate resolution introduced last week that calls on the President to take immediate action to help stop the violence in Darfur       The full text of today  s letter to President Bush follows       The President  The White House  Washington  DC   20500      Dear Mr  President       We write to urge you to take decisive action immediately to address the disaster looming in Darfur            As you know  Khartoum has rejected U N  Security Council Resolution 1706  which calls for the deployment of U N  peacekeepers to Darfur   Meanwhile  government forces have launched a major military offensive in Darfur  and other armed groups continue their attacks  in direct violation of the Darfur Peace Agreement and the N  Djamena cease fire accord   As a result  over fifty thousand civilians have been forcibly displaced  and nearly half a million are beyond the reach of humanitarian aid          The Sudanese government appears to be making an all out push to finish the job of ethnic cleansing in Darfur   Though it seems to have backed off its threat to expel the African Union force  it has garnered the support of the Arab League for Khartoum  s plans to deploy troops to Darfur   Human rights groups have pointed out that civilians  millions of whom are concentrated in IDP camps  are vulnerable to attack  including indiscriminant aerial bombardment   In short  this is a moment very much like the one the world faced just before the genocide in Rwanda in 1994 and the massacre in Srebrenica in 1995   Strong action by the United States and its international partners is required in the coming hours and days    not weeks    to avert an even larger tragedy          You have worked hard to keep Darfur on the international community  s agenda  as reflected most recently by the passage on August 31st of U N  Security Council Resolution 1706   However  Khartoum has undermined your efforts at every turn   We therefore urge you to take the following additional steps          Publicly reject  in coordination with our allies  Khartoum  s demand that the AU leave and insist that the only way to restore security is through the deployment of a U N  peacekeeping force in accordance with Resolution 1706          Impose targeted financial  travel  and diplomatic sanctions against the Sudanese leadership  rebel forces  and others determined to be responsible for the atrocities and pursue the immediate imposition of similar sanctions by the U N  Security Council and the European Union as called for by UNSC resolutions 1556 and 1564   It is high time for such an action to be taken by the Security Council  and if the Council cannot act because of threats of a Russian or Chinese veto  by the United States and Europe acting together          Urge the Security Council to establish a no fly zone to enforce its previous call  in Resolution 1591  for the government of Sudan to cease offensive military flights over Darfur   If the Security Council does not act  the United States should work with its NATO allies to enforce a no fly zone on our own          Take active steps to secure support from member states for the United Nations Human Rights Council to convene a special session on Sudan           Implement an inclusive dialogue amongst the people of Darfur to give them a role and interest in shaping a durable peace            Increase diplomatic pressure on Russia  China  and the Arab League to convince them to use their influence with Khartoum to accept a U N  peacekeeping force          Urge all U N  member states to accelerate implementation of Security Council Resolution 1706 and the deployment of U N  peacekeepers to Darfur  to provide additional personnel  equipment  financial  and logistical support to AMIS  and to adhere to all relevant U N  Security Council Resolutions          Provide Congress with an accurate assessment of funding shortfalls in peacekeeping needs for both the immediate support to the African Union as called for in U N  Security Council Resolution 1706  and for the transition and maintenance of the new U N  force in Darfur            Reiterate to the government of Sudan  rebel groups  and all parties in Darfur that U N  Security Council Resolution 1706 demands accountability for war crimes in Darfur            In addition  we ask again that you designate a Special Envoy to Sudan to head the Office of the Presidential Special Envoy established pursuant to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2006  P L  109 234    The previous special envoy to Sudan  former Senator Jack Danforth  played a critical role in negotiating an end to the 22 year war between Khartoum and Southern Sudanese rebels   Another envoy of similar stature and capability could build on the work of your administration          Mr  President  tens of thousands of lives may hang in the balance   We are committed to working to support your efforts to address this urgent matter
