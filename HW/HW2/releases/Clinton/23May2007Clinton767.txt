May 23  2007 Senator Clinton Expresses Serious Concern Over Cuts to Funding for New York City  Nassau  Suffolk and Dutchess Counties  HIV AIDS Programs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Recent Decision by Department of Health and Human Services May Mean Over  9 Million in Cuts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today reacted with serious concern to reports of Ryan White program funding cuts to New York localities  writing to Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Michael Leavitt  looking for answers about how the decisions were made and what steps the department will take to help local organizations deal with the potentially serious impact of the devastating cuts  The Health Resources and Services Administration at HHS recently notified New York City  Nassau  Suffolk and Dutchess Counties that they would experience over  9 million in cuts in Title I awards  jeopardizing the ability of these governments to maintain currently existing care and support programs for people living with HIV and AIDS           I am dismayed and disappointed by today s announcement of Title I supplemental awards  which will result in millions of dollars of cuts to New York City and Nassau  Suffolk and Dutchess Counties  Counties rely on this Title I locality based funding to provide services to people living with HIV and AIDS  and these cuts will jeopardize the ability of providers across New York State to maintain current levels of care and support services   Senator Clinton said   I have written to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to try to get some answers about how this came to pass and how they intend to mitigate the impact of these losses to New York  I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that the Ryan White program has adequate funding to address the needs of all Americans living with HIV and AIDS           Through Title I of the Ryan White CARE Act  funding is provided to local governments in areas that have been greatly impacted by the AIDS epidemic  In New York  Title I funding is provided to New York City  Nassau  Suffolk and Dutchess Counties  Earlier this year  following announcements of cuts to New York State  Senator Clinton wrote to Secretary Leavitt asking him to give priority to these Title I entities for supplemental funding  The reauthorization of the CARE Act advises that priority for supplemental funding be given to areas where a decline in funding would negatively impact the ability of those areas to adequately provide services to those living with HIV and AIDS           Senator Clinton has long been a champion of ensuring adequate care and treatment of people living with HIV AIDS  The Senator has fought repeatedly to ensure that New York receives adequate funding under the CARE Act  In February  Senators Clinton and Schumer wrote to Secretary Leavitt to urge that anticipated cuts in formula grants to Nassau and Suffolk counties be restored  Last month  their hard work was partially rewarded when HHS granted a waiver to this area allowing them to continue funding critically important supportive services for people living with HIV and AIDS  Last year  Senator Clinton and her colleagues in New York and New Jersey were instrumental in ensuring that the reauthorization of the Ryan White Act eliminate proposed drastic cuts of nearly  100 million for both New Jersey and New York  Earlier this year  she reintroduced the Early Treatment for HIV Act with Senator Gordon Smith  which would enable states to provide Medicaid coverage to low income individuals living with HIV before they become sick          The full text of Senator Clinton s letter to Secretary Leavitt follows          May 23  2007  The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary  United States Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  D C  20201      Dear Mr  Secretary       I am dismayed and disappointed by today s announcement of Title I supplemental awards  which will result in millions of dollars of cuts to New York City and Nassau  Suffolk and Dutchess Counties   These entities rely on Title I locality based funding to provide services to people living with HIV and AIDS  and these cuts will jeopardize the ability of providers across New York State to maintain current levels of care and support services           New York State has already suffered millions of dollars in cuts to its Title II state level funding  and earlier this year I wrote to you asking that you take such losses into consideration when making the supplemental grant awards for locality funding  which were announced today  According to the recently passed reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act  priority in receiving supplemental funding   the type of funding announced earlier this week   should be given to areas where a decline in formula funding will impact the ability of areas to provide services to people living with HIV and AIDS  a situation which clearly exists in New York  However  you  not only did not reply to that letter  but you failed to take into account the funding cuts already experienced by New York when you awarded these supplemental funds           New York City is the epicenter of the HIV AIDS epidemic in the United States  with more than 95 000 individuals living with HIV and AIDS   The grantees in Nassau  Suffolk and Dutchess Counties also have clear need  with more than 5 000 individuals living with HIV and AIDS in these areas   It remains unclear why  in areas that are experiencing such an impact from the epidemic  these grantees would overall experience more than  9 million in losses   losses that will certainly impact the ability of these regions and our state to maintain the standard of care and level of services that are currently being provided   I am already hearing from providers across the state about how they are being forced to cut back on services due to limitations in funding  and the cuts announced today will only exacerbate that situation           I would like you to address the following questions          1  Were any of the New York Title I entities given priority status for supplemental funding  as per the intent of the legislation  If not  what were the reasons for failing to extend priority status to these entities          2  Given the extent of need in New York  as evidenced not only by the number of individuals living with HIV and AIDS  but also factors such as homelessness and poverty  why were these supplemental funds cut  resulting in overall Title I awards that were less than those awarded in previous years          3  Will you use your authority to help provide assistance to entities that may have to reduce services as a result of these cuts  If not  why not          I am prepared to work with you to obtain additional funding for these programs in the appropriations process  and expect to receive a response to these questions as soon as possible          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
