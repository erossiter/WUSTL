October 11  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations regarding the Iran Holocaust conference                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       As you gather today to decry the hateful and inciteful actions of the Iranian government  I join my voice with yours   As we know too well  The President of Iran has made a series of incendiary  outrageous comments  questioning the Holocaust and calling for Israel to be wiped off the map   These hateful statements  which are beyond the pale of international discourse and acceptability  are drawing condemnation from around the world   We must not treat them as business as usual   These words were spoken not only by the leader of a United Nations member state  but by the President of a country that has raised serious international concerns over its nuclear ambitions   And this week s conference calling into question the Holocaust is yet another mark against the credibility of this regime   Leaders from all over the world should condemn this conference            To deny the Holocaust places the President of Iran in company with the most despicable bigots and historical revisionists  It is an insult not only to the memory of the millions of Jews who suffered and died in the Shoah  but also to the troops of the United States and its allies who  in the fight to liberate Europe from Nazism  bore witness to the reality of the Holocaust   Such comments only add greater urgency to the necessity of denying nuclear weapons to Iran   A nuclear Iran is a danger to Israel  to its neighbors and beyond   The regime s pro terrorist  anti American and anti Israel rhetoric only underscores the urgency of the threat it poses   United States policy must be clear and unequivocal   We cannot and should not   must not   permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons                  Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Israel and the Middle East
