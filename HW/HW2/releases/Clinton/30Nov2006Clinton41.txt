less than our utmost respect     Senator Clinton said            I am calling on the Department of the Army to immediately begin an investigation of this episode  The Pentagon and the Army must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the returning remains of soldiers are treated with the respect that they deserve                Reports published earlier this week indicate that airport

       I urge you to immediately begin an investigation of this episode  to determine whether these upsetting allegations are true and to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the returning remains of soldiers are treated with the respect that they deserve   I also ask that you clarify the Army  s policy and established procedures regarding the transport home of the remains of service

arriving             Our men and women in uniform are the best that our nation has to offer   Those who make the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our nation deserve our deepest appreciation and
