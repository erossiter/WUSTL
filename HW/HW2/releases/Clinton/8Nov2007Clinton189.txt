November 8  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be our nations next Attorney General is a matter of tremendous consequence for all Americans   We urgently need an Attorney General who will defend our Constitution and the rule of law  whose loyalties lie with the American people and the evenhanded and impartial enforcement of our laws and not with any political party or ideology   We need a leader who will direct the embattled Department of Justice in the struggle to protect our country from terrorists and do so while also respecting Americans civil liberties   And we need an Attorney General who categorically renounces torture and believes no one  not even the President  is above the law  Judge Mukasey was given ample opportunity during his testimony and his written submissions to clearly state his views on torture and unchecked Executive power and to disavow deeply troubling practices that threaten Americans most fundamental freedoms and liberties and that fail to reflect our national values   Unfortunately  Judge Mukaseys answers left me unconvinced that he is up to the task of fulfilling these important obligations  and therefore he has left me with no choice but to oppose his nomination   Because I expect Judge Mukasey to be confirmed  I hope that he heeds the serious concerns expressed by me and my colleagues and becomes the kind of Attorney General he has pledged to be
