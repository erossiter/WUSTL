August 3  2006 Senator Clinton Introduces Bill to Provide Low Income Families with Options for Meeting Infant Care Needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today introduced legislation to help address the chronic shortage of infant child care for low income families by giving parents eligible for subsidized infant care the option of using that subsidy to provide at home care themselves   Senator Clinton  s bill would establish a demonstration program in five to seven states to test this model   Representative Rosa DeLauro  D CT  has introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives              This program would give America  s working families choices and the help they need to balance work and child care for their infants     said Senator Clinton            This flexibility would ease the burden of unmet need in child care programs   Today supply meets just 18 percent of the need for licensed child care slots for infants   Shortages are particularly acute in rural areas and  especially  in rural areas with many low income residents   The Republican Congress has not kept the promise it made in passing the welfare reform law in 1996 to provide increased federal funding for child care services   Coupled with state cutbacks  working families have been left with few options for infant care           Studies have shown that the quality of care taking in the first months and years of life is critical to a newborn  s brain development  social development and well being   The critical shortage of infant child care for low income families could be met by allowing parents to provide the much needed care themselves   However  without a subsidy  for most low income families it is not financially viable for a parent to quit his or her job or to reduce work hours to care for an infant   The Choices in Child Care Act will allow qualified low  and moderate income parents the option of receiving a comparable stipend to provide safe and quality care for their infant while keeping the family economically stable            This option would be available to working families that meet the income eligibility requirements   Families could not receive more than the amount their state pays licensed child care providers to care full time for one infant           Senator Clinton  s bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to evaluate the Choices in Child Care Program within the first four years after the program begins
