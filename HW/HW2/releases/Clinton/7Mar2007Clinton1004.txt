                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   On the 42nd anniversary to the day of Bloody Sunday  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones  D OH  today announced that they are reintroducing in both chambers of Congress comprehensive voting reform legislation that demands an electoral system that not only ensures that every voter is given the opportunity to cast a vote  but also instills in every voter the confidence that his or her vote has been counted   Senator Clinton and Representative Tubbs Jones announced the action today in a press conference joined by co sponsors Senator Barbara Boxer  D CA  and Representative John Lewis  D GA  and voting rights advocates  including Ralph G  Neas  President of People For the American Way  Hilary Shelton  Director of the Washington Office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People  NAACP   Barbara Arnwine  the Executive Director of the Lawyers  Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and Wendy Weiser  Deputy Director  the Brennan Center for Justice           Voting is the most precious right of every U S  citizen  and we have a moral obligation to ensure the integrity of our elections   We cannot rest until we have done everything we can to make sure that voters have confidence in our voting system and exercise their right to vote   We must be able to easily and accurately count every vote so that every vote counts   said Senator Clinton           I am pleased to once again join with Senator Clinton in introducing companion legislation in the House as we continue our efforts to ensure that every American is afforded their Constitutional right to vote   said Representative Tubbs Jones    Considering the tremendous election discrepancies that we have seen take place in this country  including this past mid term election  we know that we are still dealing with a flawed system  The passage of this legislation is paramount to ensuring that people throughout this country are not disenfranchised when they attempt to exercise their right to vote            It was exactly 42 years ago today that Hosea Williams and I led a march of 600 peaceful protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma  Alabama   Many of them gave a little blood on that bridge for the cause of voting rights in America   It is because of those brave individuals that I and so many others hold seats in Congress today   We have come a great distance  but we still live in an America where some votes are nullified  discounted  and disregarded  and where some communities are systematically disenfranchised from full participation in the democratic process   We need this comprehensive voting reform to help continue the work that those marchers and so many others throughout our history sacrificed to build  a more free  more fair democratic society   said Representative Lewis          The Count Every Vote Act will provide a voter verified paper record for every vote cast in electronic voting machines and ensures access to voter verification for all citizens  including language minority voters  illiterate voters and voters with disabilities  The bill mandates that this ballot be the official ballot for purposes of a recount   The bill sets a uniform standard for provisional ballots so that every qualified voter will know their votes are treated equally  and requires the Federal Election Assistance Commission to issue standards that ensure uniform access to voting machines and trained election personnel in every community  The bill also improves security measures for electronic voting machines           To ensure that citizens have the ability to vote in a timely and efficient manner  the Count Every Vote Act requires states to work to reduce wait times for voters at polling places   It also designates Election Day a federal holiday and requires early voting in each state in order to encourage more citizens to exercise their right to vote  The bill also enacts  no excuse  absentee balloting  enacts fair and uniform voter registration and identification  and requires states to allow citizens to register to vote on Election Day    In addition  the legislation restores voting rights for ex offenders who have repaid their debt to society           The Count Every Vote Act also includes measures to protect voters from the conflicts of interest and deceptive practices that lead to the disenfranchisement of voters and harm voter trust in the integrity of the system  In particular  the bill prohibits chief state election officials as well as owners and executives of voting machine manufacturers from serving in any position on the political campaign committee of a candidate or engaging in other kinds of partisan campaign activities   The bill also makes it a federal crime to commit deceptive practices  such as sending flyers into minority neighborhoods telling voters the wrong voting date  and makes these practices a felony punishable by up to five years of imprisonment           The legislation is supported by People For the American Way  Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law  the NAACP  Common Cause  U S  PIRG and the Brennan Center for Justice   At today s press conference  representatives from civil rights organizations emphasized the urgent need to pass the Count Every Vote Act             The need for election reform is clear   said Ralph G  Neas  President of People For the American Way and People For the American Way Foundation    Every Republican  Democrat and Independent deserves the right to vote without unnecessary barriers to the ballot box  and with the confidence that each vote will be counted   Unfortunately  our current election system fails to live up to that basic promise   That s why this legislation is so important            The vote is the heart of democracy  Today there are too many barriers to citizens registering  voting and knowing their vote will count  This legislation would make a major stride toward fixing our broken election system and restoring democracy s promise  Our research and litigation shows these are just the steps that are needed   said Michael Waldman  Executive Director of the Brennan Center for Justice           Barbara R  Arnwine  Executive Director of the Lawyers  Committee said   The Count Every Vote Act responds to the hundreds of thousands of American voters who called the 1 866 OUR VOTE voter services hotline reporting the real problems that lead to disenfranchisement across the country   Unfortunately  too many voters are needlessly blocked from exercising their fundamental right to vote by defects in an unresponsive and insufficient election administration system   I commend the co sponsors for looking beyond partisanship and putting the fundamental rights of all American voters first           Senator Clinton and Representative Tubbs Jones first introduced the Count Every Vote Act in the 109th Congress along with colleagues in both chambers   They will continue to work this Congress to address the unfinished business of election reform   Co sponsors of the Count Every Vote Act include Senators Barbara Boxer  D CA   Barbara Mikulski  D MD   Patrick Leahy  D VT   John Kerry  D MA  and Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  and Representative John Lewis  D GA
