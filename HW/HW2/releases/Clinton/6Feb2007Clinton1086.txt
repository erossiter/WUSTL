February 6  2007 Senator Clinton Raises Iraq and Darfur with Defense Secretary Gates and General Pace  Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff  at a Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on the Administration s FY 08 Department of Defense Budget Request                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator Clinton   Thank you very much for your service and your patience and I m grateful to each and every one of you for the work you do            It seems to me  Mr  Chairman that we have a number of extremely important issues before the committee that have been highlighted by various members   We have the budget  which is going to deserve and need a lot more scrutiny  We ve heard a lot of talk about the percentage of GDP it is in comparison to the percentage of GDP in other wars and conflicts   I might also add the taxation rates were considerably different during those conflicts as well   We are not paying for the military that we want nor are we paying adequately for the global war on terrorism  So this budget is going to have to be scrutinized  but we re going to be faced with the dilemma of whether we are adequately funding our troops and whether we will pay for adequately funding our troops            Secondly  we continue to have questions about how we ensure American troops are trained and equipped  something that I ve raised in a series of our hearings with General Petraeus  Admiral Fallon and others  General Casey most recently  and I think you can hear Secretary Gates  we re still not satisfied   Both you and General Pace have responded to questions  starting with the Chairman s from the very beginning of this hearing  but there remains a considerable amount of anecdotal evidence about shortages  And I will be reading the Inspector General s Report later this afternoon  but from the reports that we have received  it appears that there was a lack of corporation  perhaps with appropriate officials in DOD and the chain of command  and trying to get to the bottom of whether or not we have adequate training and equipping of our troops  So this will continue to be an issue that I and others will pursue            We also have heard about the need to enlist the entire government to participate effectively in the War on Terrorism and  as Senator Warner has said  I remember when he was on the floor introducing his bill and speaking about it  we actually have made a stab at this   I think it s fair to say none of us are either fully aware of or satisfied with what direction it has taken us and I think Senator Sessions suggestions are really serious ones and should be carefully considered by the Administration   We also  yes Sir       Senator Warner   Senator  if you d yield  I have here the reference to the legislation  and you co sponsored that legislation together with Senator Lugar and myself          Senator Clinton  Yes I did   That s exactly right  And we did under Senator Warner s leadership  passed that legislation  but it s clear that none of us has a handle on what  if anything has been done to implement it  So we really do wish to have some additional information and feed back on that            We ve also begun to examine  and I appreciate very much Senator McCaskill s lead on this  examine the way our government has outsourced so much of the work of preparing and defending our nation to private contractors  who may be  neither cost effective nor free of conflict   I think this will be a very important issue for this Congress that we will be exploring and again looking for assistance from you            And finally  your words Secretary Gates  How we best incentivize the Iraqi Government  There are those who think that the era of carrots has got to end  That we ve been  in effect  ignored by giving them a blank check and the blood and treasure of our nation  especially the lives of our young men and women and the injured that have come home with such grievous wounds and we don t believe that is an effective way to get their attention   This part of the world  which you have studied   you re certainly part of the Iraq Study Group before being asked to be Secretary of Defense  you know very well    I m not sure carrots are part of the diet  So I think that many of us have been searching for more effective ways that can get the attention  not only of the nominal Iraqi Government  but of the sources that support it  And to that end  in addition to our concerns about the attack on Karbala and what that meant  and I appreciate General Pace referencing the likelihood that it was well organized insurgents  which I translate to be Sunni elements   We also are concerned about the Madi Army Militia obtaining not only trained men  who we have trained  but also equipment   A recent article on February 2  McClatchy Newspapers entitled   Madi Army Gains Strength Through Unwitting Aid of US  The US Military Drive to Train and Equip Iraq Security Forces has Unwittingly Strengthened Sadr and His Militia    So  these are deep concerns to us and we don t believe that we  at least speaking for myself  see much change in the testimony we hear  in the plans that are being implemented as to how we re going to get a handle on these very serious challenges           But Mr  Secretary  I want to change direction just somewhat abruptly  because I want to ask you about a letter that on January 16  I and along with 21 of my colleagues  including several members of this committee  sent to President Bush asking for an explanation of what  Plan B  steps he was considering with respect to Darfur  including possible punitive military action  such as a no fly zone or blockade of Port Sudan  Obviously  we are facing  once again  the repeated and blatant violations of numerous cease fire peace agreements and UN obligations by the Government of President Bashir   It is worth noting  I think  that this does not need to be a no fly zone on the scale of what we formally ran over Iraq  but could be accomplished with a significantly smaller outlay of resources by directing punitive strikes against Sudanese planes known to have taken part in illegal bombing missions in Darfur   I ve made this suggestion on several occasions to our NATO Commander in the past  and to others within the Administration  and I d like to ask you if you have been instructed by the President to begin planning or preparing any such measure and whether or not you would look into that if you have not yet been asked to do so         Secretary Gates   I have not been asked to  I would defer to General Pace in terms of whether the Joint Chiefs have done any contingency planning along those lines and I m certainly willing to pursue it       Senator Clinton  General Pace       General Pace  I have not been asked to do that  Ma am       Senator Clinton   Well  I think that obviously from the perspective of many of us  the ongoing genocide in Darfur and the blatant refusal by the Sudanese government to act has been deeply concerning   We have about seven thousand African Union troops there   They are the sole line of defense for the hundreds of thousands civilians facing genocide   Twenty million dollars was included in the  07 Defense Appropriations bill to provide assistance to these troops   They are obliviously woefully under funded  they don t have logistic support  they have no airlift capacity   I understand that the State Department  which has been administering all US funding going to the African Union troops  has requested that this new  20 million be transferred to them   Is your office considering that request and do you have an opinion  as the Secretary of Defense  whether that meets our desire having put this in the Department of Defense Appropriations rather than State Department Appropriations         Secretary Gates   This is the first I ve heard it Senator   I ll have to look into it       Senator Clinton   Thank you  And finally Mr  Secretary  the FY  07 Defense Appropriation bill contains a provision I sponsored requiring the Department of Defense to submit a detailed report on the Department s role in assisting the parties to implement the Darfur Peace Agreement of May 5  2006   The report is envisioned to contain information on issues of critical importance to stabilizing Darfur  such as an assessment of assets that the US Military and NATO are able offer the African Union mission in Sudan and any efforts made by the Department of Defense to leverage troop contributions from other countries to serve in the proposed hybrid AU UN peace keeping mission for Darfur   This report was supposed to be available no later than January 15  2007  that was 90 days after enactment of the bill  as of October 17  2006   May I ask you Mr  Secretary  if you know the status of this report       Secretary Gates   No Ma am  but I ll find out       Senator Clinton   And I would appreciate it being promptly delivered to me and to this committee   Thank you very much
