April 2  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  on the Passing of Pope John Paul II                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I am profoundly saddened to learn of the passing of His Holiness Pope John Paul II   I was honored to have met with His Holiness several times while I was First Lady and I will cherish those visits always           John Paul II  s authority as a force for democracy  tolerance  and forgiveness around the world flowed not from his title  but from the man who bore it  his unmatched intellect  his infinite heart  and his boundless faith carried forth his message of love and hope through even the bleakest of circumstances and the darkest of days            Like so many millions of others  I learned from his example that faith  and the courage it fosters  can empower each of us to confront life  s challenges   Whether fighting intolerance and oppression  or publicly bearing the suffering of illness and age  John Paul II stood always with spiritual firmness and grace            Pope John Paul II  s work on Earth is done  and he is returned to a God whom he loved and served with all his might   He leaves behind a world that is more tolerant and more hopeful for the bequest of his remarkable life
