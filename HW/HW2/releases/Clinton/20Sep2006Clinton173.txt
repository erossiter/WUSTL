September 20  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clintonon the Nomination of Dr  Andrew von Eschenbach to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration Senate HELP Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Thank you  Chairman Enzi and Senator Kennedy          We have made a lot of progress since the last time we convened on Dr  von Eschenbach  s nomination  On August 24th  after nearly three long years  FDA made a long overdue decision on Plan B  marking a victory for women s health and for the American people who had been waiting for years for the FDA to make a decision  yes or no  on Plan B  s over the counter application          While I urge the FDA to revisit placing age restrictions on the sale of Plan B since its own scientific advisory panel found it safe and effective for people under 18  it is a real step forward that millions of American women will now have increased access to emergency contraception           The FDA finally acting was about more than Plan B    it was an important first step toward restoring the American people  s faith in the FDA   It was important sign that the agency will return to its mission of putting science ahead of ideology          This is a significant step forward that will help improve women s health and prevent unintended pregnancies          As I told Dr  von Eschenbach at his hearing on August 1st  his qualifications were never related to my and Senator Murray  s hold on his nomination   As promised  Senator Murray and I lifted our hold following the FDA  s decision on Plan B and today I vote in support of Dr  von Eschenbach  s nomination          With permanent leadership at the FDA  I hope that we can turn our attention to fully addressing some of the challenges that face our public health sector  such as our continued concerns over drug safety  the availability of generics pharmaceuticals  the need to expand pediatric treatment options  and the importance of recognizing and addressing food safety hazards in a timely manner           The American people deserve an FDA that is the gold standard in drug approval   I look forward to working with Dr  von Eschenbach and hope that he will provide the strong scientific leadership that is needed at the helm of this critical agency
