January 11  2005 Senator Clinton Asks United Hospital  to Meet Community Needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a letter to New York United Hospital Medical Center CEO  Philip Dionne  asking him to reconsider the decision to close the hospital  The 224 bed hospital and 70 bed skilled nursing facility employs more than 600 local residents  many of whom live in an apartment building that also sits on the 14 acre United Hospital campus        In her letter to the United Hospital Medical Center  Senator Clinton said         While closing this hospital could jeopardize access to care for local residents  it could also have severe negative consequences for the local economy  I am deeply concerned about the more than 600 local residents who will lose their jobs  almost one quarter of which live in apartments on the hospital campus  which will also be lost  The consequences for these families are particularly acute and should be a top priority as we work to resolve this crisis        I am also concerned about the impact closing United Hospital will have on the remaining hospital infrastructure  Local hospitals are facing increasing wait times in their emergency rooms and growing financial pressures  which coupled with the recent closing of St  Agnes Hospital  will only be heightened by the closing of United Hospital        I am committed to working to ensure that the people of Port Chester and the surrounding areas continue to have access to high quality hospital services  and that the livelihoods and housing of United Hospital s workers are a top priority in any solution
