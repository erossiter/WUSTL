                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is continuing to press Postmaster General John Potter to keep issuing the Purple Heart Stamp honoring the heroes who have received this medal   Senator Clinton has launched a petition inviting those who agree with the effort to save the Purple Heart Stamp to add their name to her letter  posted on her website at http   www clinton senate gov   In a letter to the Postmaster General  Senator Clinton delivered a list of over 750 names of individuals who have signed onto her petition  Senator Clinton also expressed her hope of speaking personally with the Postmaster General to discuss the importance of maintaining the Purple Heart stamp          As you can see  the petition has struck a deep chord and has drawn very strong support from those who have a special place in their heart for the Purple Heart stamp and all it represents     wrote Senator Clinton     I am certain you agree that it is important that we properly honor these veterans who have sacrificed for our nation   There are over 1 535 000 recipients of the Purple Heart Medal  approximately 550 000 of whom are still living         Senator Clinton has been an unwavering champion in the fight to recognize the heroism of those who have received the Purple Heart   Senator Clinton cosponsored legislation  S  Con  Res  56  during the 107th Congress expressing the sense of Congress that a commemorative postage stamp should be issued to honor members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Purple Heart   Senator Clinton wrote to the U S  Postmaster General urging support for a commemorative stamp to pay tribute to the Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit  And in May 2003  Senator Clinton attended the ceremony to launch the first issue of the Purple Heart Stamp in Newburgh  NY   The Senate also has approved legislation  sponsored by Senator Clinton and Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE   supporting a   National Purple Heart Recognition Day    and honoring all soldiers who were severely injured while serving their country and who were awarded a Purple Heart          The Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit  commonly known as the Purple Heart  is the oldest military decoration in the world in present use  The Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the President of the United States to members of the Armed Forces who are wounded in conflict with an enemy force  or while held by an enemy force as a prisoner of war  and posthumously to the next of kin of members of the Armed Forces who are killed in conflict with an enemy force  or who die of a wound received in conflict with an enemy force         The Purple Heart was established on August 7  1782 during the Revolutionary War  when General George Washington issued an order establishing the Honorary Badge of Distinction  otherwise known as the Badge of Military Merit  or the Decoration of the Purple Heart         The text of Senator Clinton s letter follows          The Honorable John E  Potter  Postmaster General  United States Postal Service  475 L Enfant Plaza  S W   Room 10022  Washington  D C   20260       Dear Mr  Postmaster General        I write to follow up on the letter I sent earlier this month urging you to ensure that the Purple Heart stamp continues to be issued for years to come   As I mentioned in my previous letter  the Military Order of the Purple Heart of the U S A   MOPH  has informed my staff that it understands the stamp will be discontinued in 2006 because of a projected rate rise for stamps   I understand that the National Commander and National Adjutant of the MOPH have contacted you directly to advocate continuing the stamp  and I am certain that they are eager to learn whether this request will be granted      There are many others who are also awaiting official word from the United States Postal Service   At the same time that I wrote to you  I began an online petition inviting those who agree with the effort to save the Purple Heart Stamp to add their name on my website at http   www clinton senate gov   Enclosed are the names of more than 750 individuals who have signed the petition so far      As you can see  the petition has struck a deep chord and has drawn very strong support from those who have a special place in their heart for the Purple Heart stamp and all it represents   I am certain you agree that it is important that we properly honor these veterans who have sacrificed for our nation   There are over 1 535 000 recipients of the Purple Heart Medal  approximately 550 000 of whom are still living      This is an important and timely issue   With the New Year and projected rate rise approaching  I believe it is critical for us to discuss the issue directly  so that I may explain personally why I am urging your support and approval for continuing to issue an official Purple Heart stamp for years to come        Thank you for your consideration of this request  I look forward to your response      Sincerely yours                Hillary Rodham Clinton
