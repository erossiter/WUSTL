July 27  2006 In the Wake of Last Month  s Devastating Floods  Senator Clinton Calls on Senate and FEMA to Examine the Possibility of Changes to Disaster Assistance Funding for Individuals and Small Businesses                                                                                                                                                                                                               Senator also calls on FEMA to help local communities update floodplain maps                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    In the aftermath of the June floods that devastated parts of Upstate New York  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on her Senate colleagues  FEMA and other officials to consider whether to amend existing law so that small businesses impacted by such disasters might in future be eligible for direct assistance  At a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee today on changes to the Robert T  Stafford Act  Senator Clinton said that many small businesses may need more than low interest loans in the wake of disasters            In recent months it has become very clear that there is a very real and growing concern about the type and level of assistance that the federal government is able to provide  especially to small businesses  following major disasters  Analyzing changes to the Stafford Act requires us to look at the way we provide assistance to small business owners in the aftermath of such devastation and in the face of such tremendous losses     Senator Clinton said  following the hearing            Under the present system  when small businesses face losses due to a disaster  we offer them low interest loans  But many people who own small businesses simply cannot afford to take on any more loans especially after they have just lost their homes and all of their possessions     Senator Clinton said    It is time that we look at changing the way we give assistance to small businesses after major disasters  We must find a system that works for everyone in their time of greatest need             The Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  the Stafford Act  authorizes the President to issue major disaster and emergency declarations  which in turn enables several federal agencies to provide assistance to states overwhelmed by disasters  Stafford Act assistance is provided through funds appropriated to the Disaster Relief Fund  DRF   Federal assistance supported by DRF money is used by states  localities  and certain non profit organizations to provide mass care  restore damaged or destroyed facilities  clear debris  and aid individuals and families with uninsured needs  among other activities           The Stafford Act designates the universe of eligible applicants following a disaster  e g   states  local governments  owners of certain private nonprofit facilities  individuals  or families   However  not all persons or entities affected by a catastrophe are eligible for Stafford Act assistance even if the President issues a declaration  FEMA officials determine the need for assistance after a major disaster or emergency declaration is issued  Aid is provided only to those persons or entities determined to need the assistance  For example  a family with adequate insurance and alternative housing options might not be considered eligible to receive financial aid  A unit of local government that suffers damages to some facilities  but not to the extent considered necessary pursuant to FEMA regulations and guidelines  might not receive funds to rebuild infrastructure  Small businesses have to rely on Small Business Administration loans  not Stafford Act grants             Given the number and extent of damage caused by man made and natural disasters  we must consider whether low interest loans for small businesses are adequate to help those businesses that were completely destroyed or damaged and whether the Stafford Act should be amended to authorize the President to provide grants to already struggling small business owners for short and long term recovery     Senator Clinton said          At the hearing today  Senator Clinton also called on FEMA and the other witnesses to help communities update their floodplain maps  Earlier this month  Senator Clinton also supported the inclusion in the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill of  198 98 million in funds for the Flood Map Modernization Fund  The bill will now go into conference with its House counterpart and Senator Clinton has committed to urge conferees to retain the funding through that process            Many of the communities that were devastated by the recent floods had 30 year old floodplain maps which were of no help at all in preparing for and dealing with the rains when they came     Senator Clinton said    We must provide communities with updated and accurate flood plans  floodplain maps and data to help them be as coordinated and prepared as possible             At the hearing today  Senator Clinton also raised a number of critical issues with respect to the Stafford Act and its ability to deal with disasters  including               Post disaster medical and mental health tracking  funding  and care especially as it relates to Ground Zero and the continuing health impact on first responders  volunteers  and other workers           The President  s ability to preposition assets and declare major disaster areas absent a request from a Governor           FEMA  s ability to manage large scale disasters and getting assistance to individuals in need while avoiding unnecessary waste and asset mismanagement           Eliminating no bid contracting and providing a mechanism for local individuals and companies to receive contracts from FEMA for clean up and rebuilding before large companies are awarded contracts           Appropriate funding levels for mitigation for communities to minimize the impact of certain disasters such as flood map modernization  earthquake proofing buildings  and other measures by coordinating with state and local officials           Coordination problems between state and local governments and FEMA  s existing capabilities  assets  and mission              Mass evacuation plans for New York City and Long Island in the event of a large scale storm or catastrophic event and flooding issues
