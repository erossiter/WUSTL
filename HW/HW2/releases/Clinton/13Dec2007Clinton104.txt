December 13  2007 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Reiterates Call for Action to Prevent Childhood Vaccine Shortages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Calls Recall of Common Vaccine a Wake Up Call for Need to Expand Stockpile of Recommended Vaccines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Following the recall of more than one million doses of a routine childhood vaccine  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today reiterated her call for the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to establish a six month stockpile of critically needed pediatric and adult vaccines   Senator Clinton today reintroduced the Improved Vaccine Supply Act  which would also require vaccine manufacturers to provide no less than one year of notification prior to discontinuing the manufacture of a vaccine to ensure plans are in place for adequate vaccine supply    This recall should be a real wake up call  said Senator Clinton  We need to protect public health and safety by making sure we have an adequate stockpile of routine immunizations     Haemophilus influenzae type b  Hib  vaccine prevents infections caused by the Hib bacteria  which include meningitis  pneumonia  and epiglottis  According to the CDC  Hib used to be the leading cause of bacterial meningitis  impacting more than 20 000 children under the age of five annually  However  since the introduction of the Hib vaccine  cases of invasive Hib disease have been reduced by about 99 percent     The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  estimate that this recall of Hib vaccine will not threaten the health of children  largely because the CDC can draw upon its stockpile of the Hib vaccine to limit shortages while other manufacturers increase their capacity to produce this vaccine  The legislation introduced by Senator Clinton would increase this stockpile  provide additional security for such shortages  and expand essential supplies of a wide variety of immunizations     Senator Clinton has a long history of supporting efforts to ensure that children have access to safe and effective medications and vaccines   Senator Clinton first introduced the Improved Vaccine Supply Act during the 108th Congress in response to previous childhood vaccine shortages   Senator Clinton has also introduced the Influenza Vaccine Security Act with Senator Pat Roberts  which contains provisions that would require the Secretary of HHS to include pediatric treatments for pandemic influenza as part of the Strategic National Stockpile  And earlier this year  portions of Senator Clintons Pediatric Research Improvement Act  which would ensure that drugs marketed for children are safe and effective for pediatric populations  were incorporated into the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act  which was signed into law by the President
