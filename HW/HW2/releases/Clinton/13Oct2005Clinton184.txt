October 13  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Amtrak Board  s Decision to Create Subsidiary to Manage Northeast Corridor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I am extremely concerned about the secretive actions taken by the Amtrak Board of Directors regarding the future of Amtrak and the Northeast Corridor   The Northeast Corridor is a critically important service and the Board s actions are ill advised   A bipartisan group of House and Senate Members have already rejected the President s proposal to bankrupt Amtrak   It would not be in the best interests of the Board to act without consulting all Members of Congress who have a sustained interest in making sure Amtrak works well and to take steps consistent with the will of Congress
