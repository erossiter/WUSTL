May 27  2005 Schumer   Clinton Urge Bush Administration to Reverse Decision to Close Taxpayer Assistance Centers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Closures Would Hurt Low Income New Yorkers  Widen Tax Gap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   Senators Charles Schumer  NY  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today called on Secretary of Treasury John Snow to reverse a Bush administration decision to close seven Taxpayer Assistance Centers in New York  The Senators noted that while the Bush administration s tax cuts have made the tax code even more beneficial to wealthy Americans who can afford to hire accountants  the Administration is shutting down one of the few avenues for free tax assistance available to low income New Yorkers  Schumer and Clinton also emphasized that the closures will contribute to the increasing gap between taxes owed and paid  which already exceeds  300 billion per year          A complicated tax code creates many questions by taxpayers  Low income and middle class New Yorkers will bear the brunt of the Administration s inability to provide the necessary answers to questions they have about paying their taxes  Plain and simple  closing nearly one third of New York s IRS help centers is wrong   said Senator Schumer         This shortsighted decision will only make it harder for many New Yorkers    particularly seniors  low income taxpayers  and those facing language barriers    to receive the face to face assistance and guidance they need to navigate a tax code that is already too complicated   said Senator Clinton        Schumer and Clinton underscored that this plan will contribute to what is already a serious decline in national tax compliance and increasing tax gap  which by the IRS  own estimate exceeds over  300 billion per year in taxes owed  but not collected  Moreover  the comprehensive tax law changes proposed by the Administration over the last four years have exponentially added to the complexity of the tax code          At a time when the Administration should be devoting more resources to tax compliance to reduce the tax gap and to help taxpayers comply with the new complexities of the tax code  it is doing exactly the opposite by closing these tax assistance centers   Schumer and Clinton emphasized        The IRS has announced that seven Taxpayer Assistance Centers in New York will close by this fall  and that 68 total will close across the country  The seven centers are located in Manhattan  Brooklyn  the Bronx  Hauppauge  Kingston  West Nyack and Albany  According to the IRS  81 jobs will be eliminated at these New York centers as a result of the closures         The text of the letter from Senators Schumer and Clinton to Secretary Snow follows        May 27  2005       The Honorable John Snow  Secretary  U S  Department of Treasury  1500 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  D C  20220       Dear Secretary Snow        We are writing to express our deep disappointment at today s announcement by the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  that it is planning to close seven IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers  TAC s  in New York State  We understand the seven sites set to be closed by this fall are located in Brooklyn  Manhattan  the Bronx  Hauppauge  Kingston  West Nyack and Albany  The IRS estimates that 81 positions at these centers will be eliminated as a result of the closures        We are aware of the budgetary pressures the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  faces  and we strongly believe that Congress should provide your department as well as the IRS with the resources to enhance enforcement activities and customer service at the same time that it adds to its capacity to handle other priorities  Indeed  we are encouraged by Commissioner Everson s efforts to crack down on abusive tax shelters as they will go a long way towards ensuring greater compliance  However  at a time when the tax laws enacted over the last several years have made the tax code as complex as ever and when the  tax gap  is well over  300 billion  it is shortsighted to be making cuts to a program designed to help ordinary citizens file their taxes        We believe these cuts in customer service positions are likely to be counterproductive for our constituents  We are concerned that these closures will only make it harder for ordinary New Yorkers to receive essential in person assistance  Commissioner Everson s letter to us states that IRS has  seen a significant shift in the ways Americans interact with the IRS  Compared to the past  fewer taxpayers are choosing to write or call us  even fewer taxpayers are using our walk in TACs  Instead  more and more Americans are using our electronic services  especially our internet site   While we understand that many Americans are increasingly proficient with electronic services  we are very concerned for those who may not have the requisite level of familiarity  knowledge  or economic means to file their taxes without assistance  Those hardest hit by the decision to close the TAC s may be seniors  low income taxpayers  and taxpayers facing language barriers        We appreciate Commissioner Everson s offer to meet with us to discuss the closures further and his letter to us includes an outline of the model used to determine which facilities to close  We would appreciate receiving a briefing and detailed explanation of the model  and how it was applied to by the IRS to select these seven New York sites for closure        Thank you for your attention to this issue and we look forward to your prompt response
