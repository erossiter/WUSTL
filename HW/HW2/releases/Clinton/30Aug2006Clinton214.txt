August 30  2006 Schumer  Clinton  Lautenberg Call for Delay on Vote for Ryan White Funding Until Impact on HIV AIDS Programs in NY  NJ and Across Nation Can be Evaluated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Draft of new funding formula would unjustly punish New York State and New Jersey for accurately reporting HIV AIDS cases and effectively treating patients  New York and New Jersey HIV AIDS patients would lose critical prevention and treatment services      Schumer  Clinton  Lautenberg blast unjust formula and pledge to restore vital funding for New York and New Jersey  s HIV AIDS patients       Washington  DC   Today U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  Hillary Rodham Clinton and Frank Lautenberg called on the leadership of the House and the Senate to allow lawmakers time to analyze the impact of the new language and funding formulas proposed before holding a vote on the bill   The CARE Act  which is short for the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act  authorizes federal money for cities and states to provide health care services for persons living with HIV and AIDS   When this legislation was marked up by the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee earlier this year  the new funding formulas outlined in that version of the bill would result in tens of millions in losses for New York State  which is why Senator Clinton voted against this bill in committee  At that time  the bill  s primary negotiators promised to work with New York  s representatives to address these funding concerns  Yet with the bill likely to be considered by the House in the next few weeks  no draft language or financial impact analysis has yet been released  and New York  s funding issues remain unresolved  The letter was sent in conjunction with Senators Lautenberg and Menendez from New Jersey and Feinstein and Boxer from California  New Jersey  which ranks 5th in the nation with the number of HIV AIDS cases and first in the nation with the percentage of women infected also stands to lose at least  2 million in CARE Act funding under the new funding formula      This proposed funding formula defies reason  New York State has the highest percentage of AIDS and HIV patients in the country and would now being stripped of crucial funding that goes to effective treatment and prevention programs     Schumer said    The new formula would punish us for effectively utilizing money allocated by the original CARE act  We  ve reduced the number of HIV patients who eventually develop AIDS but we still have many patients to treat       It raises great concern to me that New York could lose a significant amount of funding for Ryan White CARE Act programs  Because the support provided by this Act remains such a vital part of New York s system of HIV AIDS treatment and care service  without adequate funding patients seeking care in New York State could face an unnecessary uphill battle to survive   said Senator Clinton    It is critical that New York be given the funding it needs to serve the thousands of individuals living with HIV and AIDS and not risk losing the ability to provide model care           The legislation in its current form may deny medical care and prescription drugs to New Jerseyans with HIV and AIDS  With the fifth highest number of HIV AIDS cases in the nation  and the highest percentage of women with the disease  I can t support this legislation until questions about its effect are answered   Lautenberg said    This legislation should provide the necessary resources to those states with the highest number of HIV AIDS cases    not cut them           New York State bears a disproportionate share of the HIV AIDS epidemic  With just 7 percent of the US population  it has 17 percent of all persons living with AIDS  As of December 2004  almost 110 000 New Yorkers were living with HIV AIDS  with approximately 6 000 new HIV diagnoses each year  In 2004  New York State reported more new AIDS cases and more new HIV cases than in any other state  More that 75 percent of New Yorkers living with HIV AIDS are persons of color    New York State would lose crucial money in part because of a new funding formula in the proposed reauthorization bill   Previously  CARE Act funding was based only on living AIDS cases  but the current formula in this reauthorization includes both HIV and AIDS cases   New York has diligently tracked its HIV cases and has determined that it has 0 56 HIV case for every one AIDS case   Because some states do not have data as accurate as New York  s  in the funding formula these states are given  the benefit of the doubt  and given a much higher estimate of HIV cases   0 9 HIV patients for every one AIDS case   This means that for every 100 AIDS patients in New York  New York will receive funding for 156 HIV and AIDS patients   In a handful of other states  for every 100 AIDS patients the state will receive funding for 190 HIV and AIDS patients  This leads to New York being punished for its own good work  giving it less money for having correctly implemented a new data tracking system and for having strong HIV prevention programs keep new HIV diagnoses lower than other jurisdictions    This one change alone will result in a transfer of  79 million over the next three years from New York to other states    The reauthorization of the CARE Act could diminish the positive force of the CARE Act and deplete resources available for New York  s HIV and AIDS patients  A decrease in funding would likely reduce the State  s ability to provide accessible and quality health care and supportive services for HIV and AIDS patients   In addition  likely reductions in the AIDS Drug Assistance Program  ADAP  funding would result in  either fewer drugs provided to patients  more costs incurred by patients  or a greater burden borne by New York State   ADAP not only covers anti retrovirals that treat the virus directly  but also other drugs that are vital to treat other symptoms of AIDS patients such as  insulin  for diabetics   nutritional support products  and hematology drugs     The Ryan White CARE Act was originally signed into law in 1990  and since 1991 has made federal funding available to both cities and states to provide a number of health care services for HIV and AIDS patients including medical care  drug treatments  dental care  home health care  and outpatient mental health and substance abuse treatment  The CARE Act has played a leading role in improving the health and quality of life for New Yorkers with HIV AIDS  HIV and AIDS patients in New York State rely on Ryan White CARE Act funds to support ADAP  home care programs  the extension of primary care services to the uninsured and community based case management and supportive services programs
