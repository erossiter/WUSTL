been one of the best investments we have made as a nation   Now it is time to update and modernize the GI Bill for the 21st century to meet the needs of today s soldiers  veterans and their families  from education to housing and microloans to start a small business   This is the right way to invest in the future of our servicemembers and reward the service they have given to our country   said

original GI Bill  countless veterans earned a good education  bought a home or started a business   As a soldier who deployed twice since 9 11  I am proud to help the next generation live that same American dream           The 21st Century GI Bill of Rights Act of 2007 will guarantee eligibility to all servicemembers    Active Duty  National Guard  and Reserves    who have served since September

areas of science  technology  engineering  education  and health care  As a beneficiary of the Vietnam Era G I  Bill  and president of a University that welcomed hundreds of G I  s to its campus post

a non partisan organization  the Coalition to Salute America s Heroes believes that the benefits and care for all military service members and veterans should be a bi partisan effort of Congress   said Joe Washam  Chief Liaison of Government Affairs  Salute America s Heroes            The Reserve Officers Association recognizes the importance of enacting legislation to reform and enhance the educational opportunities available to reservists   While much has been done to place members of the reserve components on equal standing with their active counterparts with regard to benefits  services  and recruiting incentives  Reservists face unique pressures and concerns that their active counterparts do not   They must balance civilian employment commitments with voluntary military service and excel at both   The GI Bill has been an invaluable asset to the individual service member seeking to strengthen their minds and continue contributing to the nation after their military service  It also provides an irreplaceable incentive to our youngest generation to remain in uniform   said CAPT Michael P  Smith  USN  Ret    President of the Reserve Officers Association           Homeownership is often referred to as the American Dream  As the leading advocates for homeownership and affordable housing  Realtors     have long supported policies that make housing more accessible
