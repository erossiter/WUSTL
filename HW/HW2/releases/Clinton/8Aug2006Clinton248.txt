August 8  2006 Senator Clinton Calls for BP to Fix Damaged Pipeline Without Passing Cost on to Consumers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Reiterates Call for Release of Oil from Strategic Petroleum Reserve      Underscores Need for Federal Government to Ensure All Oil Pipelines Are Maintained and Inspected Chicago  IL    Following the revelation of damage to BP pipeline that is pushing already staggering gas prices even higher  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today underscored that BP should be held responsible for allowing the pipeline to corrode and should use some of its billions of dollars in excess windfall profits to fix the pipeline without passing the cost onto consumers   To help provide immediate relief to consumers  Senator Clinton reiterated her call for the Bush Administration to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  following up on her letter to President Bush yesterday urging this immediate action   Senator Clinton also underscored that the federal government must take responsibility for inspecting all of America  s oil and gas pipelines  Some parts of the oil pipeline system  including the 16 mile section BP allowed to corrode  are exempt from federal pipeline safety regulations   Senator Clinton  s call came in remarks before the American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees 37th International Convention          The following is the excerpt of Senator Clinton  s remarks calling for this action            I don  t know if you  ve heard that one of the pipelines up in Alaska is corroded  Now that  s going to have to be shut down for months and that means that we  re not going to have the supply of oil coming to our country from Alaska that we have counted on          Well  the oil company called BP that allowed that pipeline to be corroded  they  ve got to be held responsible  So I think we should do a couple of things   We should take some oil out of what  s called our Strategic Petroleum Reserve and we ought to put it into the market so that gas prices don  t shoot up on the West Coast and then travel East to affect the rest of us  And then I think that BP should use some of the billion of dollars in excess windfall profits to fix that pipeline without passing on the cost to the rest of us   And wouldn  t it be a novel idea for our government to start inspecting pipelines again  like they should be inspecting work places  inspecting mines  inspecting working conditions to keep us safer           So I think that when it comes to this particular situation some of that money that goes in subsidies to the oil companies ought to be used to inspect our infrastructure because you know we have thousands of miles of pipeline  I find it hard to believe that there are only 16 miles that have been neglected by only this one oil company  And I am tired of cleaning up the messes of oil companies that are making more money than they know what to do with
