June 17  2005 Senator Clinton to Introduce Respite Care Legislation  to Provide Relief to Family Caregivers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Valhalla  NY    Today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was joined by leaders at Blythedale Children s Hospital in announcing that she will be introducing the Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2005  The bill  which she is expected to introduce with Senator John W  Warner  R VA  on Monday  will provide grants for states and local bodies to increase the availability of respite care in their regions  and to help families care for their loved ones at home          This legislation recognizes respite care as a priority for caregivers and would help families like those that I have visited with today to obtain the much needed respite that they deserve  I think that it is time that we make caregiving a national priority and provide the support that our family caregivers so desperately need   Senator Clinton said          For the over 3 million family care givers in New York  the problem is simple  there are never enough hours in the day  The emotional  physical and financial toll that care giving exacts is extraordinary  But sadly  current respite care programs are unable to provide relief to overtaxed care givers who need a helping hand   Senator Clinton said        An estimated 18 million children have chronic physical  developmental  behavioral  or emotional conditions that demand caregiver monitoring  management  supervision  and or treatment beyond that required of children generally  1 in 5 million Americans care for a family member or friend who is chronically ill  disabled or unable to care for themselves  Furthermore  4 million Americans with mental retardation or a developmental disability rely on family members for care and supervision  If services provided by family caregivers were replaced by paid services it would cost over  200 billion annually         Ideally  these caregivers remain in their home  permitting care recipients to live less restricted  more independent lives  As we know  for the disabled as well as children and older adults  remaining at home  surrounded by friends and family in familiar surroundings  is clinically proven to be the most positive of reinforcements  Therefore  families need assistance in being able to choose that option without having to fully bear financial  emotional  and physical hardship         Senator Clinton introduced the Lifespan Respite Care Act in both 2002 and 2003  While  the legislation was approved by the Senate in 2003 and endorsed by over 140 national and regional organizations  it did not make it through the House
