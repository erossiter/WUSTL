July 21  2006 Schumer  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Approval of  37 3 Million in Defense and Military Construction Funding for Western New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Funds included in Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill and Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Bill Washington  DC    Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed approval late yesterday by the Senate Appropriations Committee of the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill and the Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Bill  which includes  37 3 million for Western New York           The bills will now proceed to the Senate floor for consideration   Following consideration and passage on the Senate floor  the bills will head into a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between their versions  Following conference  the bills will again be sent to the House and Senate for final approval  after which they will be sent to the President for his signature            This is great news for Western New York   said Senator Schumer    Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put Western New York and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Western New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge   Secondly  I will keep fighting tooth and nail for the Niagara Air Reserve Station  and this funding is another sign that the base is vital to our national defense     Schumer said    We will leave no stone unturned as we make the case to strengthen the mission at NARS  which is important to Niagara and important to our country               As our men and women in uniform continue to fight bravely overseas  these New York companies are helping to support them with the best equipment and technology available  This funding is a tremendous boost to these local companies who are on the cutting edge of research and development and are also local employers  contributing to our regional economy  As we look to develop the state  s future as a center for research and results  these are the kinds of investments that we need to continue making     Senator Clinton said    I am also thrilled that the Senate Appropriators have retained the funding for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station VAQ  This funding is critical to the upgrading of the facility and to its future mission             Funding in the FY 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Bill includes          7 8 million for the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station IAP VQ    The Senate Military Construction Appropriations bill includes  7 800 000 to complete Phase 2 of a new visiting quarters and parking lot on an existing open area  This facility is required to accommodate personnel on unit training assemblies  annual training and special training status   Senator Schumer and Senator Clinton have worked hard to support the construction of the Visiting Airman  s Quarters          Funding in the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill includes          CUBRC    Lens X Hypervelocity Ground Testing    3 5 million    CUBRC has designed and tested a prototype of a revolutionary ground test facility capable of performing ground testing of full scale missile and space systems at Mach numbers from 10 to 22  These funds will fully complete  instrument and test this facility prior to the demonstration of its performance in investigating the communication  guidance and aero heating problems associated with advanced missile and space systems to mitigate the risks and costs associated with the new hypervelocity missile systems in initial development by the DOD  CUBRC is a strategic partnership whose mission is to bring together scientists and engineers from academia and industry to provide the synergism to expand the research capabilities of all and provide significant growth opportunities in Western New York         Carwell Products    Army Corrosion Prevention and Control Program    4 million   Carwell Products    USMC Corrosion Prevention and Control Program    4 million    This funding will be used to expand the Department of Defense  s highly successful Corrosion Prevention and Control  CPC  Program and make it more responsive to current and future operations   This program focuses on extending the useful life of all Army and Marine Corps tactical ground and ground support equipment by reducing maintenance requirements and associated costs due to corrosion damage   The authorized funding would also create more highly effective mobile corrosion service teams  CST   Both the Army and The Marine Corps are currently using these CSTs with great effect  The mobile teams are most useful when used in lower density troop areas and where the use of fixed Corrosion Control Centers is not practical or cost effective  This effort is being expanded to include ports  depots and Army Propositioned Stock locations as well         NanoDynamics  Inc    Portable SOFC JP 8 Demonstrator    2 million    The Army has identified a critical need for lightweight man portable power  chargers  and power management for dismounted soldiers    In order to simplify logistics  the Army has selected JP 8 as the single fuel for future use   All vehicles and fuel consuming systems such as generators will be fueled by JP 8 in the future   Work has already begun work to scale up a small compact portable solid oxide fuel cell system to develop a technology demonstration system that produces 250 Watts of power utilizing JP 8 fuel   Past research has focused on the development of cells that were electrochemically efficient when operating on reformed JP 8 fuel and has been successful in developing a cell that has demonstrated no power loss when operating on JP 8 reformate   NanoDynamics will take the package and integrate them with the pumps  fans  fuel system  and control electronics necessary to produce a portable 50 Watt system   The system development work will based upon the existing NanoDynamics RevolutionTM 50 portable fuel cell system that was developed for commercial applications       Dresser Rand    Advanced Steam Turbine    2 million    The advanced steam turbine will help the Navy meet their requirement to develop technologies and systems for submarines that will match or excel current systems capability while significantly reducing the acquisition and life cycle costs   The development of an advanced steam turbine  using similar magnetic bearings technology  is estimated to reduce the cost the Navy is paying today by as much as 40 percent  Additionally  through improved efficiencies  the expectation is a turbine with more Effective Full Power Hours  EFPH  during its life        Northrop Grumman Amherst   Joint Threat Emitter  Mountain Home AFB     10 million Northrop Grumman Amherst    Joint Threat Emitter for PTA     4 million     The Joint Threat Emitter  JTE  system simulates electronic combat signals and is designed to provide realistic electronic warfare training for pilots and aircrew members   JTE has the capability to generate six modern threats from one platform and replaces aging  more expensive  single threat per platform units  which are more costly to support and do not have the flexibility to generate modern combat environments   The JTE capabilities  including the highly lethal   double digit   threats  add an essential element to combat training ranges   The system is specifically designed to allow spiral upgrades to ensure future threats are quickly integrated into its design   This funding will assist the Department of Defense in purchasing three additional JTEs
