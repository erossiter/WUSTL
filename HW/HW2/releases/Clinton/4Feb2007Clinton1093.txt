                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Choices In Child Care Act Addresses Severe Shortage of Child Care Providers for Low and Middle Income Families                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC   In anticipation of tomorrow  s 14th anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she will reintroduce legislation to expand leave flexibility for working families   The Choices in Child Care Act will enable parents who qualify for child care assistance to use their subsidy for one year of paid leave              The Family and Medical Leave Act has made all the difference in the lives of Americans who otherwise would not be able to take time off from work to care for a sick child or parent   Now it  s time to build on that foundation   One of the big challenges families face is juggling work and child care   Too many parents don  t qualify for leave after the birth of a child and we face a severe shortage of quality  affordable child care providers who care for newborn infants for parents who are eligible to receive child care assistance   Our hardest working families should not have to sacrifice quality for affordability when it comes to child care   We should give parents the option to use their child care benefits to take paid leave     said Senator Clinton           As First Lady  Senator Clinton helped enact the Family and Medical Leave Act  the first legislative initiative of the Clinton Administration   Since the landmark act was signed into law  more than 50 million working Americans have been able to take critical time off when necessary without putting their jobs on the line   Today  Senator Clinton emphasized the need to continue to recognize and address the challenges families face in balancing work and family responsibilities  including the growing struggle working parents are facing in accessing quality child care for their newborn infants           The reality of today  s economy is that most parents must work to provide economic security for their families a reality that is particularly true when a new baby is welcomed into the family   In fact  55 percent of women with infants younger than one year of age are in the workforce  As a result  working parents are faced with trying to provide economic security for their family while simultaneously ensuring that their infant receives the quality care that he or she needs          The Choices in Child Care Act would give qualified families greater flexibility in providing safe  quality care for their infants  The bill would help parents balance work and family  help meet the critical shortage of infant child care  provide cost savings to state child care programs  support quality care for the critical first years of a child  s development  and value parenting as a form of work   The legislation is modeled on creative programs states have established to provide low income parents of infants a choice between returning to work and using a state child care subsidy to care for their infant or caring for their infant themselves with a monthly child care stipend   The Choices in Child Care Act would make these programs available to families across the country           Senator Clinton first introduced the legislation during the 109th Congress   Representative Rosa DeLauro  D CT  has introduced companion legislation in the House          Senator Clinton has worked for more than 30 years to address the challenges faced by working parents   Senator Clinton is also a co sponsor of the Healthy Families Act  which would help the more than half of all employees who have no paid sick leave and many more unable to take time off to care for a sick child by providing workers with seven paid days of sick leave  giving parents time off from work to go to the doctors office with their child or aging relative or to address their own health needs   Senator Clinton is also a co sponsor and strong supporter of the Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act  which takes the next step towards helping parents balance work and family by providing paid family and medical leave to qualifying individuals  This bill also would allow employees to take up to 24 hours a year to participate in school activities of a son or daughter  such as a parent teacher conference  or to participate in literacy training under a family literacy program
