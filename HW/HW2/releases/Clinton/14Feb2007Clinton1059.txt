February 14  2007 Waxman  Schumer  and Clinton Unveil Bill to Create Clear Pathway for Generic Biologic Drugs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Access to Life Saving Medicine Act  Would Lower Patient Drug Costs for Drugs Used to Treat Diseases Like Cancer  Diabetes  AIDS Washington  DC    Today Rep  Henry A  Waxman  Sen  Charles E  Schumer  and Sen  Hillary Rodham Clinton  along with Rep  Jo Ann Emerson and Rep  Frank Pallone  introduced the  Access to Life Saving Medicine Act   which will give Food and Drug Administration  FDA  the express legal authority to approve safe  lower cost copies of biotech drugs  also known as biologics or biopharmaceuticals   Biotech drugs  which are produced from living cell cultures rather than being synthesized chemically  are among the fastest growing and most expensive components of the nation s drug bill   Currently there is no statutory pathway for generic versions of biotech drugs to enter the market  even after all patents have expired   As a result  the manufacturers of biotech drugs can charge monopoly prices  indefinitely   In addition to the members listed above  Senators David Vitter  Debbie Stabenow  Patrick J  Leahy  Susan M  Collins and Representative Rahm Emanuel are original cosponsors of the legislation           We learned 22 years ago that generic drug competition brings consumers affordable  safe  and effective medicines   said Rep  Waxman    The time has come to apply this competition to biotech drugs   This bill will give FDA the clear legal authority to approve safe and effective copies of biotech drugs            Biologics treat some of the most devastating diseases around and no one should be denied access to them because of they re too expensive   said Sen  Schumer    Generic biologics can be a safe and affordable alternative to high priced brand name biologics   Our legislation will allow all Americans to take advantage of these drugs by enabling competition in the market to lower the price and ending permanent monopolies over biologic products   It is high time for these vital treatments to become more affordable and our legislation is just what the doctor ordered             We have witnessed dramatic scientific advances over the past twenty years in the field of biopharmaceuticals but our health care system has not kept pace   Biotech drugs hold great promise  however  we break that promise when costs push treatment out of reach for American families and employers  We should bring safe  effective and affordable generic versions of these medicines to patients  It will save money and save lives   said Senator Clinton          Biotech drugs can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year  imposing financial burdens on patients  employers  insurers  and federal and state governments   The  Access to Life Saving Medicine Act  will authorize FDA to approve abbreviated applications for biological products that are  comparable  to previously approved brand name biological products and it gives the FDA the authority to require any additional clinical information it deems necessary           This bill comes in response to years of recognition of the need for a new statutory pathway for approval of generic versions of biotech drugs   These products are not subject to the 1984 law that first authorized FDA to approve generic drugs   The EMEA  which is Europe s equivalent of the FDA  has had a legal framework in place for approval of  biosimilars  since 2004   In letters received recently  both the AARP and the Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market    composed of employers  health plans  generic drug companies  pharmacy benefit managers  and pharmacists    agree that legislation creating a pathway for approval of generic biologics is critically important to assure access to more affordable drugs          Demonstrating that a generic version of a biotech drug is the same as the brand name product raises more complicated scientific issues than for traditional drugs   The bill therefore establishes a rigorous  case by case scientific process for approving these products to make sure they are as safe and as effective as their brand name counterparts   Recent approvals by FDA of similar products  like Omnitrope  a human growth hormone drug approved on the basis of abbreviated tests   show that this approach is scientifically feasible           Generic drugs significantly lower medical costs for Americans and bring many life saving drugs within affordable reach   said Senator Vitter   But biological based drugs   which are among the most expensive on the market   cannot be produced generically under current law   Insulin is a prime example  and with Louisiana having the highest rate of diabetes in the United States  this bill is crucial to ensuring that life saving medicines are reasonably priced             Generic biologics have the potential to save Medicare Part B  14 billion per year  according to the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association   said Rep  Jo Ann Emerson   These are often some of the most expensive medications in the marketplace  so the possibility of achieving savings for seniors and taxpayers is very important   As of today  there are no such alternatives to brand name biologics on the market  some of whose patents expired seven to ten years ago   Bringing generic biologics should be a priority for this Congress  with a sharp eye to the future solvency of the Medicare program             Biologic drugs provide effective treatments for some of our most devastating diseases   Unfortunately  however  these drugs are often prohibitively expensive and can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year   It is my hope that by creating a process to bring safe and effective generic versions of biologic drugs to the market  we will increase access and dramatically reduce costs for patients  employers  and federal and state health programs   said Senator Collins           Families in Michigan and across the country are struggling with the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs  and we need to do everything we can to keep those prices under control   said Senator Stabenow    Lowering the cost of prescription drugs for America s employers is not only good for patients  it is the best way to protect our jobs and stay competitive in a global economy   By opening the market to generic biological drugs this bill will provide real savings to businesses and consumers on some of the most costly medications            Biologic therapies hold the promise of preventing  treating or curing otherwise inevitable  untreatable and incurable diseases   said Senator Leahy   This important legislation will facilitate the approval of safe and effective generic biological products that may serve as less expensive    yet potent    alternatives for consumers            Biologic drugs have the potential to improve the lives of millions of Americans  but their high costs often keep them out of reach for many   said Representative Pallone    I support efforts to increase generic versions of these lifesaving products as long as we strike the right balance between safety and access  which I believe this bill does            The bill has been endorsed by Aetna  the AFL CIO  the Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market  Consumer s Union  General Motors  Generic Pharmaceuticals Association  Express Scripts  Inc  and National Organization of Rare Disorders
