is great news for the Finger Lakes   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Finger Lakes and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Finger Lakes defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge              The Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes regions have already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology     Senator Clinton said    This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support              Photon Gear will receive  2 million in federal funds for Agile Laser Eye Protection research  Hostile use of lasers against U S  military assets to inflict injury  damage targeting sensors  and mission denial through dazzling of personnel   sensors are growing threats  The eyesight of aircrew and electro optical sensors are of particular concern due to their susceptibility to damage  Currently available laser eye protection targets known  fixed wavelength laser threats  While a fieldable  day only Agile form of laser eye protection is nearing completion  there is an urgent need for an integrated frequency agile form of laser eye protection that simultaneously protects during both day and night operations  An intensified frequency agile device would ultimately provide cost savings to the military by eliminating the need for different protection to cover all the potential wavelengths suitable for day and night time use  Funding will go towards the development of an intensified frequency agile device that would eliminate the need for different protection to cover all the potential wavelengths suitable for day and night time use            Virtual Scopics will receive  1 65 million in federal funds for Oblique Angle Hyperspectral Image Fusion and Analysis for Change Detection research  Current hyperspectral targeting systems must fly directly over targets and are therefore vulnerable to shoot down  They are also vulnerable to deception using two dimensional decoys  These funds will support the development of systems that will permit targeting at long range thus reducing risk to targeting system from shoot down  These systems will also develop novel image registration capabilities in order to perform change detection and three dimensional modeling             1 million is provided in the bill for Integrated Nanotechnology of Henrietta for its Bio Warfare Testing program  This funding would support the development of a Special Operations Field Biological Agent Identification System  a light weight  portable  highly reliable system for detection and identification of specific biological agents in support of Special Operations Command  would locate  identify and render safe weapons of mass destruction           The Rochester Institute of Technology  RIT  will receive  3 million in federal funds for the Defense Systems Modernization and Sustainment Initiative  The objective of this research program is to improve the modernization  readiness and sustainment of defense systems by developing processes and tools to track the status and future health of defense systems  detect  diagnose and repair material aging failures  and provide decision support systems for use in determining when and how to upgrade these systems  The Department of Defense  while developing new systems that will enable a leap ahead or transformation in military capability  must simultaneously maintain and improve the capabilities of existing systems  The number and complexity of legacy systems  as well as the staggering replacement costs  demand that attention and resources continue to be effectively allocated to current systems  This research program provides DOD with a comprehensive approach to address these issues based on life cycle engineering principles  Over the past several years  these programs have already yielded significant cost savings for the manufacture and upgrade of several platforms and systems  as well as significantly extending the life of existing systems            2 million in federal funds will go to General Motors for the Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion initiative  Funding will support the design  development and demonstration of next generation non tactical vehicle propulsion technology to enhance mission performance capability  increase fuel economy and reduce exhaust emissions of U S  military non tactical vehicles at U S  military installations  Following on development begun last year  the initiative proposes to demonstrate two commercially based non tactical SUV style vehicles with a single front wheel drive utilizing the latest designs in the fuel cell power unit  The General Motors light truck evaluated in this demonstration will utilize fuel cells designed and built in Honeoye Falls  NY            2 million in federal funds will be awarded to the National Center for Infotonics  Photonics and micro systems will be the key components in many future technologies and weapons systems of the military  Funding will support research into photonics and micro systems applications for defense applications  Measurement and Control Systems  Information and Communications Systems and Power Technologies  Technologies developed at the National Center for Infotonics will also have chem bio detection and health monitoring applications          5 1 million in federal funds will go to Icuiti for the Advanced Multipurpose Microdisplay System  Special Operations Forces employ a vast array of sophisticated sensors such as thermal and infrared devices  video from unmanned aerial vehicles  and massive amounts of digital information from sensors used to detect targets or nuclear  biological  and chemical threats   Special Operations Forces urgently need a SOF Counter proliferation Visualization System that will integrate advanced microdisplay and miniature electronics with a heads up display  personal digital assistant computer  wireless communication  and a target vector head tracking system for advanced  hands free situation awareness   Icuiti Corporation has a new microdisplay based low profile lens system that can be integrated into a standard pair of sunglasses   Special Operations users could view data from a variety of sources  without anyone knowing they are wearing it   Covert operators could receive real time mission and sensor information without any risk of compromising their status  First prototype articles are scheduled for delivery to USSOCOM by the end of this calendar year   This funding will help finish the development of the lens and display system            1 million in federal funds will go towards VirtualScopics   Work Flow Engine for Off Line Image Analysis   Currently deployed sensor systems generate far more image data than can be effectively analyzed in a timely fashion currently   There is a critical need for a flexible  user configurable image analysis system for off line analysis of collected surveillance and reconnaissance data  VirtualScopics has a unique combination of expertise in workflow engine design for efficient image analysis  image analysis automation  and task specific issues related to analysis of hyperspectral optical imagery and synthetic aperture radar   The project will develop a task configurable end to end image analysis system incorporating data management  spectral detection for minefields  chemical plumes  etc   and assisted target recognition   Such a system could be of high utility both to stateside analysts and to the warfighter in the field
