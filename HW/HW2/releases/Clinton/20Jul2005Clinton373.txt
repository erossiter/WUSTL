July 20  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Reaction to Entertainment Software Rating Board Investigation of Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC     I am glad that the Entertainment Software Rating Board  s investigation has gotten to the bottom of this very troubling issue and has taken the much needed action of changing the rating of this game from M to AO   But the fact remains that the company gamed the ratings system and enabled pornographic material to get into the hands of children            So many parents already feel like they are fighting a battle against violence and sexually explicit material with their hands tied behind their backs  We need companies to be responsible and we need rating systems that work            While I applaud the ESRB for its quick and thorough investigation  I urge the ESRB to redouble its efforts to make sure something like this doesn  t happen again and that games already reviewed do not have the same vulnerabilities   And I hope the company will follow through on its pledge to urge retailers to pull this game off the shelves until proper labels are put in place   I also hope it allows parents to return the game for a refund
