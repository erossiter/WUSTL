                 Washington  DC  New Jersey and New Yorks U S  Senators announced today a House Senate Conference Committee has approved two measures they authored to reduce flight delays and ease congestion in the New York New Jersey airspace as part of the final Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies  TTHUD  FY08 Appropriations Bill   One amendment would require the federal government to provide a plan to Congress to reduce flight delays in the New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Region  the nations most densely congested airspace   The other amendment requires the investigative arm of Congress  the Government Accountability Office to investigate the Administrations Airspace Redesign Plan  as well as the effectiveness of a variety of approaches used nationwide to reduce flight delays  The Senators called for action after record airport delays this summer and amid major concerns that the Federal Aviation Administrations announced Airspace Redesign for the New York New Jersey Philadelphia area will increase aircraft noise while providing only minimal delay reductions    Were coming up on another busy holiday season full of exasperating lines and endless delays for the flying public  said Senator Menendez  who sponsored the amendment mandating a Government Accountability Office study of flight delay reduction options and co sponsored Senator Clintons amendment requiring a report from the Secretary of Transportation  Air travelers deserve relief from the worsening flight delays  and we are giving the administration a push toward taking action  It is important that these provisions are in the bill  and it is important that they become law  We need real solutions to give travelers relief from constant flight delays  said Senator Lautenberg   Our aviation system is a mess and the Bush Administrations congestion plan is no solution   It would create more aircraft noise in more neighborhoods throughout our region without providing relief from delays   Our measure would require a better study of how to improve flight delays without causing the excessive air noise that plagues so many communities  Reducing congestion and restoring order to our crowded skies is critical for our nations transportation system  for the safety and comfort of air travelers  and for the quality of life for our communities on the ground  This legislation will require the federal government to finally do the planning necessary to address the problems that plague our air transit system  including frustrating delays  chronic gridlock and excessive noise  Senator Clinton said  I am pleased that these amendments will be in the final version of the bill and I look forward to them becoming law  We need aggressive  comprehensive action to break the gridlock in our skies  and these amendments will force the FAA and administration to take a long  hard look at the process and potential pitfalls behind the FAAs long and short term plans  and produce real recommendations for how to fix our congested aviation system  Senator Schumer said  Details of the FAA Plan amendment Directs the GAO to conduct a study of the efficacy of various approaches used in the past by the FAA and the DOT to address delays at our nation s airports  Within 120 days of enactment  the GAO is to report which strategies have worked best to comprehensively reduce flight delays at an airport within 6 months or less  Specifically  the GAO is instructed to examine efforts by the FAA to induce voluntary schedule reductions at Chicago s O Hare International Airport  the FAA s mandatory flight reduction operations at LaGuardia International Airport and Reagan National Airport  the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Metropolitan Area Airspace Redesign and any other significant efforts by the FAA or the DOT to reduce flight delays at a major U S  international airport  Details of the GAO amendment Specifically  the amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit to Congress a report detailing how the Federal Aviation Administration plans to alleviate air congestion and flight delays in the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Airspace by August 31  2008  The report would have to be submitted to no later than 120 days after the enactment of the legislation  A Joint House Senate Conference Committee included the two amendments in the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation  Housing  and Urban Development Appropriations bill  which now goes to the full House and Senate for final approval before heading to the President for his signature
