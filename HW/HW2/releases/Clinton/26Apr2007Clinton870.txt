April 26  2007 Clinton Calls on Secretary Chertoff to Help Western New York in Light of Administration s Failure to Reach Agreement on Shared Border Management with Canada                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today reacted to news from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff that after nearly three years of negotiation  the Administration has been unable to reach an agreement and to resolve its differences on Shared Border Management with Canada           Senator Clinton was informed of the inability to reach an agreement in a call from Secretary Chertoff  following which she wrote the Secretary asking that he provide guidance  as well as the resources  to the City of Buffalo and the State of New York in order to develop a plan to address the impending problems   Senator Clinton s office also contacted the Canadian Embassy to ask for a briefing from them on their concerns related to Shared Border Management           A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below          April 25  2007      The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C  20528      Dear Mr  Secretary       The City of Buffalo  the State of New York  the Peace Bridge Authority and the entire New York Congressional delegation have been waiting for nearly three years for a resolution to the Shared Border Management  SBM  issue and it is extremely disappointing to hear from you today that you are unable to resolve the differences with the Canadian Government and come to an agreement acceptable to all parties   Now that you have come to the conclusion that SBM cannot be achieved given the complex legal and sovereignty issues with Canada  then it is incumbent upon the Department of Homeland Security to take responsibility in providing guidance  as well as the resources  to Western New York and the City of Buffalo and the State of New York to develop a plan to address this continuing problem          The City and the State cannot be made to shoulder this burden alone   Additionally  the failure to come to an agreement on SBM could possibly result in the construction of a larger  more expansive processing facility for the Peace Bridge that will encroach on local communities in the City of Buffalo   Be mindful that any plan you develop needs to take into account the consequences of any construction   Because border management is a federal responsibility  I look forward to hearing your alternative solution to this complex problem          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
