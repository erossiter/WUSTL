                                                                                                                                                                                                                         New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed the announcement by President Bush of an emergency declaration for Erie  Genesee  Orleans and Niagara Counties  triggering the release of federal funds that will help the community respond to last week s snowstorm            I am pleased that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved our request for an emergency declaration in Erie  Genesee  Orleans and Niagara Counties  The emergency declaration will provide federal funding for emergency protective measures  debris removal and incidental snow removal  Federal funding will cover 75  of the costs associated with the initial response to this emergency           I have seen the extent of the damage with my own eyes and I know that there is much to be done  But I have also seen the incredible efforts of the local community to get back on its feet  I will continue to do everything I can to help Buffalo and the other impacted counties recover and rebuild as soon as possible          I appreciate FEMA  s quick response to our calls for assistance and I will continue my discussions with FEMA to push for a major disaster declaration if it is needed  I will also continue to monitor the power situation as well as other efforts associated with the storm and will continue to work with FEMA and other officials to ensure that the federal government provides any additional support as needed             Last Friday  Senator Clinton joined with Senator Charles Schumer  Congressman Brian Higgins and Congresswoman Louise Slaughter  writing letters to President Bush and Governor Pataki  urging them to take the necessary steps to provide federal aid to the impacted region           According to the President  s office  the action today authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population  and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures  authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act  to save lives  protect property and public health and safety  and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in the counties of  Erie  Genesee  Orleans  and Niagara  Under the announcement  Public Assistance will be made available to State and local governments for debris removal and emergency protective measures to save lives  protect public health and safety  and property  FEMA is authorized to identify  mobilize  and provide at its discretion  equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency  Debris removal and emergency protective measures will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding         Copies of Friday s letters are below       October 13  2006  The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20500 0005      Dear Mr  President       We write in anticipation of a request from Governor Pataki seeking a Major Disaster Area Declaration for Western New York and we urge your quick approval  A major disaster declaration would make the area eligible for federal funding to mitigate the unexpected and un seasonal snow storm that has dropped over 19 inches of snow on Buffalo and the surrounding area  Because this snow is so early in the season  the snowfall  s pressure on trees with leaves still on the branches is causing many to fall resulting in widespread damage to power lines and other infrastructure           The snow has caused excessive damage to infrastructure and private property  cut off power to over 300 000 homes and businesses  closed roadways including 105 miles of the New York State Thruway  and has left area hospitals short on medical staff and patients unable to get care  To recover  residents will need disaster grants and low interest loans to repair their homes and heating systems for the long winter ahead  We also presume that local governments  already stretched by structural financial shortfalls  will need further assistance to restore infrastructure and to assist their citizens  In addition  we ask that you release the remaining emergency Low Income Heating Assistance Program funds to help families in need cope with heating costs           We urge you to approve the declaration request as soon as possible and we look forward to working with you to help the citizens of Western New York recover from this storm           Sincerely                     October 13  2006      The Honorable George E  Pataki  Governor  State Capitol  Albany  NY 12224      Dear Governor Pataki       We write today to pledge our support in securing the maximum federal assistance possible to assist the Greater Buffalo region as it recovers from the record breaking snowstorm of this week  It is our understanding that you have declared four counties in New York to be under a state of disaster  are in the process of completing Preliminary Damage Assessments  PDAs  on the affected area  and will soon formally ask President Bush to declare the region a major disaster area  so that he may immediately activate the federal assistance essential for the response and recovery effort  We want to thank you for your prompt and thorough response to this disaster           As you know  the snowstorm that began yesterday and continued through today dumped between 18 and 24 inches of snow on parts of western New York  At least 350 000 people are without power  and have been told not to expect restored electricity until the middle of next week  The airport has been closed indefinitely  and roads all over the area have been shut down  The National Incident Management Organization has called upon 160 crews from across the country to assist with the shocking number of downed trees  downed wires have caused so many fires that the fire department has been forced to let vacated buildings continue to burn  As the wind speeds pick up  and flurries continue to fall  the damage is only expected to worsen           While the residents and businesses of the Buffalo region are no strangers to snowstorms of great magnitude  it is highly unusual to be hit by such a storm in mid October  Thus  the people and businesses of Buffalo were unprepared for this record breaking storm  and need federal assistance immediately  The Buffalo area simply cannot bear the extra financial burden placed upon it by unexpectedly severe storms           We want you to know that we will fully support you and your office in any way that we can as the affected region recovers  We look forward to working with you to ensure that FEMA will provide these areas with much needed aid  If we may be of any help  please contact          Sincerely
