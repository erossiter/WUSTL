             Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to commission a comprehensive review of the quality of care being received by wounded veterans  both past and present  at VA facilities around the country   She also asked for a review of the VA s process of evaluating wounded veterans for disability benefits             As a nation  we have a duty to honor and support those who have served and sacrificed so much in the defense of freedom   Senator Clinton wrote    In light of recent revelations over the treatment of wounded

    Senator Clinton visited the Walter Reed Medical Center last week to see the conditions firsthand   During her visit  she visited wounded soldiers at the hospital and met with New York servicemembers to hear their concerns  She also toured Building 18  which news reports have identified as housing soldiers in unacceptable conditions  Following her visit  Senator Clinton reiterated her call for an independent investigation of the Army s response to the problems at Walter Reed  Senator Clinton requested the investigation yesterday in a letter to the Army Inspector General  Read

Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20420      Dear Mr  Secretary       I write to you to address the growing crisis regarding the treatment of our wounded servicemembers and veterans   As you know  recent revelations regarding the Department of Defense s substandard care for wounded active duty servicemembers at facilities such as Walter Reed Army Medical Center have also raised questions about the treatment of our wounded veterans at Veterans Administration  VA  facilities and the manner in which disability benefit determinations are made   Press accounts have raised concerns about the quality of care being given to wounded veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the lack of fairness and oversight of the disability benefits process   Therefore  it is critical that the VA commission a comprehensive review of the quality of care being received by wounded veterans  both past and present  at VA facilities around the country and determine whether the current VA system in evaluating wounded veterans for disability benefits is properly functioning             According to recent news reports and studies  the VA is facing serious resource shortages that is impacting its ability to care for returning veterans  neglecting to prepare  plan and budget for the influx of new veterans that will come home when the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan come to an end  and maintaining a lock step approach for disability benefits determinations by using what some consider to be an outdated rating system  the Department of Veterans Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities   The Government Accountability Office  GAO  March 2006 study of disability benefits concluded that more oversight of the process was required and recommended that the schedule for rating disabilities be reviewed   Additionally  a recent study conducted by researchers at Harvard s Kennedy School of Government concluded that  the Veterans Health Administration is already overwhelmed by the volume of returning veterans and the seriousness of their health care needs  and it will not be able to provide a high quality of care in a timely fashion to the large wave of returning war veterans without greater funding and increased capacity in areas such as psychiatric care    Indeed  the Veterans Benefits Administration already has a current backlog of nearly 400 000 pending claims   If the VA does not make serious efforts to expand its capability to process claims for disability benefits in the near future  the ability of the VA to care for Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans will be jeopardized              I have recently proposed legislation that will ask the GAO to evaluate the Department of Veteran s Affairs Schedule for Rating Disabilities because of concerns that the disability rating system has not remained relevant for the nature of war wounds or diseases suffered and that our veterans can be better compensated   Specifically  the ratings for the wounds dealing with traumatic brain injuries  TBI   spinal injuries  amputations  post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   hearing loss  and diseases are outdated and do not accurately reflect the nature of the wounds that our veterans suffer   My recent visit to Walter Reed  where I spent time with numerous soldiers who have been suffering for a lack of care and unfair disability rating determinations  is further confirmation of the seriousness of the problem that our servicemembers and veterans face            As a nation  we have a duty to honor and support those who have served and sacrificed so much in the defense of freedom   In light of recent revelations over the treatment of wounded soldiers  it is important that the VA give the highest priority to helping wounded soldiers make a seamless transition to the VA system and ensuring that they receive the highest quality of care           Thank you for your consideration of this request           Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton           Read more about Walter Reed
