critical homeland security issues         October 5  2005         The Honorable Michael Chertoff       Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security       Washington  D C   20528         Dear Mr  Secretary        Thank you for meeting with me in order to discuss the importance of the Animal Disease Center on Plum Island and to continue our discussion on how we can work together to make New York and our nation  s homeland security as formidable as possible          I want to take this opportunity to raise with you again a matter of tremendous importance to my constituents and all Americans living along the U S  Canada border   Just this past Monday  I joined the St  Lawrence Chamber of Commerce  local community and business leaders  and elected officials at a forum to discuss the impact on northern border communities of the Department of Homeland Security  s proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative   There was consensus that while national security  and in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount  it is crucial that any new travel requirements be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism and the regional economy   There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers that the Initiative  s passport requirement would devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border        I have repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the local economic impact of the Initiative since it was first previewed in April   I have written to both you and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice on this crucial matter   I understand why the Department supports the Initiative  but I think its approach tilts the balance too far against having a border that is both safe and convenient to cross for most people   I strongly believe that this is an issue on which we can find a solution that protects our security and at the same time allows for the legal  unencumbered travel across the border that our border communities need to thrive          There is little doubt that the restrictions contemplated by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative would adversely affect the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border   The exchange of goods between the United States and Canada is the largest trading relationship in the world   Thirty nine states sell more of their products to Canada than to any other export market  and Canada is the 2nd largest market for the other eleven   In 2003  Canadians made over 5 7 million visits to New York and Michigan  spending over  550 million   Residents of those two states visited Canada over 16 million times in 2003   These numbers would likely decrease dramatically if a new  potentially onerous  form of documentation were required to enter the United States          Such a decrease could be devastating to the national economies of both countries  and most especially  to the economies of border regions like Buffalo Niagara   According to the Buffalo Niagara Partnership  Partnership   which represents nearly 3 000 employer members  requiring a passport for entry into the U S    will devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border      The Partnership notes that   in 2003  there were 3 8 million visits from Canadians to New York State  an increase of 70  over 2002   Those Canadians spent over  392 Million  US  in    New York   Moreover    major tourism developments  such as the over  100 million Bass Pro Project in Buffalo  are being planned based  in part  on the substantial buying power of Canadians in Metro Toronto and Southern Ontario   The Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres are dependent upon ticket sales to fans from Southern Ontario who have the option of watching the games on television rather than in person           The North Country of New York would also feel a profound impact   According to the Plattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce and its thousands of members    to require passports  or NEXUS cards where available  for U S  and Canadian citizens to cross the U S  Canadian border      will substantially discourage cross border travel    and   will depress travel and economic benefit    for both nations          The requirements of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative would also impose an unfair burden on the people of the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne   The Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne is part of the Greater Mohawk Nation   They presently live on a number of territories stretching along the Ottawa and St  Lawrence Rivers  by Lake Ontario and beyond  all the way to Brantford  Ontario  Canada   The territory called   Akwesasne    straddles the international boundary of Canada and the United States  and the national boundaries of two Canadian Provinces and the New York State Line   Given its unique location  the 7 000 members of this community would be devastated by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative if implemented in its current form   For example  the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino attracts over 600 000 visitors annually  with approximately 50 percent of their guests hailing from Canada   In addition  a recent informal poll of Mohawk business owners showed that 20 percent of their customers were from the other side of the border          Beyond these economic consequences  the Initiative also poses a threat to the daily lives of the Mohawk community   For example  about 70 percent of border traffic in the area is composed of Mohawks  who often take several trips across the border each day   Imposing upon them the type of travel restrictions contemplated by the Initiative would have a detrimental effect on many aspects of their daily lives   Perhaps most disturbing  the Initiative could interrupt the cross border travel of 1 300 Mohawk students living on the Canadian side of the border who attend the Salmon River and Massena school districts located on the U S  side          This last example underscores an important point   You should understand that this issue is not solely driven by economics   The people who live in these shared border areas do not regard themselves as Americans or Canadians  but rather as one community of neighbors   American children play sports in Canadian youth leagues   Canadian families visit relatives who live in the U S   Americans and Canadians frequent each others homes and businesses with little regard for the demarcation of the border   Limiting their ability to interact by forcing upon them the restrictions outlined in the Initiative would create a wall splitting one community into two        Lest you think the Initiative poses a unique problem to New York  s border communities  Senator Byron Dorgan  whose home state of North Dakota also shares a substantial U S  Canada border  introduced an amendment during consideration of the FY06 Homeland Security Appropriations bill   His amendment  which was adopted in the Senate by unanimous consent  would have prohibited the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State from issuing regulations to limit U S  citizens to a passport as the exclusive document to be presented upon entry into the U S  from Canada by land   Although this provision was ultimately deleted from the conference agreement during reconciliation of the House and Senate bills  it is clearly an issue of tremendous importance to all of my colleagues who likewise represent U S  Canada border communities         As you know  on September 1  2005  the Department formally submitted the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative for public comment   Although the Initiative  s effective date has been changed so that it is implemented at the end of 2006  and the Department has indicated that other documents issued under various programs designed to speed border crossings will be considered  according to the DHS release announcing the comment period    the passport will be the document of choice for travel within the Western Hemisphere or re entry      In addition to asking you to carefully consider those comments critical of the Initiative  I also invite you to visit New York  s North Country so that you can appreciate and properly put into context the ramifications of the Initiative  s requirements          There are several other Homeland Security issues of concern to New Yorkers and Americans alike which deserve your attention as well   For example  I agree with President Bush that the federal preparation for  and response to  Hurricane Katrina was not acceptable   There is no question that four years following the attacks of September 11th our nation should have been better prepared to effectively respond to a catastrophic event such as Hurricane Katrina   I have introduced legislation to establish an independent   Katrina Commission    to assess the problems that occurred at all levels of government    federal  state and local    before  during and after Hurricane Katrina made landfall   I urge you to support this inquiry for the betterment of our communities everywhere           Secondly  the lessons learned from the chaotic and disorderly evacuation of the Gulf region last month should be heeded by all communities as they re evaluate their ability to escape approaching danger   Events in the Gulf region have demonstrated the relative ineffectiveness of existing evacuation procedures in preserving human life in the path of extraordinarily powerful storms and other catastrophic events  and how difficult it is to perform such a large scale evacuation in practice   The New York State Hurricane Evacuation Study was published in 1993  well over a decade ago   Since then  the regional population has increased appreciably   To have any hope of effectively and efficiently performing an evacuation of such a densely populated area  extremely detailed planning will have to be done in advance   Therefore  I request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  provide the appropriate level of funding to the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  so that they may work in conjunction with appropriate state and local authorities  in order to facilitate an update and thorough refinement of the existing plan  expanded to cover the entire greater New York City metropolitan area        Additionally  FEMA operated effectively as an independent  Cabinet level agency throughout the 1990  s when the Director of FEMA reported directly to the President of the United States   I have proposed legislation that would restore FEMA  s independence and require that the Director and Deputy Director of FEMA have sufficient emergency services credentials to hold such important posts   I hope that you will support the restoration of FEMA to its status prior to the Department of Homeland Security  s reorganization          Finally  I share your view that we need to allocate our limited homeland security resources by employing threat and risk based formulas   Shortly  conferees will meet to reconcile the differences between the House and Senate versions of legislation intended to reauthorize the sunsetting provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act   During consideration of the House bill  Representatives Nita Lowey and John Sweeney sponsored an amendment that would require that threat  vulnerability and consequence be the first criteria considered when it comes to distributing homeland security grant funds   I urge you to advocate for the adoption of the Lowey Sweeney threat based funding formula so that we can adequately support those programs intended to safeguard our local governments and states most at risk        Thank you for your consideration of these requests   I am hopeful that working together  we can endeavor to persevere in making our homeland safe for all Americans        Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton         October 5  2005       The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security       Washington  D C   20528         Dear Mr  Secretary        As elected officials representing Long Island  we have worked hard to ensure the integrity of the research performed at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center  as well as the safety of its workforce and the surrounding community   During the transfer of Plum Island to the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   we met with Secretary Ridge  and were promised that   Bio Safety Level 3    work would continue at Plum Island  and that DHS would keep us fully informed about developments relating to the facility   Therefore  we were very disappointed to learn of your agency  s potential plans for Plum Island through a   fact sheet    we received in August          As you know  the DHS Appropriations conference report for FY 06 provides  23 million to study options and make plans for the proposed National Bio  and Agro  Defense Facility   We believe it is critical that this study and planning work include an assessment of how the Plum Island Animal Disease Center can be upgraded to continue to conduct   Bio Safety Level 3    research to help protect the nation  s food supply   This is in keeping with the understanding we reached with Secretary Ridge  and may be more cost effective than building a new facility elsewhere   To the extent that other sites are examined  we believe that the study should evaluate the costs that would be incurred in closing the facility and the remediating the Plum Island site for future uses   We ask that you include these evaluations as part of the  23 million study that DHS will undertake in the coming year         We recognize that the Plum Island facility is aging  and that the range of new threats to our nation s food supply call for new research infrastructure and capabilities   However  we strongly question whether it makes fiscal or policy sense to abandon the existing infrastructure and capabilities at Plum Island given its strategic location   Plum Island was first established as a foreign animal disease center because of its isolation  with no other communities or buildings occupying the island   In addition  the very limited livestock population on the surrounding mainland would limit the extent or possibility of an accidental outbreak of a very contagious and economically devastating disease like foot and mouth disease   With that in mind  Congress passed a law that mandated that active foot and mouth disease could only be researched and stored on an island  resulting in the establishment of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center         For all of these reasons  we think that Plum Island can and should continue to play a strong role in our defense against agro terrorism  and we urge you to utilize the funding provided in the FY 2006 conference report to that end        Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton          United States Senate         Timothy H  Bishop       United States House of Representatives
