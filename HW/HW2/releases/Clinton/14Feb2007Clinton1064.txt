February 14  2007 Senator Clinton and Congressman McHugh Urge Department of Agriculture to Fix Fish Import Rule that is Hurting Upstate New York Business                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congressman John M  McHugh  R NY  are urging the United States Department of Agriculture s  USDA  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  to fix a rule that is severely impacting Thousand Islands Fishery  a local fish importer in Alexandria Bay  NY           In October of last year  APHIS issued a federal emergency order immediately prohibiting the importation of 37 species of live fish from two Canadian provinces to contain the spread of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia  VHS    VHS is a pathogen of fresh and saltwater fish  and is causing an emerging disease in the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada  In a letter sent to APHIS Administrator Dr  Ron DeHaven  Clinton and McHugh both indicated their complete support for efforts to combat the spread of VHS and other invasive species  but said they believed that an exception could be made for fish that was taken from Canada for immediate processing and sale to restaurants  which would pose no threat to local waterways           There is no question that we must protect New York s lakes and streams  but the recent fish import ban goes too far in some cases and is hurting New York businesses   said Senator Clinton   I urge the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to act as quickly as possible to allow our North Country businesses to resume importing fish for uses that do not pose a threat to the health of New York s fisheries            While safeguarding the species in America s lakes and rivers is important  this is a prime example of federal regulations having unintended consequences   said Congressman McHugh    In this case  the rule is putting the livelihoods of small business owners at risk and it is imperative that federal officials expedite the process and issue an amended ruling on this matter           The letter explains the importance of certain species of fish  in particular Brown Bullhead  that are critical to the livelihood of small businesses like Thousand Islands Fishery  Importation of this type of fish from Canada for immediate processing and sale to restaurants presents a minimal risk of the spread of VHS  An interim ruling could lift the ban on importation of Brown Bullheads from Canada and include mechanisms to ensure that imports are properly tracked and handled in order to make sure that the imports did not result in the spread of VHS         The full text of the letter sent to Dr  DeHaven is below       Dr  Ron DeHaven  Administrator  U S  Department of Agriculture  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  1400 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  DC 20250      Dear Dr  DeHaven       We write in regards to the recent regulatory actions taken by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  to contain the spread of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia  VHS    While we support APHIS efforts to combat the spread of VHS and other animals and diseases that threaten the Great Lakes and many smaller New York water bodies  we are very concerned that this particular action may be unnecessarily affecting a New York fish importer          On October 24  2006  APHIS issued a federal emergency order immediately prohibiting the importation of 37 species of live fish susceptible to VHS from two Canadian provinces into the United States   The order also stopped interstate movement of the same species among the eight states bordering the Great Lakes  and is impacting New York businesses   We are particularly concerned about the impact of this order on New York businesses that import Brown Bullhead from Canada for processing and sale to restaurants          It is our understanding that importation of this type of fish from Canada for immediate processing and sale to restaurants presents a minimal risk of the spread of VHS   As a result  we understand that APHIS intends to lift the ban on importation of these fish as soon as the emergency order can be replaced with an interim rule that includes mechanisms to ensure that imports are properly tracked and handled   Imports are critical because there is no commercial fishery for this species in New York   The season for this fish will soon begin  and the survival of a small New York business may depend on a speedy resolution of this issue   We urge you to move as quickly as possible to issue an interim rule that will both allow imports of these fish and protect the Great Lakes and New York waters from the spread of VHS          We appreciate your consideration of our concerns and look forward to your reply          Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton  John M  McHugh
