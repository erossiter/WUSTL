April 17  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Reports that FEMA s New National Response Plan will not be Ready in Time for the Start of Hurricane Season                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    I am extremely concerned about reports that  nearly two years after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  will not have its new national response plan ready in time for the start of the hurricane season  One of the most devastating lessons we learned in 2005 is that we need to be prepared and I am stunned that after all this time FEMA still does not have a national response plan in place  There is no excuse for this failure in planning  Areas that are vulnerable to hurricanes  from Long Island to the Gulf Coast  look to the Federal Government for guidance but it appears that right now  FEMA s response resembles a blank stare  Hurricane Katrina left in its path not just death and devastation  but a deep  lasting scar and we cannot let it happen again  Parts of New York were just hit by a severe storm and we saw how devastating the results of this type of weather can be  We must do everything we can to make sure that we are prepared in the future and that includes having a national hurricane response plan           Since Hurricane Katrina  Senator Clinton has pushed for a better emergency response system from FEMA and has pushed to restore FEMA to Cabinet level  independent federal agency status to ensure that it has the authority it needs to effectively manage recovery efforts for future national crises   Read more            Senator Clinton has also worked with local and federal officials on New York s hurricane prone areas to evaluate preparedness levels and the infrastructure and logistical challenges that may be faced   Read more
