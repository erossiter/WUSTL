October 6  2005  Senators Clinton and Roberts Introduce Legislation to Ensure Adequate Flu Vaccine Supply                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   With the threat of a worldwide flu pandemic and an avian flu outbreak that would require rapid mobilization of our existing vaccine delivery infrastructure  it is more critical than ever to ensure that our basic seasonal flu vaccine production and distribution system is capable of delivering vaccines to all who need them   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Pat Roberts  KS  today introduced legislation to help prevent recurring shortages of flu vaccine and strengthen our vaccine delivery infrastructure so that we are able to respond to a crisis            Despite three shortages of seasonal flu vaccine since 2000  we still don  t have the flu vaccine production and distribution infrastructure we need to ensure a stable supply and demand for seasonal flu vaccine  raising serious concerns about our ability to respond to a flu pandemic or an outbreak of avian flu     said Senator Clinton     Last fall  we witnessed senior citizens lining up for hours to obtain flu vaccine  unscrupulous distributors attempting to sell scarce vaccine to the highest bidder and millions of Americans delaying or deferring necessary flu shots   We cannot handle the threats we face today with a broken flu vaccine system   We need to act now to stop shortages of seasonal flu vaccine before they occur and make sure our vaccine infrastructure can respond to these crises               I think we learned a good lesson from Hurricane Katrina  we must be prepared at all levels to deal with a large scale public health emergency such as pandemic flu   As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Agriculture and Health  Education  Labor and Pension  HELP  Committees  I take this threat of flu pandemic very seriously and view it not only as a public health concern  but also a national security concern   I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senator Clinton today to strengthen our public health infrastructure and make sure our vaccine manufacturers have the tools necessary to produce and deliver vaccines for both seasonal and pandemic flu  Without these resources  the U S  is extremely vulnerable in the event of a future vaccine shortage or a large scale avian flu outbreak     said Senator Roberts           In the midst of last year  s flu season  one of only two suppliers of flu vaccine withdrew from the United States market  resulting in a severe flu vaccine shortage and underscoring the inadequacy of our current vaccine production and delivery capability   The flu vaccine supply last year was approximately half of the supply needed  leading to a severe breakdown in the delivery system and widespread confusion about who should receive vaccines and how to obtain them   Approximately 36 000 Americans die of the flu each year  with another 200 000 hospitalizations resulting from flu   These deaths and hospitalizations are largely preventable if we increase immunizations  create a stable vaccine market and increase public awareness of the importance of flu vaccines               The Clinton Roberts bill  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  addresses the causes of the influenza shortage by bringing increased stability to our nation  s seasonal flu vaccine market   The bill provides a framework through which our public health officials can track vaccines to ensure we have an adequate supply and to make sure high priority populations are vaccinated   The bill also provides technical assistance to companies that wish to produce vaccine domestically  and it will increase education about the importance of obtaining seasonal flu vaccines   The legislation will also strengthen the underlying public health infrastructure in order to heighten our ability to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza   The bill is supported by the Trust for America s Health  the American Public Health Association  the National Association of County and City Health Officials  the American Lung Association  and Chiron                The Influenza Vaccine Security Act      Since 2000  the nation has experienced three shortages of its annual flu vaccine supply  yet the underlying causes of this vaccine shortage remain unaddressed  Approximately 36 000 Americans die of the flu each year  and these deaths are largely preventable  The Influenza Vaccine Security Act addresses the causes of the influenza shortage by bringing increased stability to our nation  s seasonal flu vaccine market  providing a framework through which our public health officials can track vaccines  and increasing education about the importance of flu vaccines  It would also strengthen the underlying public health infrastructure in order to heighten our ability to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza         The bill contains the following provisions       Market guarantees    The bill would allow HHS  through discussions with manufacturers and based upon the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  to set annual targets for influenza vaccine production  The Secretary is authorized to engage in both stockpiling and buyback activities  and can purchase antiviral medications  Manufacturers  wholesalers and distributors wishing to participate in this buyback program must submit information to the CDC that would enable the agency to track the distribution of vaccine from the point of manufacture to the point of delivery  Manufacturers must also provide at least 12 months notice to the Secretary before purposefully discontinuing production of influenza vaccine          Regulatory assistance to manufacturers  The bill would allow the FDA to strengthen its technical assistance activities  Technical assistance grants shall be available to companies that wish to enter the U S  market with domestic based production facilities or improve their ability to remain within the U S  market  The FDA is directed to provide additional training opportunities for its employees to develop expertise in regulation in these areas          HHS would develop a regulatory roadmap to coordinate agency wide activities for the purpose of facilitating approval and distribution of vaccine during periods of emergency use authorization  including the development of a model standing order to facilitate administration of influenza vaccine to patients in long term care facilities and children  s hospitals and by home health aides       Increased research into vaccine development alternatives    The bill would provide additional financing for NIH research into alternative methods of vaccine development  like cell based cultures and a permanent flu vaccine  The National Immunization Program of the CDC shall be charged with coordination of education  outreach and communication on influenza vaccine activities of HHS  including those pertaining to increasing vaccination rates and the current state of vaccine research  as well as any other messages deemed important by the Secretary          Establishment of a vaccine tracking system  This bill would establish  within two years of the date of enactment  an electronic tracking system by which we can determine  on a county by county basis  the amount of influenza vaccine available for distribution to patients and the number of high priority patients in each county  Within four years of the date of enactment  the Centers for Disease Control shall upgrade its flu surveillance system to incorporate flu surveillance reporting mechanisms into the flu vaccine tracking system  Such a system will also assist users in accessing influenza educational materials          The CDC shall work with state and local health departments and state licensing boards to develop a registry of medical personnel who can provide services in the event of a health emergency  including a flu vaccine shortage  It shall also provide demonstration grants to health care institutions to assist them in information technology upgrades that will allow such institutions to improve their ability to report and track flu vaccine dissemination          Increased outreach and education on flu vaccine  This bill would increase education and outreach activities with the goals of improving overall rates of vaccination  achieving vaccination of all high risk individuals and full use of each season  s influenza vaccine supplies  providing information on influenza prevention  and any other influenza educational efforts deemed appropriate by the Director of the CDC          Grants shall be provided to state and local health departments to encourage them to carry out activities that increase vaccination  They will be encouraged to collaborate on these projects with health care providers  health insurance providers  health care institutions  and groups representing high priority populations       Pandemic vaccine liability    Although seasonal influenza vaccine is covered under the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program  VICP   this section of the bill would help both manufacturers and public health with liability concerns over products prepared specifically for pandemic influenza strains  The Secretary of HHS shall have the authority to designate pandemic vaccine products as qualifying technologies for liability protections for limited time periods  Health care professionals  manufacturers  distributors  and health care institutions will be deemed to be employees of the Public Health Service  with the government assuming liability for personal injury or death resulting from the manufacture  administration  or use of qualified pandemic influenza technologies  Claims shall be adjudicated under the Federal Tort Claims Act  Nothing in this section will supersede the authority of the VICP in relation to the other vaccines covered through that program  such as trivalent influenza vaccine
