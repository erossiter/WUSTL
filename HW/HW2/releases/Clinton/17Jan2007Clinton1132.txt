                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Senators Say Immediate Action is Needed to Defeat Likely Spring Offensive by Taliban Washington  DC    On the heels of a four day trip to Iraq and Afghanistan  U S  Senators Evan Bayh  D IN  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  today wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates urging him to deploy more troops to Afghanistan to maintain progress there and help the Afghans against a likely Taliban offensive in the spring              The Taliban   and its al Qaeda partner   remains a pernicious enemy  and a failure to defeat it decisively in the spring risks undermining public confidence in the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai     Bayh and Clinton wrote in their letter     It would be tragic if we fail in Afghanistan because of an unwillingness to deploy a manageable size of additional troops to aid an important and willing ally during a time of true need             In their letter  Bayh and Clinton  both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee  described meetings at which American military commanders expressed concern that there would not be enough U S  troops to fight insurgents and requested an increase of approximately 2 300 U S  troops   The Senators also highlighted the continued shortage in Intelligence  Reconnaissance and Surveillance  ISR  capabilities  including Predator unmanned aerial vehicles  and the importance of helping a country that has proven to be a willing partner in the fight against terrorism            Unlike in Iraq  we have a government in Afghanistan committed to promoting national interests over sectarian ones  is making tangible progress in governance  sincerely wants more U S  help  and is fighting the enemy that brought us September 11th     Bayh and Clinton wrote          During their recent trip to Afghanistan  Bayh and Clinton attended a lunch hosted by Afghanistan  s President Hamid Karzai and later met in Lahore  Pakistan  with General Pervez Musharraf  the President of Pakistan   In Afghanistan  they also met with Major General Benjamin Freakley  Commanding General of the 10th Mountain Division and Fort Drum  had breakfast with U S  troops at Bagram Airbase  and visited with U S  troops stationed at Camp Eggers   In addition  Bayh and Clinton met with U S  Ambassador Ronald Neumann and Lieutenant General Karl Eikenberry  commander of Combined Forces Command    Afghanistan          The full text of the letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates follows           January 17  2006      The Honorable Robert Gates  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Washington  D C  20301    Dear Mr  Secretary       We recently returned from an important fact finding trip to Iraq  Afghanistan and Pakistan   Our trip has been extraordinarily useful in helping us assess the situation on the ground in each country and in giving us another opportunity to thank the brave men and women of the United States military for their service   While we hope to soon discuss with you our impressions of the deteriorating situation in Iraq  we write this letter now  and with utmost urgency  about the need to expand our stabilization presence and increase the number of U S  troops in Afghanistan before the likely Taliban offensive in the spring          In our discussions with commanders in Afghanistan  they explained to us that they expect a large offensive by the Taliban in southern Afghanistan this spring and the urgency of a decisive victory against the Taliban and its supporters   The commanders expressed their concern that there would not be enough U S  troops to conduct all necessary counter insurgency operations in the already volatile south and east of the country   Specifically  the commanders told us there is an urgent need to maintain and then expand our presence in Afghanistan by two infantry battalions  and possibly a third battalion for a total commitment of approximately 2 300 troops   We understand one way this can be accomplished is by having one battalion stay in country longer  and having at least one other battalion prepared to be sent to the field immediately   A third battalion would be ready for deployment should the situation so warrant          The Taliban   and its al Qaeda partner   remains a pernicious enemy  and a failure to defeat it decisively in the spring risks undermining public confidence in the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai    It would be tragic if we fail in Afghanistan because of an unwillingness to deploy a manageable size of additional troops to aid an important and willing ally during a time of true need          We also were told by the commanders that there is an overall shortage of Intelligence  Reconnaissance and Surveillance  ISR  capabilities in Afghanistan   In particular  the commanders told us they need more Predator unmanned aerial vehicles   More than five years after 9 11  this is unacceptable           Unlike in Iraq  we have a government in Afghanistan committed to promoting national interests over sectarian ones  is making tangible progress in governance  sincerely wants more U S  help  and is fighting the enemy that brought us September 11              We know that you share our goal of defending the nation against radical extremism and terrorism   It is in this context that we respectfully ask that the commanders   requirements in Afghanistan be met  and that this happen with the highest urgency             Thank you for your consideration           Sincerely       Evan Bayh  Hillary Rodham Clinton       Read Senator Clinton s trip report from Iraq and Afghanistan
