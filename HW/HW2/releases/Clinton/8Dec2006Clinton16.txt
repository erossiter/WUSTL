                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Lifespan Respite Act Now Goes to President s Desk to be Signed into Law                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today announced unanimous Senate approval of the Lifespan Respite Care Act   The Act provides  30 million in the first year and almost  300 million over five years for competitive grants for states and local bodies to increase the availability of respite care services for family caregivers of individuals with special needs regardless of age  The bill also promotes a coordinated system of accessible respite care at the state and federal level  The announcement comes just days after the House of Representatives passed its version of the bill sponsored by Representatives Michael Ferguson  R NJ  and Jim Langevin  D RI    The bill now goes to the President s desk to be signed into law                   As a nation  we cannot afford to ignore the struggles faced by the millions of selfless Americans who provide care for a family member with a chronic illness or disability   This legislation will make a real difference in the lives of millions of Americans and I am proud that we have made this important step forward for caregivers and their families     said Senator Clinton          Although much of family caregiving is unpaid  it is not without cost  Family caregivers provide about 80 percent of all long term care in the US at a value estimated at over  300 billion annually  Food  medicines and other caregiving necessities place added strain on already tight family budgets  Also  it is difficult for caregivers to find or maintain jobs because of their responsibilities at home  which can make it a struggle to stay afloat   This bill will help alleviate this financial burden            Each year  44 million Americans care for an adult family member who has a chronic illness or disability  Nearly four million Americans of all ages  who have mental retardation or another developmental disability  live with their families           Senator Clinton has worked tirelessly to address the needs of caregivers   Senator Clinton introduced the Lifespan Respite Care Act in 2002  2003 and again in 2005   Although the legislation was approved by the Senate in 2003  it failed to pass the House   Senator John Warner  R VA  became the lead co sponsor of the legislation in the 108th Congress   Senator Olympia Snowe  R ME   who has also co sponsored and championed the bill  helped secure final Senate passage    The bill has been endorsed by over 180 national and regional organizations          Click here to see the remarks Senator Clinton delivered on the Senate floor praising the passage the Lifespan Respite Care Act  Below is the text of her remarks          I am very proud that we are finally able to reach agreement on the Lifespan Respite Care Act and send it to the President for his signature   This has been a bipartisan effort from the very beginning  I  m grateful to Senator Warner who has made a real difference in his leadership on behalf of this bill   I  m grateful to Senator Snowe who was the first lead Republican on this legislation  who has been a champion   And I want to express my appreciation to Representatives Mike Ferguson  as the primary sponsor of the House bill  as well as Congressman Jim Langevin   We would not be here on the verge of enacting this bill without their work   And deep appreciation is due to the Lifespan Respite Taskforce  a coalition of 180 national  state and local organizations  under the leadership and direction of the National Respite Coalition  A special thanks to Jill Kagan of the National Respite Coalition for her leadership and invaluable assistance           As Senator Enzi said  this bill represents a tremendous acknowledgement of the families who are caring for their loved ones  for ailing seniors  for children with disabilities  for a spouse who  s been incapacitated by accident or chronic condition   Family members provide most of the support and the time consuming physical labor and the emotionally exhausting input that really makes it possible to keep people at home   Each year  44 million Americans care for an adult family member who has a chronic illness or disability   Almost four million Americans with developmental disabilities  of all ages  live at home with their families   And Senator Coburn and I were talking earlier today  this is such a human issue that affects the lives and the fortunes and the feelings of so many of our fellow Americans           What this legislation does is to expand and enhance access to respite care services   What are those   Those are to give that wife who is caring for her ailing husband a few hours off a week  Those are for that father who devotes himself to his child with disability to have someplace to go to get a little bit of respite while his child is still well cared for  Family caregivers provide 80 percent of all long term care in the United States  But as Senator Coburn and I were discussing  you don  t get real financial help unless you put your loved one in a nursing home  There is something wrong with that  That doesn  t reflect our deepest values  And the work that our loved ones do for all of us is unpaid  but valued at more than  300 billion a year  That  s more than the entire amount of money we spent on Medicare in 2004           So today  our Congress is sending a message to family caregivers  We recognize  we honor your commitment and in many instances  your sacrifice           We know that because of this care  many caregivers can  t keep their jobs  It becomes too much of a burden  They struggle to stay afloat  They start selling off assets  This is a labor of love that often undermines the health of the very people who are providing it  We found that many caregivers suffer physical symptoms  sleeplessness  depression  they feel like they  re all alone  And this incredible struggle is one that we will see more and more of in our country because of our aging population   So I  m grateful that we  re going to be passing this legislation and giving some assistance to these courageous men and women  these parents  these children  these grandparents  these spouses           We also in the new Congress  something else I have talked to Senator Coburn about  we can address this issue of caregiving  particularly how to rearrange the incentives within our healthcare system  particularly through Medicaid where 80 percent of the money is spent on 20 percent of the recipients and that  s mostly for long term nursing care at the end of life  Many people would rather be home or rather be in a less restrictive setting  And if this is a statement of our concern  we need to follow that up            This will provide what has been missing  improved coordination at the local level of services  helping families understand more about how to shoulder these burdens  It is critical that HHS ensures that we serve all age groups  all disability categories without preference and that we begin to not just honor the love that we see and the sacrifice that is too often accompanying it  but really provide some support           So I am deeply appreciative of all who have worked over the last years to make this legislation possible and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to address these long term needs  how to help people stay at home  how to support families who are doing the most important work there is
