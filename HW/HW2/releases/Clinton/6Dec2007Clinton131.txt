December 6  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Vote on Alternative Minimum Tax                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC  Providing relief from the alternative minimum tax is critically important for our middle class families who are already burdened with stagnant incomes and skyrocketing costs for health care  energy and college   That is why I support the effort to ensure that more middle class families do not get hit with a stealth tax from the AMT next year that was never meant to apply to them    At the same time  it is profoundly unfortunate that the Republican leadership held AMT relief for 23 million Americans hostage to their fiscal irresponsibility  After overseeing the largest fiscal deterioration in history and after ushering in another  3 trillion to the national debt  the Republicans have yet again chosen to abandon any semblance of fiscal responsibility and rejected the good faith efforts of the Democratic leadership to provide AMT relief for the middle class while ensuring that it would not add to the deficit     I was deeply disappointed that the Republicans were all too willing to gamble with AMT relief for more than 23 million more American households in order to continue their fiscally irresponsible approach   But I do not believe that those 23 million families should pay the price for the Republican leaderships irresponsibility   That is why I support the Democratic leaderships effort to pass an AMT fix  Nevertheless  the failure to offset the cost of this much needed and necessary AMT relief is a missed opportunity  and yet another example of the misplaced priorities of the Republican leadership
