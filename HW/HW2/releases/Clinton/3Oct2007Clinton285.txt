October 3  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on President s Veto of Health Insurance for Nearly Four Million Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              With the stroke of a pen  President Bush has robbed nearly four million uninsured children of the chance for a healthy start in life and the health coverage they need but can t afford  These children are invisible to this president  but they aren t invisible to the American people or to the overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress  and they aren t invisible to me     I was proud to help create the Children s Health Insurance Program during the Clinton Administration  which today provides health insurance for six million children  In New York alone  almost 400 000 children benefit from CHIP every month  The president s veto today stopped us from insuring an additional 3 8 million children  including 72 000 more children in New York    I will continue to fight to provide health insurance to all children  as I have proposed in the Senate  and to pursue quality  affordable health care for all Americans  No child should be invisible in our country or in our health care system
