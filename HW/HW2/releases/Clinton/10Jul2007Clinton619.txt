July 10  2007 Clinton Calls on Secretary Michael Chertoff to Explain Inadequate Homeland Security Funding for New York City and Long Island                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator will Raise Concerns about Homeland Security Funding at a Neeting with Chertoff this Week   Recent Figures Show Department of Homeland Security Still Does Not Take Threats Against New York Seriously                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC  In anticipation of a meeting with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff this Thursday  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Secretary to explain the Departments reasoning behind the continual short changing of the New York metropolitan area when it comes to national homeland security funding  This year  New York will receive  134 million  which represents a 7 7  increase from last years funding but is far short of the  207 million it received in 2005   Senator Clinton emphasized that New York continues to be a top terrorist target and this repeated under funding threatens New York s ability to maintain its necessary high level of vigilance      I am shocked at the Department of Homeland Securitys continual disregard for the level of threat that New York is under and very disappointed that the Department still has not learned from its past mistakes on this critical issue  I am meeting with the Secretary on Thursday in the hopes that he will be forthcoming about why his department appears to be so blind to the threats facing the area and to express my very serious hopes that these reported figures do not reflect the actual amounts that New York will receive from the federal government  said Senator Clinton     Recent reports indicate that the New York metropolitan area  which includes New York City as well as Nassau and Suffolk counties  will receive  134 million from the Department of Homeland Security under its Urban Area Security Initiative grant program for 2007  which represents a 7 7  increase over the  124 million awarded in 2006  but is still nowhere near the  207 million received in 2005  An announcement on the final amount is expected from the Department of Homeland Security shortly     Last year  Senator Clinton  along with Congressman Peter King  forced that Department of Homeland Security to reverse their massive cuts to homeland security funding for New York despite the fact that no state has been more affected by terrorism or is a greater target of a potential terrorist attack  Clinton and King questioned how the Department of Homeland Security could possibly claim that New York has only four places of national financial significance and no national monuments and icons and launched a postcard program urging New Yorkers to send Secretary Chertoff postcards of New York landmarks to remind the Secretary of the state s highly visible and recognizable icons and landmarks  and encouraged New Yorkers to follow suit   See   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id

Secretary    In advance of our meeting this week to discuss the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   I am writing to alert you that I intend to raise with you my concerns related to the disturbing reports that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  in its latest round of homeland security grants plans to only minimally increase the New York City Regions Homeland Security Grant funding for Fiscal Year 2007   Of particular concern is news that DHS will allocate only  134 million in Urban Areas Security Initiative  UASI  funding to New York City  a mere 7 7 percent increase from last years inadequate and dramatically reduced funding level      Last year the New York City region received  124 5 million under the UASI program  a 40 percent reduction from the allocation the region received in FY 2005   At the time  the Department stated that the regions application contained numerous flaws and as a result  poor grades were given to the application   The notion that the quality of a grant application somehow lessens the threat that the New York City Region faces is absurd   More disturbing was the Departments explanation that the New York City region lacked significant national monuments or icons     In the Conference Report that accompanied the FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Act  P L  109 295   it states that the Department should continue its efforts to evaluate UASI grant applications on the basis of risk and on how effectively these grants will address identified homeland security needs   The report goes on to state that in those areas where the risk is very high  the Department shall work aggressively to ensure these applications are produced in a manner in which appropriate levels of funding reflect the level of threat   Working under the assumption that the Department followed the instructions outlined in the FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Act  what is the explanation for the modest increase in homeland security funds for the New York City area   The Act also required the Department to announce these grants allocations by May 16  2007   If the recently reported figures  which are nearly two months after the deadline  are inaccurate  I hope that the Department corrects this error and allocates the funding needed by New York City and the surrounding region    You have repeatedly stated that homeland security funding should be targeted to the most at risk areas of the country   This was one of chief recommendations of the 9 11 Commission   As you well know  New York City is an area where the risk is particularly high   The recent threats and attacks in London and Glasgow indicate that the threat of attack is still ever present and that large urban areas continue to be most at risk   However  the Departments allocation to the New York City region last year and the proposed allocation for FY 2007  are wholly inconsistent with the threats the New York City region continues to face  as well as the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission    I look forward to our meeting this week and to your response to the questions and concerns that I have raised    Sincerely yours  Hillary Rodham Clinton
