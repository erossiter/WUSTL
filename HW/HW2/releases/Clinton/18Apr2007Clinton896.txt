April 18  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Federal Railroad Administration Investigation of New York s CSX Railroad Tracks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Today s report of 79 defects and yet another violation are deeply concerning and CSX must comply with track safety standards   I am pleased that Administrator Boardman has conducted this investigation but this report only underscores the urgent need for the Federal Railroad Administration to undertake a comprehensive investigation of all of New York s rail tracks and I trust that Administrator Boardman will make good on his commitment to do so   This report also underscores the very real need to make sure track safety standards are enforced   The derailments we have seen and the reports of defects and violations only deepen my concern that the Federal Railroad Administration has the resources it needs to ensure rail safety and the authority needed to hold railroads accountable
