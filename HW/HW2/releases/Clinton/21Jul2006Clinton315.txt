                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Bill Provides Important New Protections for Americans   Personal Information  Establishes a Privacy Bill of Rights for all Consumers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    With nearly constant revelations of serious breaches of Americans   most sensitive personal information  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today introduced comprehensive legislation to give Americans important new consumer privacy protections  strong data security rulesand establishes a comprehensive Privacy Bill of Rights   The Privacy Rights and Oversigh T  for Electronic and Commercial Transactions Act of 2006  the PROTECT Act  is an important step toward addressing the challenges of privacy in our increasingly data driven economy and world   Senator Clinton announced her intent to introduce the bill in a major policy address on privacy last month            We cannot stand by while Americans every day are seeing their most personal information compromised by lax and outdated privacy and security standards   Consumers have the right to clear privacy standards and strong protections for their most sensitive information   We need to act to bring consumer protections up to date with the realities of our time     said Senator Clinton     The PROTECT Act is about empowering consumers and gives them a say in how companies buy  sell and market their private data  while entitling them to effective security protections              According to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse  since February of last year  nearly 89 million Americans have had their most sensitive data exposed through theft  computer hacking and simple negligence and identity theft remains one of the fastest growing crimes according the to Federal Trade Commission           Overview of the PROTECT Act         Senator Clinton  s bill enacts a Privacy Bill of Rights that ensures three essential consumer protections               People have the right to know  and to correct  information which is being kept about them              People have the right to know what is happening to their personal information when they are cooperating with a business and to make decisions about how it is used             And in a democracy  people have the right and the obligation to hold their government and the private sector to the highest standards of care with the information they gather           Senator Clinton  s legislation ensures that these rights are basic to all of the consumer transactions we undertake and are adhered to by every commercial information gatherer or marketer          Specifically  the PROTECT Act ensures consumers have the       Right to Clear Protections of Consumers   Most Private Information   Senator Clinton  s bill ensures that for the most deeply personal information about where we shop  what we buy and how we spend our money on a daily basis  consumer information will be shared only when consumers  specifically agree to the practice or   opt in            Right to Sue and Seek Damages Against Negligent Data Handlers   Currently  there is no set definition of what privacy violations cost the individual and little incentive for businesses in many instances to protect personal data with the highest level of security   As a result  it is very hard for individuals to seek redress through the courts   Senator Clinton  s bill creates a tiered system of damages  exempting the smallest businesses with set minimums of  1000 for breaches and  5000 for actual misuse of information to hold businesses that are negligent in the handling of personal data accountable       Right to Protect Phone Records   Right now  it  s too easy to purchase  post or trade cell phone numbers and records   Buying and selling that kind of information is a gross invasion of privacy but it is not clear that it is a crime   This will only get more challenging as more consumers move to phone service based new technologies such as broadband and satellite service for which no regulations currently exist   Senator Clinton  s legislation ensures that all of the appropriate federal regulatory and law enforcement agencies coordinate their oversight and enforcement efforts  ensuring that consumers   private phone numbers and call records remain private and a step ahead of data thieves        Right to Freeze Personal Credit   Right now  consumers that are victimized can place a credit   alert     but they cannot freeze their credit   Senator Clinton  s bill allows consumers who are concerned about third party access to their credit history to contact credit agencies and say    no access and no new credit          Right to the Full Disclosure of Any Data Breach of Personally Identifiable Information   Senator Clinton  s bill requires that consumers are notified immediately if their credit or identity is compromised   Notification is currently required in some states but not all   As a result  many identity theft victims are unaware even years later that their information has been put at risk           Right to Know When Your Data Leaves the United States   Some firms are sending data abroad for processing to countries with few or lax privacy and security standards and away from the protections of U S  law   Senator Clinton  s bill requires that consumers be notified when their personal data is sent abroad and gives them the right to   opt out    if they aren  t satisfied with the level of privacy security        Right to Automatic Free Credit Reports   Because the information included in a consumer credit report will determine whether you  re able to buy a house  finance a new car or even secure a job  consumers should have credit information provided to them once each year without paying a fee or jumping through hoops   Senator Clinton  s bill makes this a standard practice       Right to Access Consumer Profiles Kept By Financial Institutions   If companies maintain consumer profiles on their customers  people should have the ability to obtain a free copy of that report each year       Right to High Standards from Government   The PROTECT Act creates a high level privacy czar in the White House to create accountability and establish strong data security protections   This Chief Privacy Officer for our government would have oversight into the workings of every government department and the power to make sure the law is being followed and best practices are being implemented        Right to Medical Privacy   The PROTECT ACT recognizes that privacy is essential to ensure effective  high quality health care   Consumers have a right to strong health information privacy protections that will be enforced  including the right to informed consent   As technology expands and medical information is more widely available  we need to make sure medical privacy protections keep up by ensuring one set of high standards for everyone who deals with healthcare information   Senator Clinton  s bill also puts real teeth in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA  to make sure companies comply with the law and that those who violate it are held accountable
