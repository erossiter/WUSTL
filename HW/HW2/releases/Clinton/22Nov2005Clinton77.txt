November 22  2005 Joint Statement by Senator Hillary Clinton And Senator Chuck Schumer On Federal Aid For 9 11 Injured Responders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  WASHINGTON  DC    We are grateful that the Speaker of the House recognizes the outstanding needs that exist for  125 million in funds previously appropriated to New York to respond to the attacks of September 11th  As we wrote to the Appropriations Committee on November 2  we believe that this funding should be restored in whatever emergency spending vehicle is moving through Congress   It appears that Speaker Hastert agrees with that as well and we commend Mr  Fossella  and our other partners from New York s House Delegation  for their work on this important issue  The Senate passed an Amendment in October that would have restored this funding and thanks to the hard work of the Fire Department of New York  New York City Police Foundation  Uniformed Firefighters Association  Uniformed Fire Officers Association  the State Federation of Labor AFL CIO  AFSCME  Mt  Sinai Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine  and the Mayor of New York City and Governor of New York  we are one step closer to getting this money secured for our firefighters  police officers  workers  first responders  and other volunteers whose efforts will never be forgotten  The most important thing is that this money is one step closer to being restored to New York which would ensure the commitments made by the President and Congress are not broken  We welcome this good news and look forward to continuing to work with the entire New York delegation to make sure this money remains in New York
