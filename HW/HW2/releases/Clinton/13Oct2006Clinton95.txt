October 13  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on FAA Announcement Barring Fixed Wing Aircraft Along the East River                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Earlier today I wrote to the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  urging an immediate and thorough review of the airspace in and around New York City as a result of the crash that occurred on East 72nd Street   Today  the FAA announced a restriction on fixed wing aircraft operations along the East River which would require pilots to be in contact with air traffic controllers if they desire to fly in the area   That is not a current requirement under existing flight rules   While this is a good preliminary step  it does not address fully the larger safety and security concerns associated with the operation of general aviation aircraft in the New York City region  including whether other restrictions need to be imposed along the Hudson and East Rivers  I expect the FAA to move forward with a more comprehensive review of the entire airspace in and around New York City and to make additional changes and recommendations as determined to be needed by the experts       Click here to read Senator Clinton s letter to the FAA    Click here to read Senator Clinton s statement concerning the Tragic Plane Crash in New York City
