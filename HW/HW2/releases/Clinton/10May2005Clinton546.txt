May 10  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  on the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations  Conference Report and Real ID Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill is supposed to provide funding for the young men and women wearing the uniform of our country who find themselves in harm s way every single hour of every single day  It will command broad bipartisan support and public support  as it should  But  unfortunately  the Senate was handed this bill as a fait accompli with no orderly budget process and no chance of serious  thoughtful debate         For the third year in a row  we are providing military funding not through the regular budget process where we can discuss needs and provide oversight  but through an emergency process where accountability is thrown out the window  This is particularly alarming given the news today that the Administration has not provided a proper accounting of how funds are being spent in Iraq  It is regrettable that we are making these important  literally life and death decisions once again in an emergency supplemental as opposed to the regular budget  That s not the way the budget process  and certainly not the way our democratic process  should work         I m also deeply concerned that on an emergency supplemental to fund our troops and provide disaster relief for areas devastated by the tsunami we are being asked to vote on the so called  Real ID  legislation  Its supporters say it is supposed to make our country safer  but how do we know that  We haven t had any committee hearings or any debate about it in the Senate  I had previously joined with my colleague  Senator Feinstein  on her amendment to prevent immigration proposals from being thrown needlessly into the emergency supplemental  and I am outraged that the Republican leadership in both the House and Senate decided to ignore this reasonable request and put this seriously flawed act into a bill to fund our troops  Emergency legislation designed to provide our troops with the resources they need to fight terrorism on the front lines is not the place for broad  sweeping immigration reform         I am in total agreement with those who argue that we need to address our immigration challenges and we must also recognize that we are still not doing what we should to fulfill the demands of homeland security  And these issues do go hand in hand  If we can t secure our borders  we can t secure our homeland  We need a much tougher  much smarter look at these issues  Instead  we re faced with a piece of legislation  passed by the House  jammed into an emergency supplemental bill and my Republican colleagues are going to claim that we ve made America safer  Well  that s a false claim         We need to make our borders more secure  I ve introduced legislation three years in a row to have a Northern Border Coordinator  I ve met with both Secretary Ridge and Secretary Chertoff  We don t know who s in charge of the Northern Border  We re not even taking simple steps to rationalize our bureaucracy in Washington and figure out where the holes are and how to plug them         We must continue our American tradition of welcoming immigrants who follow the rules and are trying to build a better life for their families  That s why I am so troubled by the changes in immigration  environmental and privacy laws included in this bill  I also worry about the consequences likely to occur because of changes in the asylum rules in the Real ID Act  I m proud of the fact that our country has historically welcomed asylum seekers and refugees  Utica  New York is one of the most welcoming places for refugees in the entire country  But  under these new rules  we ll see whether America remains a welcoming place for those who seek refuge from persecution and violence         We clearly have to make some tough decisions as a country  We need to ensure that people using fake ids don t cross our borders and jeopardize our homeland security  We must confirm that people who enter our country are who they purport to be  We need a system to apprehend criminals who are here illegally  And we need to develop a much better entry and exit system so that we know who is entering our country and overstaying their visas        However  a piecemeal attempt to address immigration problems window dressed as national security is not the solution  We need a thoughtful  reasonable process to address our immigration challenges and make our nation secure  This emergency bill does not provide that opportunity
