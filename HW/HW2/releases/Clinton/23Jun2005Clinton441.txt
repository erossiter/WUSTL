June 23  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  on the Announcement of New Corporation  for Public Broadcasting President                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Given that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created to insulate public broadcasters from government and politics  I am troubled by today s decision to name a partisan political operative to this important post  Last week  I wrote to Chairman Tomlinson urging that he ensure the integrity of the selection process by conducting an open and transparent search for the best possible candidate  Today s decision  made behind closed doors and out of the light of day  fails that test and threatens to undermine the fundamental mission of the organization
