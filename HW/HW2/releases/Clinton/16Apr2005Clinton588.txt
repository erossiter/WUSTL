April 16  2005 Clinton Renews Concerns Over New  U S  Border Passport Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Says any proposal must protect borders and the economic interests of New York s Northern Border communities  Calls on Rice  Chertoff to provide full details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   In a letter sent to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton renewed her concern about an Administration initiative to require passports at U S  borders  In her letter  Senator Clinton asked that they carefully review the proposed policy based on the serious concerns of New York s Northern Border communities and requested an immediate briefing on the full details of the proposal         In a report today in The Washington Post  President George W  Bush expressed surprise that U S  citizens would be required to show a passport and has directed that a review of the initiative be undertaken to determine whether there are alternatives  While President Bush reportedly referred to the large number of crossings that would be affected in his home state of Texas  I can attest to the equally profound impact that would take place in New York   Senator Clinton wrote in her letter         National security and  in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount and I have made security at New York s northern border a top priority since joining the Senate  However  it is crucial that any new requirement be sensitive to the potentially serious impact of this proposal on tourism and the regional economy  I would urge that your departments consider this proposal very carefully and take into account the very real concerns of the business and residential communities along New York s Northern Border   Senator Clinton wrote          Based on the immediate and dramatic response of New Yorkers to the announcement of your initiative  it is imperative that your departments listen closely to the voices of my constituents and consider all feasible alternatives that will both enhance security and facilitate commerce   Senator Clinton continued   I would appreciate a response as soon as possible and respectfully request an immediate briefing for my staff on the full details of your proposed initiative           A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is attached        April 15  2005       The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  United States Department of State  2201 C Street  N W   Washington  D C  20520       The Honorable Michael Chertoff   Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C  20528 0001       Dear Madam Secretary and Mr  Secretary        I write to express my concerns with respect to the April 5  2005  announcement by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State that would require United States and Canadian citizens to utilize a passport to enter the U S  from Canada        According to the April 5  2005 State Department announcement  the Departments of State and Homeland Security are pursuing a  Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  that would  require all U S  citizens  Canadians  citizens of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda  and citizens of Mexico to have a passport or other accepted secure document to enter or re enter the U S  by January 1  2008   The media note also states that other documents may be determined to be acceptable  including  the Customs and Border Protection Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection  SENTRI   NEXUS and Free and Secure Trade  FAST  program cards         In a report today in The Washington Post  President George W  Bush expressed surprise that U S  citizens would be required to show a passport and has directed that a review of the initiative be undertaken to determine whether there are alternatives  While President Bush reportedly referred to the large number of crossings that would be affected in his home state of Texas  I can attest to the equally profound impact that would take place in New York        National security and  in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount and I have made security at New York s northern border a top priority since joining the Senate  However  it is crucial that any new requirement be sensitive to the potentially serious impact of this proposal on tourism and the regional economy  I would urge that your departments consider this proposal very carefully and take into account the very real concerns of the business and residential communities along New York s Northern Border        According to the Buffalo Niagara Partnership  Partnership   representing nearly 3 000 employer members  a passport for entry to the U S   will devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border   The Partnership notes that  in 2003  there were 3 8 million visits from Canadians to New York State  an increase of 70  over 2002  Those Canadians spent over  392 Million  US  in  New York  Moreover   major tourism developments  such as the over  100 million Bass Pro Project in Buffalo  are being planned based  in part  on the substantial buying power of Canadians in Metro Toronto and Southern Ontario  The Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres are dependent upon ticket sales to fans from Southern Ontario who have the option of watching the games on television rather than in person         The North Country of New York would also feel a profound impact  According to the Plattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce and its thousands of members   to require passports  or NEXUS cards where available  for U S  and Canadian citizens to cross the U S  Canadian border      will substantially discourage crossborder travel  and  will depress travel and economic benefit  for both nations        I remain committed to fighting for the resources necessary to make our Northern Border as secure as possible while at the same time protecting the commercial  tourist and personal traffic that is so important to New York s Northern Border Communities        To begin with  we must ensure that the offices at the border are adequately funded to provide ample staffing and to implement technological advances at the earliest possible time  The Northern Border has traditionally not received enough federal resources or attention  I have long urged the appointment of a Northern Border Coordinator who would have primary responsibility for northern border issues  Through large annual increases in border patrol agents and other initiatives  I am convinced that it is possible to enhance border security  while facilitating the binational trade and tourism between Canada and the U S  that so many of my constituents depend on for their livelihood        Based on the immediate and dramatic response of New Yorkers to the announcement of your initiative  it is imperative that your departments listen closely to the voices of my constituents and consider all feasible alternatives that will both enhance security and facilitate commerce        I would appreciate a response as soon as possible and respectfully request an immediate briefing for my staff on the full details of your proposed initiative        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
