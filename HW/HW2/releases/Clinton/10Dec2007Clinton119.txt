December 10  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on President Bush to Address Delays in Social Security Disability Insurance Benefit Determinations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today sent the following letter to President Bush urging him to address delays in benefit determinations affecting hundreds of thousands of applicants for Social Security Disability Insurance  SSDI     December 10  2007   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    Over the last several years  I have called for adequate funding for the Social Security Administration and the critical work they perform  including eligibility determinations for the Social Security Disability Insurance  SSDI  program   Currently it can take as long as four years for an applicant for disability benefits to have his or her application approved   In fact  wait times for those seeking an appeal from their initial benefit determination have shot up from 250 days in 2000 to more than 500 days in 2007   Since 2000  SSDI backlogs have soared  from more than 300 000 to more than 750 000 cases awaiting an appeals hearing   Backlogs for initial claims are greater than 575 000 cases  During these extended waiting periods  many of these disabled applicants have no earnings  placing significant financial strain on them and their families         Recent news reports regarding these backlogs and unacceptably long wait times for applicants only reinforce the grave need to address this problem   The heartbreaking stories of individuals losing their homes  falling into bankruptcy and even dying before receiving a benefit determination should compel us to action  Unfortunately  your recent veto of  275 million in additional funding for the SSA as part of the Labor HHS appropriations bill signals an unacceptable willingness on the part of your Administration to let this problem continue to grow  Even your current Social Security Commissioner acknowledges that increasing the number of judges to hear these appeals to 1 200 would require at least  100 million beyond your FY 2008 budget request      These families and their grave needs should not be held hostage by continued veto threats  Last week  I joined a number of my colleagues in a letter to Senate appropriators urging them to include an increase in funding equal to the one included in the bill you vetoed   I urge you to reconsider your veto threat and make it immediately clear that you support the needed funding increase for SSA and will sign into law the appropriations legislation that Congress is currently drafting   These delays are an unconscionable burden on too many American families  and I hope you will act in their interest to clear the backlog in the SSDI program  Sincerely  Hillary Rodham Clinton
