May 13  2005 Senator Clinton Announces  8 Million Authorization for Defense Project to Protect Bridges  Tunnels and Pipelines Against the Threat of Terrorism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Funding included in Department of Defense Authorization  Bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized  8 million for a defense project that will look at retrofitting our nation s bridges  tunnels  pipelines and other infrastructure to protect them against potential terrorist attacks  The work will be done by a Weidlinger Associates  a New York company        The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2006 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill  The bill now goes to the Senate for approval         The best defense is a strong offense which is why we must ensure that our nation s bridges and tunnels are protected from a potential terrorist threat    Senator Clinton said   I am pleased that a New York company is going to make a major contribution to this critical project         Weidlinger Associates    Defense Against Explosive Effects   8 Million  Terrorist events against United States  interests abroad  and at home  underscore the need to protect bridges  tunnels  pipelines  and other infrastructure elements against explosive attacks  Stability operations to counter such events require the establishment  maintenance  and security of critical infrastructure elements  Unfortunately  design engineers lack the basic structural response data for retrofit and new construction for these unique and important structures  Current protective design approaches are deficient and lack applicability to these high value targets         Weidlinger Associates will take a lead in this program to close existing gaps and develop protection guidelines  Full scale field testing is essential to develop the necessary baseline data to validate analytical techniques upon which retrofit solutions will be implemented  An important result of this comprehensive national program is to develop robust modeling and analysis tools for military and civilian structural engineers  As an added benefit  the data developed will ensure that billions of federal and state dollars being appropriated to protect our nation s infrastructure are effectively spent  This will help assure the mobility of troops and supplies in support of U S  Northern Command  NORTHCOM  and National Guard operations
