April 17  2006 Clinton Calls On Colleagues To Protect Middle Income New Yorkers From Alternative Minimum Tax                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Without a Fix From Congress  AMT Could Impact Up To 2 9 million New Yorkers in the 2006 Tax Year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    As millions of working families across America file their tax returns  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on Senate leaders to protect middle income families from the impact of the Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT   which could hit up to 2 9 million New Yorkers in the 2006 tax year  In a letter to Senator Charles Grassley  Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance  Senator Clinton urged him to support a Senate backed temporary fix to reduce the impact of the AMT in the Tax Reconciliation bill currently under negotiation between the House and the Senate             New York already has the second highest percentage of AMT taxpayers in the country and without an adjustment  millions of middle class households will see their tax burdens suddenly increase     Senator Clinton said    If nothing is done to fix this situation  nearly 2 9 million hard working New Yorkers will be hit by the AMT in the 2006 tax year  While there is no doubt that we need to look at a long term  fiscally responsible approach to fixing the AMT  we cannot place this kind of sudden  added burden on middle income taxpayers             Senator Clinton believes that it should be Congress  s top tax priority to address the AMT for the middle class  Over the last several years  she has supported the   hold harmless    fixes to ensure that more middle income households are not affected by the AMT          While both the House and Senate versions of the Tax Reconciliation bill contained temporary fixes to the AMT situation  in her letter to Senator Grassley  Senator Clinton said she believed that  though not perfect  the Senate  s version better reflects the priorities of working families and should be mirrored in the final version of the bill currently under negotiation by the House and Senate Conference Committee          Read Senator Clinton  s letter below            April 17  2006         The Honorable Charles Grassley  Chairman  United States Senate Committee on Finance  135 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  D C  20510      Dear Chairman Grassley           As you continue the negotiations on the Tax Reconciliation bill  I would like to reiterate my strong support for the inclusion of a true   hold harmless    Alternative Minimum Tax  AMT  fix in whatever bill is reported out of the conference committee            The AMT relief provision included in the Senate passed tax bill  which I supported  would ensure that as few families as possible lapsed into AMT liability   I am concerned that the AMT provision being proposed by the House conferees would leave as many as 600 000 more families exposed to the AMT for the 2006 tax year   I would urge you to continue to reject that provision and insist on the AMT relief that passed the Senate   As you know  the AMT is a growing problem for many working families throughout the United States   In my state of New York as many as 2 9 million households for the 2006 tax year will be subject to the AMT if nothing is done to fix it now   We should take every action to prevent this stealth tax from hitting middle class families in New York and throughout the country   Therefore  I believe that AMT relief should be Congress   top tax priority           Clearly  AMT relief is a higher priority than the extension of the capital gains and dividend tax cuts  which are not scheduled to expire until the beginning of 2009   In fact  the Senate was able to achieve a bipartisan consensus when it rejected the inclusion of the capital gains and dividend tax cut extensions in its tax bill and included a strong AMT relief provision  the extension of the college tuition tax deduction  the extension of the research and development tax credit and increased IRA contributions among other important provisions   The Senate tax bill  while not perfect  reflected the priorities of working families and the final bill should be similar in its priorities           While I hope to work with you on addressing a long term solution to the AMT problem  I would hope that as we move forward  with an ever watchful eye on the deficit and exploding debt  that we use our resources as prudently and practically as possible   This would mean  addressing the AMT relief provisions first  and leaving further capital gains and dividend tax cuts out of this tax bill                      Thank you for your attention to these issues           Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
