June 22  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Secretary Chertoff s Visit to Buffalo on Monday                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Given the Secretarys apparent failure to understand the needs of our Northern Border communities  I hope that during his tour of Buffalo and the Peace Bridge  he decides to provide us with a real  constructive plan that addresses the economic concerns of the region without compromising our security  We need a better option that protects our borders while acknowledging the very real needs of businesses and residents along the border   After nearly three years of keeping everyone in limbo over Shared Border Management  the Secretary can no longer ignore our Northern Border
