August 11  2007 Clinton Calls on President Bush   Defense Secretary Gates to Clarify Administration Policy on Resuming the Military Draft  and Affirm Their Commitment to an All volunteer Force                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Comes in Light of White House Official Declaring that the Draft is  an option on the table                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President George Bush and Defense Secretary Robert Gates to clarify the Administration s position on re instituting the military draft  in light of White House Deputy National Security Adviser Lt  Gen  Douglas Lute saying yesterday that the draft has always been an option on the table   which contradicts previously stated Administration policy    Our volunteer military  is the best in the world and has been performing heroically under difficult circumstances  Clinton said  While our force is under strain  a draft is not the answer   I call upon President Bush and Secretary Gates to clarify Gen  Lute s remarks and affirm their commitment to the all volunteer force   Rather than raising the specter of a draft  the Administration should be focusing on providing our current servicemembers with the equipment and benefits they need and deserve    Since 1973  the United States has relied on an all volunteer force    As recently as December of last year  when the Selective Service System underwent a comprehensive Readiness test  the White House reiterated its position opposing re instituting the draft    General Lute though  tasked with coordinating White House policy on the wars in Iraq  Afghanistan  has now cast that opposition in doubt by saying that a military draft is an option on the table  and the President and Secretary of Defense need to clarify his remarks  and clearly state the current position of the Administration
