July 11  2005 Senator Clinton joins University of Rochester Medical Center and Johnson   Johnson to Announce Research Partnership                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Rochester  NY A unique fund to nurture research and technologies that have the potential to lead to new health care products is being established at the University of Rochester Medical Center through a partnership with Johnson   Johnson   The Medical Center today announced that a   Discovery Concept Fund    is being created to target promising early stage research generally conducted by junior scientists who have ideas but often do not have ready access to funding             World class biomedical research institutions  such as the University of Rochester Medical Center  are engines of innovation     said Ted Torphy  corporate vice president for science and technology at Johnson   Johnson    The objective of this partnership is to both support this process of discovery and accelerate the translation of research into products for patients   We believe long term collaborative partnerships between the academic and the private sector will be increasingly important in advancing breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of serious disease  We share the same fundamental goal of bringing better treatment to patients               This partnership comes at a time when the University of Rochester Medical Center and other biomedical research institutions are facing significant funding challenges   While the Medical Center has doubled its total research funding over the last seven years to  210 million   142 million of which came from the National Institutes of Health  NIH   the rate of growth has decelerated in recent years due to the leveling off of the NIH budget             The Medical Center has made an enormous investment in recent years to expand our research capabilities     said David Guzick  M D   Ph D  dean of the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry    As we look to the future  we are compelled to seek out private sources of revenue which will enable us to grow our biomedical research enterprises   This partnership will also help us better utilize the talents of our faculty and our research infrastructure to translate innovative discoveries into useful technologies and treatments that can be used by patients around the world                An example of the potential of this partnership was on display today as it was separately announced that the Medical Center and Johnson   Johnson were moving forward on a  1 6 million joint research project   This project will utilize a process developed by Howard Federoff  M D   Ph D  senior associated dean for basic science research at the Medical Center  which can target activity in neurons that prevent the repair of the central nervous system following spinal cord injury or trauma to the brain   This application of this process also has the potential to lead to the development of new classes of drugs             I want to congratulate University of Rochester Medical Center and Johnson   Johnson on this partnership announcement and on the creation of the Discovery Concept Fund  This is an incredible gift  not only to UMRC  but to the entire biomedical research community and to the Greater Rochester region     said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  who joined with officials from the University of Rochester Medical Center and Johnson   Johnson for today  s announcement    It is also a great example of what we can achieve when academia and industry work together   further enhancing Rochester s reputation as a world class center for biotechnology research  fostering a new generation of scientists and building on the region s growth potential  I look forward to watching this winning partnership thrive          Discovery Concept Fund    The Discovery Concept Fund will be jointly administered by Johnson   Johnson and the University of Rochester Medical Center and will be funded on a renewable basis by Johnson   Johnson              Johnson   Johnson is committed to supporting biomedical institutions  as demonstrated by the  50 million in grants we have awarded researchers in the last twenty years     said Torphy    The University of Rochester Medical Center is one of a few select partners for the Discovery Concept Fund   Based on the quality of their science and an environment for collaboration and entrepreneurship  the only limit in our relationship that I can see will be the amount of innovation that its scientists can produce              The fund will solicit proposals from Medical Center scientists with the objective of nurturing early stage research and technologies that have the potential to impact health care   In doing so  it will target researchers  particularly junior scientists  who often have difficulty competing with their more established colleagues for research grants  Johnson   Johnson has stated that it will not limit the number of meritorious applications it will fund             This agreement is truly mutually beneficial     said Guzick    A major problem faced by industry is access to new concepts or novel approaches that lay the foundation for new medical breakthroughs  On the flip side  scientists who have a concept or idea that could provide a solution to a specific problem often lack funding to evaluate and advance their research              The fund will be governed by a committee consisting of equal members from both the Medical Center and Johnson   Johnson  The committee will oversee the administration of the fund including the solicitation  evaluation and funding of research proposals  Awards will consist of what is termed   no rights    grants  In other words  Johnson   Johnson will have no special rights to any discoveries or patents that arise from research supported by the agreement  All intellectual property rights to the discoveries will be retained by the Medical Center and its inventors
