                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator Clinton  Foodlink And Others Launch Major Initiative To Expand Markets For New York  s Farmers And Growers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Rochester  NY  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined Foodlink   the foodbank of the Genesee Valley and Finger Lakes region   to launch the Farm to Fork Fulfillment Center partnership to facilitate the distribution of locally grown produce from at least 10 counties in the Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes region to markets in the state  s regional centers and beyond  The partnership is a result of Senator Clinton  s Farm to Fork initiative in conjunction with Foodlink and others        At a press conference at Foodlink  s headquarters in Rochester  Senator Clinton and Foodlink spoke of how  by utilizing their regional food bank assets  Foodlink will act as a facilitator to help local farmers ship quality fresh produce from their farms to a central location in the City of Rochester  Growers can then sell their quality produce in local upstate markets or  with the help of distributors coordinated by Foodlink  take it to retailers  restaurants and more  in New York City and beyond          It is not good stewardship to put together millions of dollars worth of assets to just do charity     asserts Foodlink  s Executive Director Tom Ferraro    As the regional food bank for 30 years  we have been combating the symptoms of hunger  while an opportunity exists to use our existing infrastructure to impact the systemic causes of poverty by supporting Upstate economic development  job creation  and ensuring New York State dollars stay in our communities             Some of the biggest challenges to staying economically viable that farmers cite are the lack of local markets and the poor distribution system for their farm products   it is simply too hard or impossible for them to bring their goods to market     Senator Clinton said    I am so grateful that Foodlink recognizes those challenges and has stepped forward to help in this way             Expanding markets for fresh  locally grown New York State produce not only helps our farmers  but it also provides consumers with the high quality  specialty foods they demand and the nutritious produce that they deserve     Senator Clinton said    We hope that this announcement today will help make farmers throughout the region aware of this incredible resource that is now available to them  We also hope that the success of this Distribution Fulfillment Center will serve as a model that could be implemented in other parts of the State           An initial focus group held by Foodlink in March 2005 found that area school districts and food purchasers  despite their commitment to supporting local producers  experienced considerable difficulty in buying locally grown  New York State produce  Among the identified barriers was the lack of time that food purchasers have to personally connect with multiple farmers to locate the product they need and the desire for a central source point for quality  fresh  home grown produce  Conversely  smaller regional farmers were experiencing difficulties in getting their quality product to suppliers because of their own limitations  including lack of available staff  difficulties with transportation and the challenge of delivery schedules that conflict with the demands of the land        Through her   Farm to Fork    initiative  Senator Clinton has been an avid promoter of New York State  s agriculture and has been working hard with New York State growers  distributors  retailers  restaurateurs  and others to expand markets for New York  s diverse array of agricultural products  particularly in downstate regions such as New York City    As the regional food bank  Foodlink delivers donated food products to over 550 human service agencies in a 10 county area  After delivering food to area food pantries and shelters  Foodlink  s fleet of refrigerated trucks returns to its central warehousing facility empty while passing local farms struggling to find an economical way to bring their product to market          Recognizing the very real connection and distribution needs of New York  s smaller local farmers  Senator Clinton  s office connected with Foodlink several months ago to work on creating an alternate system that would not only help meet the needs of local producers and purchasers but would potentially open markets in New York City and beyond        The Foodlink Fulfillment Center partnership will provide the missing connection between small local farmers and food purchasers  serving as an ordering and central distribution point to link farmers and food producers with purchasers from restaurants  schools and other markets  By capitalizing on its existing infrastructure  which includes a fleet of trucks delivering to area non profits  a Fulfillment Center food warehousing infrastructure  a USDA certified repackaging facility and a computerized inventory system  Foodlink will pick up locally grown produce in its 10 county service area   Once the product is at the Foodlink warehouse  the product is either combined with other growers for a larger delivery to New York City  or is delivered directly to regional retailers for sale to local consumers        The Foodlink Fulfillment Center has already begun working with four area farmers including Finger Lakes Organic  Freshlink Farms  Pederson Farms and Red Jacket Orchards  The Fulfillment Center is seeking additional partners on both the supply side of product and the demand side for consumers who desire fresh New York State products         Foodlink is the foodbank of the Genesee Valley and Finger Lakes region  rescuing over 7 5 million pounds of food annually and redistributing it to over 550 human service agencies in a 10 county service area    In addition  Foodlink  s Community Kitchen prepares over 1500 meals daily for area youth in after school and summer meals programming  More information on Foodlink can be found at www foodlinkny org          Senator Clinton  s   Farm to Fork    initiative was designed to promote and conserve the amazing diversity of New York State  s agriculture and to connect farmers and producers with consumers  retailers and restaurateurs across the state and in New York City and beyond  Her   Farm to Fork    initiative is part of a long term effort on Senator Clinton  s part to establish the infrastructure that is vital to the effective marketing of upstate product to the downstate market and to promote upstate New York agriculture as a whole  As part of her campaign  Senator Clinton has held meetings to join growers and producers from across the state with key distributors and wholesalers  has taken restaurateurs and buyers on tours to experience the best of what New York  s growers and producers have to offer and has reinstituted   New York Farm Day    each year in Washington  DC         Images of the event may be downloaded at    http   www lrsiiimages com foodlink html
