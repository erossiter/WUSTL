December 5  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Final Report on the 9 11 Commission Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Today the ten members of the former 9 11 Commission issued its final report on our national homeland security preparedness   I commend each of them for their hard work and dedication to keeping our nation safe   I would also like to praise the persistence and hard work of the families of the victims of September 11th   It was the resolve of these brave families that led to the creation of the 9 11 Commission   We are indebted to all of these people in an immeasurable way            Unfortunately  the report card issued today by the former 9 11 Commission is an indictment of this Administration and the Congress  both of whom have demonstrated far too little urgency in enacting the reforms needed to properly secure our homeland and fight the War on Terror   All Americans should be outraged by this failure   As Chairman Kean and Vice Chair Hamilton said in their remarks accompanying their report  we should not need another wake up call   This denunciation confirms what I have maintained since we undertook the historic reorganization of our domestic security and intelligence community in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks    meaningful reform at all levels of government has been neglected           Last year  Congress passed and the President signed  the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004   While this important legislation made historic changes in the way our government collects and analyzes intelligence and fortifies our homeland  it fell short of implementing all of the 41 recommendations initially presented by the 9 11 Commission   This failure is highlighted among the shortcomings listed in the Committee  s report           For example  a critical failure raised in today  s report regards the allocation of homeland security funds based on risk   I have advocated for several years now that we need to use threat and risk based formulas for the allocation of critical homeland security funding to our local communities  states  and first responders   This is simple common sense   Our resources should be dedicated to addressing our most glaring weaknesses   I have introduced and sponsored legislation as well as encouraged my colleagues to account for this reality in our homeland security funding  most recently during consideration of the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill   All along I have maintained    as the former 9 11 Commission reiterated in its report today    that lawmakers should cease playing politics with the allocation of our scant resources by promoting distribution formulas that ignore risk and threat              The report highlights several other deficiencies  perhaps none more glaring than our failure to improve airline passenger pre screening   The former Commission gave an F grade to our efforts to shore up this vulnerability   In light of this  now is certainly not the time for the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  to lift its prohibition on certain dangerous items that have been banned from passenger planes since the 9 11 terrorist attacks   Last week I urged Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff to block the shortsighted proposal by the TSA to relax measures put in place after 9 11 to keep objects that could be used as weapons off our commercial aircraft   I also urged the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee and Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee to hold hearings to study the efficacy of such a plan  and announced plans to introduce legislation to preserve the current prohibited items list             The former 9 11 Commission has sent a clear  discernable message to the entire nation today    reform is needed at all levels of government   We must stop dragging our feet on the implementation of these critical reforms   This is true in regard to our intelligence community and the way we fund Homeland Security  but it is also true in regard to the essential oversight provided by the legislative branch
