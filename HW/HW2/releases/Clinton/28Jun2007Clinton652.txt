June 28  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Vote on Immigration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC  I am deeply disappointed that we still have not solved our nation s immigration crisis   We need comprehensive immigration reform  and I hope that we can find a solution that secures our borders  respects the rule of law  and honors both our history as a nation of immigrants and our basic values of respect and compassion  In particular  as part of this solution  we must protect the sanctity of families and repair the broken  unfair bureaucratic system that forces lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children   I am hopeful that one day soon we will be able to create a fairer process for people and families who are playing by the rules and seeking to come to this country in search of the American Dream  I will continue to work with my colleagues on a solution that honors all of these principles
