February 27  2007 Clinton Expresses Disappointment in VA Decision on Canandaigua Acute Psychiatric Unit  Cites Lack of Communication with Local Community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I was very disappointed to learn that the Department of Veterans Affairs has announced that by mid March they will complete the process of phasing out the 8 bed Acute Psychiatric Unit at the Canandaigua VA Medical Center   I believe that it is premature for the VA to remove these remaining acute inpatient psychiatric beds before a final decision has been made on all of the elements of the comprehensive Master Plan for the Canandaigua facility   Only by listening to our local veterans and understanding their needs can we effectively follow through on our national promise that those who serve will have access to first rate health care at VA facilities
