           Purchase  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with a panel of experts at Purchase College SUNY yesterday for the   Title IX Symposium 2006     designed to encourage students   interest in and excitement about math  science  technology and athletics  to  explore stereotypes about girls   and boys   interests and abilities in those areas  to promote fairness and equal opportunities in education and to inform students and adults about the scope and breadth of Title IX while discussing its local and national impact            For thirty years  Title IX has encouraged millions of women to participate in sports and in so many other fields   This law accomplished what so many Civil Rights laws do   it unlocked doors and created opportunities for women     Senator Clinton said    While we must do everything we can to protect and fully fund Title IX  we must also make sure that young people understand the opportunities that it provides and can take full advantage of its legacy  This conference is an important opportunity for all of us to learn about the benefits of Title IX and understand what we need to do to keep the promise of Title IX alive               This is a great opportunity for the Westchester community     said co host Deborah Slaner Larkin  Principal of the MARGARET Fund of the National Women  s Law Center     This is a chance to hear the insights of our inspirational panelists and presenters and be able to confront some of the high profile gender equity issues that have generated substantial public attention over the past year   This Symposium will enable students  their teachers  parents and advocates to understand their role in ensuring that all students have equal access both in the classroom and on the playing field  and to respond to those who mistakenly assert that education is a zero sum game in which the gains of one gender must come at the other  s expense             Girls and boys from 12 schools in the area  along with teachers and practitioners  attended the symposium to learn about Title IX and its impact on math  science  technology and athletics  While many people think Title IX is just about athletics  Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 requires gender equity for boys and girls in every aspect of educational programs that receive federal funding          At the Symposium  Senator Clinton spoke on the topic of Keeping Title IX Strong for Future Generations in a morning panel and provided closing remarks before breakout sessions   Other expert panelists

Research and Education Fund and the Westchester Medical Center Foundation           Senator Clinton has long fought to protect and fully fund Title IX  In the 108th Congress  Senator Clinton co sponsored both S  Res  40  which reaffirmed her commitment to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972  the federal law that requires schools to give girls and boys equal opportunities to participate in sports and S  Res  153  a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that changes to athletics policies issued under title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 would contradict the spirit of athletic equality and the intent to prohibit sex discrimination in education programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance  When the Bush Administration  s Commission on Opportunity in Athletics offered recommendations that  if implemented  would have undermined Title IX  Senator Clinton gave a strong speech on the floor of the U S  Senate   In that speech  she submitted into the Congressional Record the Commission  s minority report  written by the only elite women athletes on the Commission  which offered recommendations for strengthening Title IX   The Bush Administration s Commission had refused to include the views of these Commissioners in its official report          Senator Clinton also recently sent a letter  along with a number of her colleagues  to request that the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee hold a hearing on the Department of Education  s   Additional Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy
