Committees  which control the transit funding and tax portions of the bill   Both Senators fought hard to ensure that provisions important to New York were retained in the Conference Report            This is great news for Rochester  and the entire Finger Lakes region   These transportation funds keep New Yorkers moving quickly and safely  while creating jobs across the state  These federal dollars will be a huge shot in the arm for local transit needs    new buses  repairs for buses  and fixing up our stations    and highway repairs and upgrades   Without first rate highway and transit facilities  New York would literally stop short     Schumer said     The money for Renaissance Square will be the key to our continuing downtown redevelopment efforts  and will help with economic growth  transportation improvements  and arts and education in the greater Rochester area   This federal funding will present enormous opportunities for Rochester and the Finger Lakes                      After two years of hard work  we have achieved a bill that will create jobs and bring significant resources to Rochester and the Finger Lakes region  These funds will go a long way towards helping

efforts have resulted in New York s share of funds growing to meet the ever increasing transportation demands on our state   We have made a substantial contribution to the future of Rochester by investing in these critical road and transit projects   I am especially pleased that we were able to secure funding for the Renaissance Square Project  which holds great promise for economic development and growth downtown  I am also especially pleased to support RIT  s alternative fuels research  which may lead to reduced fuel costs and a cleaner environment  The dividends of these investments this will pay off for years  Finally  I am thrilled that we were able to secure language that will officially designate Interstate Highway 86 in the Southern Tier  as the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway   It is a most fitting tribute to his work  that this highway bear his name           The funding approved in the bill today includes          10 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for the Renaissance Square Project  which will be used to design and build the transit center which will include a new Monroe Community College downtown campus and a

environmental effects and the consumption of fossil fuels  extend the life cycle of public transportation vehicles  and optimize their performance  safety and uptime  through life cycle support and management  and promote vehicle remanufacturing and the use of remanufactured components to extend vehicle life  improve  performance and reduce capital purchase costs  while meeting environmental requirements        The Alternative Fuel   Life Cycle Engineering Program would have a significant national impact because it seeks to improve the performance  service life and safety of America  s public transportation vehicle fleet  According to RIT  in 2003 this fleet traveled 3 48 billion miles and cost  4 86 billion to maintain   Along with improvements to the public transportation infrastructure and the expansion of the vehicle fleet  optimizing the performance of existing vehicles is an important  cost effective  way to meet America  s increasing demand for public

of the surface transportation reauthorization bill   The provision was retained in this year  s bill and will now become law        Amo Houghton Bypass    Senators Clinton and Schumer secured approval to rename a portion of Route 86 near Corning  NY  after former Congressman Amo Houghton who was primarily responsible for securing the funding that made construction of this bypass possible  Senator

Research  MCEER   Clinton and Schumer secured approval for  1 25 million per year  over the next five years  in funding for research on the impact of seismic activity on the federal highway system and the nation  s transportation network as well as ways to reduce our vulnerability from earthquakes  In addition  the Senators provided an additional  3 million to support ongoing research activities   The funding will also help improve earthquake simulation facilities  This is an important economic generator in Western New York and will keep the University of Buffalo at the forefront of this important research  Senator Clinton promised to fight hard to include the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER  in this version of the bill  MCEER is a national center of excellence in advanced technology applications dedicated to the reduction of earthquake losses nationwide  MCEER is headquartered at the State University of New York at Buffalo  The Center was originally established by the National Science Foundation  NSF  in 1986 and has been included in every reauthorization bill since its creation   Senator Clinton sponsored an Amendment      High

Watertown to Vermont  and I 95 from New York to Connecticut to be designated as high priority corridors  making them eligible for specific high priority corridor funding         National System Study Commission   The Conference Report contains a provision creating the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that Senator Clinton authored as a member of the Environment

Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund into one single commission   Senator Clinton worked with former NYSDOT Commissioner and current Federal Railroad Administrator Joe Boardman to push this idea forward   The objective of combining these two bodies into a comprehensive evaluation of the future of transportation and its financing provides a roadmap for better allocation of transportation funding resources in the future   A better allocation will mean funding based on needs  which can only help New York   It will hopefully result in rewards for New York because of high transit use  which contributes to a more sustainable transportation network        CargoWatch Technology    the Senators secured  3 5 million for PAR Technology  s CargoWatch

each House  the approved Report will then go to the President  s desk to be signed   The bill originally passed the House on March 10 and the Senate on May 17   The new project funding is in addition to any money already approved by the House
