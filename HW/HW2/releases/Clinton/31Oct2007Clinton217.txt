October 31  2007 Senator Clinton Addresses the Licensing Process for the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC  At a Senate Environment and Public Works Hearing today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton addressed the licensing process and the status of the Environmental Protection Agencys  EPAs  radiation standard for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository     A transcript of Senator Clintons remarks is below     Senator Clinton  I want to begin by thanking Chairman Boxer for holding this hearing   I think it is particularly timely because we are nearing a critical stage of the process  which is the June 2008 date when the Department of Energy plans to submit a license application for Yucca Mountain to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission      So I think its important that we use this hearing to get the Administration on record in response to some important  unanswered questions about how this process will work    I want to start by stating what the available scientific evidence makes clear   Yucca Mountain is not a safe place to store spent fuel from our nations nuclear reactors            First off  Yucca Mountain is located in an area of considerable seismic activity   There are 32 known active faults at or near Yucca Mountain  there have been more than 600 seismic events registering above 2 5 on the Richter scale within a 50 mile radius of Yucca Mountain in the last 30 years   In 1992  an earthquake registering 5 6 on the Richter scale occurred just eight miles away   And just last month  it was reported that the Department of Energy had to alter plans at the site after rock samples unexpectedly revealed a fault line underneath the proposed location of the concrete pads where waste would cool before going into the repository     Looking forward  scientists have predicted that an earthquake registering 6 or more on the Richter scale is likely to occur in the next 10 000 years  given that Nevada is the third most earthquake prone state in the country after California and Alaska      An even greater potential risk at the site is its history of volcanic activity   As an MIT geologist testified to this committee last year  and I quote      Though the likelihood of an explosive volcano erupting directly beneath the repository is remote  the outcome would be devastating  spewing radioactive material directly into the atmosphere  End quote    In addition  the rock at the site has proven to be more porous than the Department of Energy once thought  raising major concerns about contamination of scarce groundwater less than 100 miles from Las Vegas   In recent years  scientists discovered that radiation from nuclear tests done in the 1950s had migrated downward with rain water to more than six hundred feet below groundrates far faster than predicted by Department of Energy   This poses the threat of corrosion of the containers in which the waste would be stored  as well as the potential for much more rapid spread of contamination in groundwater     Because of these many flaws in the geology of the site  the DOE has turned to what it calls engineered controls to try to contain the waste   In other words  the containers that the waste would be stored in are to be trusted to resist rusting for hundreds of thousands of years under intense heat and the presence of humidity      Given these problems  it is not surprising that the Administration has been so opaque about the licensing process  As the testimony of Nevadas Attorney General makes clear  the licensing process puts the cart before the horse   EPA has yet to finalize the radiation standards that  DOE  must prove it will be able meet in order to license the repository  and the NRC has stated they will accept the application even if EPA standards are not in place when it is filed      Madame Chairman  does this make sense at all   Is this site and this process really the best we can do    I know that some believe that Yucca Mountain is a referendum on the future of nuclear power  or that the waste accumulating across the country is imperative enough to override the clear problems with the site   I strongly disagree   Thats why I voted against the resolution overriding Nevadas veto of Yucca Mountain in July of 2002  and thats why I remain opposed today      We do need to find a long term storage solution for our nations nuclear waste   But Yucca Mountain is not the answer   Its time to step back and take a deep breath   The twenty five years since the Nuclear Waste Policy Act passed seems like a long time ago  But this is a decision that future generations will live with for hundreds of thousands of yearslonger than any of us can imagine      So we need to get it right   Its time move on from Yucca Mountain   I believe we should start over  and assemble our best scientific minds to identify alternatives   In the meantime  we need to make sure we are storing waste safely and securely at the reactor sites where its located today   And we need to do better thinking about the massive challenge of transporting waste safely and securely from reactor sites to a permanent repository      What we should not do is to push an incomplete application for a flawed site through a rushed and incoherent process   But unfortunately  it is clear from the testimony submitted by our witnesses representing the Administration that that is precisely the course of action that this Administration intends to pursue   I think we can do better  and I hope that we will get the chance to do that    And  Madame Chairman  again thank you for holding this critical hearing    Senator Clinton  Thank you very much Senator Carper  Thank you gentlemen for being here  I must to say that your respective testimony raises a lot of confusing questions  If the EPA standards and NRC licensing regulations are not yet final  it is sort of hard on the matter of logic to understand whether the NRC can properly docket and begin a substantive review of DOEs license application  As you all noted in your testimony  EPAs radiation standard is still not final  yet the DOE continues to prepare an application to meet this unknown standard  And the NRC indicates that they will begin to process the license even if EPA has not finalized the radiation standard when it is received  I do not believe that this comports with the process that the Congress set out and it certainly seems to be putting the cart before the horse     In a few minutes we will hear from Nevadas Attorney General and her testimony makes clear that this kind of unclear process puts Nevada at a great disadvantage  And the Nevada Attorney General contends that the NRC should be prohibited from accepting DOEs license applications for review until final EPA and NRC regulatory requirements are in place  That seems obvious to me     So  I have several questions about the process and about your testimony and I want to lay them all out and go through them quickly  First  if I could  let me turn to Mr  Myers  When will EPA finalize the radiation standard   Mr  Myers  Excuse me  Senator  In my written testimony I indicated that it was our hope to get that done soon    Senator Clinton  And  what does soon mean   Mr  Meyers  Soon means  probably the normal meaning of the term  It is our intent to continue to work on this and get this done soon   Senator Clinton  That is very enlightening Mr  Myers  I must confess  Now  when you get it soon  will soon be before the NRC has to act   Mr  Myers  We are focused on our process Senator Clinton  and completing our process    Senator Clinton  Well  thats the problem  Your final EPA standard is certainly key to any NRC action because if the standard is not finished soon  by the time the NRC acts  then the NRC will be acting without the standard  Do you agree with that    Mr  Myers  That could be hypothetically correct  but we intend to proceed with our standard and finish it   Senator Clinton  Secondly  let me ask you  Mr  Sproat  why is the Department Of Energy rushing to finalize the license application by June of next year in the absence of a final EPA standard   Mr  Sproat  Good question Senator  I just want to make clear  in terms of the NRC regulations that govern the licensing and the design requirements for Yucca Mountain  those regulations have been in place for almost a decade  There are literally hundreds of pages of those regulations  and our license application needs to address all of those  One very small piece  is the last piece that says  what is the long term radioactive release exposure rates that are potentially to emanate from Yucca Mountain out to a million years  Thats the one last piece of literally hundreds of pages of regulation that isnt done yet     For us  in preparing our license application  we need to do the calculations to determine how the repository will actually work  and we are doing that  As a matter of fact  we published our preliminary results in our supplemental environmental impact statement that we released three weeks ago  And it shows that the peak dose from Yucca Mountain  the projected peak dose  will be in about 200 thousand years from now  and will be less than 5 millirems  which is  equivalent to  the combined exposure of a roundtrip air trip between New York and Los Angeles     Senator Clinton  But you know Mr  Sproat  what is suggested to me by the delay of the EPAs final standard is that perhaps the EPA doesnt agree with that  Clearly this has been put on a fast track for this administration  and if the EPA had a sense of urgency about it  and if Mr  Myers was not put in the awkward situation of having to play semantic games in trying to respond to my question  there would already be a radiation standard  So what Im picking up is that there is a disagreement here  and that DOE is going full fledged ahead and EPA is dragging its feet because EPA doesnt want to be on the record of either contradicting DOE or having to once again mangle science in order to get to some preconceived outcome that will suit those who wish to move forward on this     But finally  let me ask Mr  Webber  why wont the NRC refuse to accept the application until after the EPA radiation standard and your own standards are complete  Because not only dont we have the EPA radiation standard  but we also dont have your standards either    Mr  Webber  Clearly  Senator  our preference would be to have the EPA final standard and NRCs requirements in place before the receipt of the application  Congress addressed this in addressing the legislation and we cannot make our licensing finding on the construction authorization until such time as we have in fact received the EPA standard and conformed our regulations  because the finding that the Congress charged the NRC to make is that among all the requirements that Mr  Sproat referred to  one of them is that the EPA standard has been satisfied    Senator Clinton  Well does that mean then that you will delay accepting the application or you will delay acting on the application   Mr  Webber  If we receive the application  we will commence our review  We cannot complete that review and reach our regulatory decision until such time as we have the requirements in place    Senator Clinton  Thank you very much and Senator Carper I will be submitting additional questions for the record    EARLIER  Senator
