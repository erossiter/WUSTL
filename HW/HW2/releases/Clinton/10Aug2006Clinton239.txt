                                                                                                                                                                                                                        In preparation for a possible announcement tomorrow on the future of the New York VA Hospitals  Senator calls again on VA Secretary Nicholson to keep the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA facilities open                                                                                                                                                                                                              New York  NY    On the eve of a possible announcement by U S  Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson in New York tomorrow  Senator Clinton reiterated her call for the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA Hospitals to remain open  In a letter to Secretary Nicholson  Senator Clinton said she had been informed that he may be making an announcement about the hospitals   future on Friday in New York City and urged the Secretary to use it as an opportunity to affirm his commitment to both facilities            The Secretary  s announcement would seem like the perfect opportunity to affirm his commitment to keeping both the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA Hospitals open  I urge the Secretary to tell local veterans in New York that their hospitals will remain open and that they can continue to get the healthcare services they need and deserve     Senator Clinton said           A copy of Senator  s letter to Secretary Nicholson is below          August 10  2006      The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary  United States Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20420      Dear Mr  Secretary       My office has been informed that you will be visiting the Manhattan Veterans Administration  VA  hospital on Friday   I urge you to use this visit as an opportunity to affirm that both the Manhattan VA and the Brooklyn VA hospitals should remain open          As you know  I have previously raised serious concerns regarding the VA  s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study further changes in New York  s VA facilities  including the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals   In April 2005  shortly after your confirmation as VA Secretary  I met with you and handed you a letter outlining these concerns            At various hearings of the Local Advisory Panel of the VA Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Project  I have submitted testimony opposing the closure of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals   As I have noted  any decision regarding the future of the Manhattan VA hospital must take into account the unique relationship between the New York University School of Medicine and the Manhattan VA hospital   The partnership between the institutions has made the Manhattan VA hospital a model of high quality care  with six tertiary care specialties designated by the VA as centers of excellence   As you know  this hospital is also the home for the VISN 3 Interventional Cardiology  Cardiac Surgery and Neurosurgery Referral Centers   Closure of the Manhattan VA would not only imperil the relationship with NYU  but would also leave the approximately 185 000 veterans serviced in VISN 3 without ready access to those specialized programs          Likewise  the Brooklyn VA has multiple bed services and provides specialized cancer care   The Brooklyn VA maintains an affiliation with the SUNY Downstate Medical School   Just as the relationship between the Manhattan VA and the New York University School of Medicine would be imperiled by closure of the Manhattan VA  closure of the Brooklyn VA would threaten the existing SUNY relationship with the VA to the detriment of New York  s veterans           You should also take into account the practical matter of transportation when you consider the future of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals   The high quality services at the Manhattan VA hospital attract veterans from the City of New York as well as surrounding areas and other states   One of the main reasons that the Manhattan VA is able to serve these veterans is its remarkable accessibility  located in the heart of Manhattan at the center of a mass transit system that is unmatched anywhere in the world   Similarly  a number of SUNY Downstate department chairs have pointed out that the Brooklyn VA is accessible to motor vehicles by virtue of its proximity in Brooklyn to the Belt Parkway and the Verrazano Bridge           At this time in our nation  s history  with United States troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation   Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and not implement changes that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care          Given the strong arguments for keeping both the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals open  I hope you will use Friday  s visit to the Manhattan VA to affirm your commitment to keeping both facilities open          Please do not hesitate to contact me or my staff if you have any questions  Thank you for your consideration          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
