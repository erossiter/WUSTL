                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Senator Continues to Voice Her Opposition to Seaway Expansion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Following her questions Tuesday to Charles Dorkey  nominee for the Advisory Board of the St Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has secured support from Mr  Dorkey for public hearings on the Great Lakes Navigation Study after its completion  which is expected next year           The commitment came as Mr  Dorkey answered questions that Senator Clinton had submitted as he was appearing before a nominations hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee  Senator Clinton had submitted her questions to Mr  Dorkey through the Committee to elicit his views on Seaway expansion and a range of issues relating to the management of the Seaway  In his answers  Mr  Dorkey also agreed with Senator Clinton about the importance of community consultation on the Seaway  s future and that the issue of invasive species needs to be addressed immediately            I am pleased that Mr  Dorkey has indicated his support for public hearings on the Great Lakes Navigation Study     Senator Clinton said    I continue to believe that expansion of the Seaway does not make environmental or economic sense and Mr  Dorkey seems open to working with Members of Congress and the community on this and other vital issues             Senator Clinton has long fought efforts to expand the Seaway   She pushed the Corps of Engineers to limit the scope of the current Seaway study  known as the Great Lakes Navigation Study  GLNS   to maintaining the current Seaway configuration   In addition  she has passed through the Senate a provision that would force the Corps to conduct public meetings in New York and throughout the Great Lakes region about the GLNS before beginning any additional study          Senator Clinton  s questions with Mr  Dorkey  s answers are below         Questions for the Record  Charles E  Dorkey III  Nominee for Member of the Advisory Board    St  Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation      1  The U S  Army Corps of Engineers has been examining the feasibility of spending billions of dollars to physically expand the Seaway in its Great Lakes Navigation Study   I strongly believe that such a plan would waste taxpayer dollars and pose an unacceptable threat to the health of the St  Lawrence River   I have been pushing the Corps to complete the current phase of the study and to hold public meetings in New York and throughout the Great Lakes before any additional study is initiated  Do you support public hearings on the Great Lakes Navigation Study and what are your views about Seaway expansion         Answer   As a matter of good government  I believe that it is important to solicit the views of all stakeholders in making decisions   Accordingly  if confirmed  I would support public hearings on the Great Lakes Navigation Study   On the merits of the issue  I will promise to study carefully the issues of Seaway expansion and seek to understand the balance between any possible benefit to the public  and the cost and potential burden to the public       2  The SLSDC has traditionally worked primarily with the shipping industry  yet its regulations and programs have a direct impact on the communities along the St  Lawrence River  I believe that SLSDC should better involve local communities in SLSDC decision making   Will you pledge to work to increase the transparency of the Seaway s decision making and programs        Answer   As I stated in my testimony    I have worked as a public member of government entities and corporations  and know how important it is that there be communication with all stakeholders  that decisions affecting people and interests be principled  explained  and transparent  and that the public interest always comes first      If confirmed as a board member of the SLSDC  I pledge to apply these basic principles       3  Ballast water discharge from ships transiting the Seaway is the principle vector for invasive species introductions into the Great Lakes  Would you support swift development and implementation of tough ballast water regulations to reduce this threat to the ecology of the Great Lakes       Answer   Introduction of invasive species through ballast water is a serious problem that needs to be resolved   I believe the SLSDC should take a pro active role in solving this problem  and  if confirmed  I pledge to work with Congress  the Administration and the shipping industry to address this critical issue       4  It looks as though the proposal to privatize the Seaway by creating a  bi national authority  to manage the Seaway is again being discussed  Do you support privatizing the Seaway system        Answer   At this point  I do not have enough information to either support or oppose privatization of the Seaway system   The privatization of a transportation system is a significant undertaking that would require careful study and analysis after input from all relevant stakeholders  If confirmed  I pledge to work with all stakeholders to determine the effects of privatization proposals
