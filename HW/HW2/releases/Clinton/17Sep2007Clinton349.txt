September 17  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to Be Attorney General of the Unied States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I look forward to learning more about Judge Mukasey s views during his confirmation hearings   Our next Attorney General must respect the Constitution and the rule of law  and it is my hope that during his confirmation hearings Judge Mukasey demonstrates that he will continue his years of able public service to restore these principles to the Department of Justice
