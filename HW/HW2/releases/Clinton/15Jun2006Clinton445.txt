June 15  2006 Senator Clinton Calls Secretary Rice to Urge Sending Measure to Congress that Will Enable Israel s Magen David Adom to Join the International Red Cross                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to urge her and the Bush Administration to submit the Third Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions to the Senate  The Third Additional Protocol was approved by member states in December 2005 and provides a means by which Israel  s Magen David Adom can join the International Red Cross   Members of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement will gather next week to approve changes necessary to allow Magen David Adom to join the movement             Inclusion of Israel  s Magen David Adom in the International Red Cross has long been on of my top priorities   I urged Secretary Rice to take prompt action to have the United States approve the changes in international agreements that will allow Magen David Adom to join the International Red Cross   It is time to rectify the injustice of Magen David Adom  s exclusion from the International Red Cross     Senator Clinton said           Senator Clinton has been a tireless advocate of Magen David Adom  s inclusion in the International Red Cross since she began her Senate term   Last November  Senator Clinton visited MDA  s headquarters in Jerusalem and was briefed about the important humanitarian work that they perform  both in Israel and the world   She and Senator Elizabeth Dole  R NC  have also written to Secretary Rice  joined by a bipartisan coalition of Senators  requesting her assistance in facilitating the submission of the Third Additional Protocol to the Senate             If the Third Additional Protocol is ratified by the United States prior to the International Conference on June 19   21  we believe it will send a clear message of support for Israel to the other Governments   It will also signal to the world that the United States Government has taken a leadership position in the support of a new symbol that will afford needed protection to humanitarians working in conflict zones who otherwise may be targeted if they use the Red Cross or Red Crescent     the Senators wrote
