                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Bill Includes Seven Amendments Authored by Senator Clinton                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  the first New York Senator to serve as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  announced that the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Authorization bill approved by the Senate includes seven major amendments she authored  a significant achievement with a major impact on the legislation              With our service members serving bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere  I am pleased to support this defense authorization bill   I  m also pleased that the Senate agreed to accept several of my amendments which will provide greater support for our men and women in uniform     Senator Clinton said    We must do everything we can to help our newest generation of war heroes and their families   those who have proudly served our nation and have made extraordinary sacrifices  We owe it to our men and women in uniform to give them the resources and support they need             Senator Clinton  s amendments include        Heroes at Home   Senator Clinton  s amendment is aimed at enhancing support and services for U S  troops transitioning back home after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan  Senator Clinton  s amendment proposes several key initiatives to assist military service members of Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  with readjustment to work  posttraumatic stress disorder  PTSD  and other mental health issues  and traumatic brain injury  TBI   The measure  which is supported by the National Military Family Association and the Wounded Warrior Project  also provides support to the family members of our returning troops   Specifically  the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a special working group  partnering representatives from the public and private sectors to identify the needs of returning National Guard and Reserve members in their transition to civilian jobs after deployment  including members who have been injured while serving  and to develop recommendations on ways to improve assistance to them  Under the amendment  the existing Department of Defense  DOD  Task Force on Mental Health is charged with assessing mental health conditions  including PTSD  occurring in National Guard and Reserve members undergoing multiple deployments and with making recommendations for improving mental health services for them  The amendment further delegates an office in DOD specifically for employers  employment assistance organizations  and associations of employers to provide them with best practices  education  and other resources for ensuring the success of Guard and Reserve members in resuming civilian work   Demonstration grants would be awarded to organizations in community settings  such as community mental health clinics and community colleges  for providing PTSD and other mental health education and assistance to National Guard and Reserve members and their families  since many of these troops return to local communities scattered across the country far away from military bases and VA hospitals   The amendment also calls for a study on the long term physical and mental health consequences and rehabilitation needs of traumatic brain injured service members  as well as on the types of long term care services available to them  To further assist the mushrooming number of traumatic brain injured service members and their families  the amendment would establish a TBI Family Caregiver Training Curricula for health professionals at DOD and VA hospitals  who would use the curricula to teach family members important skills for caring for their loved ones suffering from TBI when they go home       Improving Retirement and TRICARE Benefits for Guard and Reserve    Senator Clinton  s amendment  coauthored with Senate Armed Services Committee colleagues Senator Saxby Chambliss  R GA  and Lindsey Graham  R SC   will improve retirement and TRICARE benefits for National Guard members and Reservists   For every consecutive 90 days a member spends in an active federal status  the age at which they receive their retirement annuity would be decreased by three months   The lowest a member could collect retirement pay as a result of this provision would be age 50   Any Guard or Reserve member who is called or ordered to active duty or volunteers for active duty would qualify   In addition  the amendment further expands access to TRICARE   Last year  Senators Clinton and Graham secured passage of an amendment to the DoD bill that made all members of the Selected Reserve eligible to enroll in TRICARE  and created a separate category based on whether a Guard member or Reservist had been deployed  Category 1 for members of the Selected Reserves who had been activated  members would accumulate one year of TRICARE coverage for every 90 days of active duty service and would only have to pay 28 percent of the cost  Category 2 established a 50 50 cost share for those without health insurance due to unemployment or lack of employer provided coverage  And Category 3 covered the remainder of members of the Selected Reserve who did not fit in the other categories  allowing them to buy into coverage at an 85 percent cost share   This year  s amendment will allow an employee of a small business with 20 employees or under to qualify for a 50 50 cost share  and it reduces the cost share of those who qualify for Category 3 to 75 percent          Darfur   Senator Clinton  s amendment requires the President to publish regular reports on the situation in Darfur  This amendment builds on the signing of the Darfur Peace Agreement  DPA  on May 5 by the Government of Sudan and one faction of the SLM A  and helps to encourage sustained U S  attention to the behavior of these and other parties in the field   Under Senator Clinton  s amendment  the President would report specifically on the efforts being made by the DPA signatories to uphold their commitments to demobilize the Janjaweed  provide secure and unfettered access for humanitarian operations  ensure foreign fighters   respect for peace in Darfur  and provide for the safe and voluntary return of displaced Darfuris to their homes  The amendment also would require the President to report any violations of the peace and any obstructions of monitoring efforts  This reporting would continue until the President certifies that the Government of Sudan has fulfilled its obligations to demobilize the Janjaweed and protect civilians       Energy Efficiency   Senator Clinton also passed an amendment to reduce fuel usage by the Department of Defense  which is the country  s largest single consumer of petroleum   The amendment would establish it as the policy of the Department of Defense to improve the fuel efficiency of weapons platforms  consistent with mission requirements  in order to enhance platform performance  reduce the size of the fuel logistics system  reduce the burden high fuel consumption places on agility  reduce operating costs  and dampen the financial impact of volatile oil prices   The amendment builds on a 2001 report of the Defense Science Board  which made a series of recommendations to better integrate the warfighting  logistics and cost benefits of more efficient weapons systems into the Department  s acquisition and research systems processes   The amendment requires a report to Congress within one year on progress towards implementing the new energy efficiency policy  the recommendations of the 2001 report  and the recommendations of a May  2006 Defense Science Board Task Force on energy efficiency         Naval Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps  NJROTC  programs in Mattituck and Greenport   Senator Clinton  s amendment requires the Department of Defense to review its decision that led to the proposed elimination of Naval Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps  NJROTC  programs in Mattituck and Greenport   Specifically  the amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to review the 1976 legal opinion issued by the Department of Defense General Counsel that determined that Junior Reserve Officers  Training Corps  JROTC  instructors may be transported to a non host school only to teach students previously enrolled in the JROTC unit at the host school  and only when it is impractical to require them to take courses at that host school  The purpose of the secretary s review would be to determine whether changes in the law since 1976  including the repeal of the statutory limits on the number of JROTC units  and local school redistricting  which have split a host school s JROTC students into nearly equal groups  would now allow for the instructors from a host school to travel to and instruct JROTC students at another nearby school  This section also would allow a host school that is currently providing for the assignment of JROTC instructors to another school with 70 or more students the authority to continue such support until 180 days following the submission of the report by the Secretary of Defense          Military Readiness   Senator Clinton  s amendment requires the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the readiness of the Ground Forces within the Army and Marine Corps   The Senator  s amendment is aimed at providing additional transparency as to the true readiness of the military  so as to better identify where Congress can help focus its efforts   The Senator s amendment would require the GAO to  1  assess trained and ready forces for ongoing operations as well as future requirements   2  assess the availability and readiness of equipment for training and ongoing operations   3  review current personnel tempo with a particular focus on deployment and retention rates for both unusually high and low demand skills   4  evaluate service efforts to mitigate high personnel operational tempos  and  5  describe current reserve component mobilization policy with an analysis of projected future availability   Senator Clinton  s amendment is part of a continuing effort to study the current state of our ground forces and better highlight where Congress should focus its efforts to ensure the continued preparedness of our Army and Marine Corps       Wounded Soldiers   Pay Issues   Senator Clinton  s amendment addresses continuing reports of soldiers who have been withdrawn from combat on the basis of medical issues and have experienced payroll problems or have been wrongly charged for certain services or equipment   In a continuing effort to ensure that those who have given so much are not further burdened with resolving pay account issues  Senator Clinton  s wounded soldier pay audit amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a toll free call assistance center focused on providing wounded members of the Armed Forces  or their primary next of kin  with help relating to military pay issues  The Senator  s amendment also requires the Department of the Army to conduct an audit of its wounded soldiers   pay accounts and report back to Congress in 120 days   As recently as April 26  2006  a Government Accountability Office report found that nearly 1 300 battle injured soldiers and soldiers killed in combat in the first four years of the Global War on Terror had incurred a total of  1 5 million in debt  Press reports have also revealed that the Army has granted more than 600 requests by soldiers for debt forgiveness   totaling more than  600 000   on the basis that the debt was wrongly charged
