June 27  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Continued Detention of Iranian Americans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I am saddened and dismayed by the continued detention of Dr  Haleh Esfandiari and Parnaz Azima  and the recent arrests of fellow Iranian Americans Dr  Kian Tajbakhsh and Ali Shakeri   I have joined the fifteen women Senators in writing to Secretary General Ban Ki Moon urging him to intervene on behalf of Dr  Esfandiari and Ms  Azima  and I am gravely disappointed that the situation in Iran has been allowed to escalate   It is an unconscionable violation of human rights to detain and imprison individuals without just cause  and we cannot let this situation stand    All of these individuals have taken steps to promote peace and understanding between Iran and the United States   Dr  Esfandiari is head of the Middle East Progam at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars  where she has worked to raise  awareness of international women s issues   Ms  Azima is a journalist for Radio Farda  the Persian language service of Voice of America Radio Free Europe  where she has presented unbiased information on current events   Dr  Tajbakhsh is an urban planning expert who has consulted on behalf of the World Bank on development projects  and   Mr  Shakeri is a founder and board member of the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding at the University of California Irvine   Allegations that their activities   activities that are in the public s interest  and a public service   are attempts to overthrow the Iranian government are unfounded and baseless  and must not go unchallenged by the international community    It is imperative that these Iranian Americans be able to return unharmed to their families and homes  where they can continue to carry out their work of promoting international understanding   I call upon the United Nations to work with international partners and its member states to secure their release  and I pledge to do all I can with my partners in Congress to ensure that no harm comes to these individuals
