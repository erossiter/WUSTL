March 14  2007 Senator Clinton Announces Legislation to Expand Mercury Pollution Monitoring                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Legislation Replaces Flawed EPA Modeling Results with Sound Scientific Measurements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she has joined with Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act  The legislation would create a comprehensive new program to measure mercury levels from air pollution across the United States rather than relying on the inaccurate computer models that were used by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to justify the flawed Clean Air Mercury Rule issued in 2005           The groundbreaking mercury study released earlier this year by researchers from Syracuse and Clarkson Universities and the Hubbard Brook Foundation clearly shows that there are mercury  hotspots   where levels of this dangerous neurotoxin are dramatically higher   Some of the highest levels of mercury were found in the Adirondack Mountains in Upstate New York   The confirmation of these hotspots means that we cannot allow  trading  of mercury pollution from power plants  as the Administration has proposed in its  Clean Air Mercury Rule    We also need to do a much better job at measuring how mercury from air pollution accumulates in the environment  and that s what this legislation would do   said Senator Clinton           This legislation would authorize funding through 2013 for the EPA  United States Geological Survey  United States Fish and Wildlife Service  and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to create a nationwide mercury monitoring program   It would also establish mercury monitoring sites across the nation in order to accurately measure mercury levels in the air  rain  soil  lakes and streams  and in plants and animals          The legislation is designed to address mercury hotspots from air pollution found in new studies by David Evers and Wing Goodale of the Biodiversity Research Institute in Gorham  Maine  Charles Driscoll of Syracuse University  Kathleen Fallon Lambert of the Hubbard Brook Research Foundation  HBRF  in Hanover  New Hampshire and others  which were published in the January issue of BioScience Magazine  The studies demonstrate the existence of mercury hotspots in the northeastern United States  including the Adirondack Mountains  and attribute much of the cause of the hotspots to power plant emissions  According to the HBRF study  the Adirondack Mountains are especially sensitive to mercury emissions because of decades of acid rain and emission sources such as coal fired power plants           The studies conflict markedly with EPA s computer modeling data which was used to justify the EPA Clean Air Mercury Rule  The studies demonstrate major flaws in the EPA Mercury Rule and also demonstrate the need for real mercury measurements  instead of the computer model used by EPA          Senator Clinton joined with Senators Susan M  Collins  R ME  and Joseph I  Lieberman  ID CT  in introducing this legislation
