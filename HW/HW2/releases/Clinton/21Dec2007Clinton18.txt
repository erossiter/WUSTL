December 21  2007 Clinton  Andrews Introduce Legislation to Improve Enforcement of the Davis Bacon Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congressman Rob Andrews  D NJ  announced today that they have introduced legislation to improve the enforcement of the Davis Bacon Act   The legislation would allow workers to monitor compliance with the Act by giving them access under the Freedom of Information Act to the payroll records that contractors file with the federal government   The legislation would also make more consistent the treatment of similar offenses under the law by increasing penalties under the Davis Bacon Related Acts to the same level as under the Davis Bacon Act    We should all be committed to the vigorous enforcement of the wage and hour laws  said Senator Clinton   This legislation will improve the enforcement of the Davis Bacon Act by requiring the disclosure of information needed to monitor compliance with the Act  and imposing equitable penalties on companies that violate the Act   Working families deserve and depend on the fair and full enforcement of the labor laws  and this legislation would go a long way towards achieving that goal    Clear and consistent penalties are critical to the proper enforcement of Davis Bacon wage laws  said Representative Andrews   In order to maintain oversight and full disclosure  it is essential to provide access to the necessary information to make sure companies are paying fair wages     Senator Clinton and Congressman Andrews are to be applauded for introducing this much needed legislation to improve the enforcement of the federal Davis Bacon Act  said Mark H  Ayers  President of the Building  Construction Trades Department  AFL CIO   For too long  unscrupulous contractors have managed to evade the payment of prevailing wages on federally financed construction projects due  in large part  to lax enforcement   By providing workers with the ability to access payroll records through the Freedom of Information Act  and by increasing the penalties associated with Davis Bacon violations  Senator Clintons bill will help put an end to worker exploitation and wage rip offs in the U S  construction industry    The Davis Bacon Act requires contractors for federal projects to pay their workers no less than the wage rates prevailing in the local area   The Bush administration has slashed the number of employees working on enforcing wage and hour laws like the Davis Bacon Act   One recent report by the Brennan Center for Justice found pervasive violations of the wage and hour laws in New York City   Unscrupulous employers understand that there is a minimal risk of being caught for these violations  the report explained  and even if they are caught  that they will likely pay no more than a portion of the wages they owe      The legislation introduced by Senator Clinton and Congressman Andrews  the Davis Bacon Enforcement Act  would improve the enforcement of the Davis Bacon Act in two ways   First  the bill would require the disclosure of all information contained in contractor payroll records except workers social security numbers   Under current law  the public is allowed access to the contractor payroll records  but information that is needed to adequately monitor both contractor compliance and agency enforcement efforts is routinely deleted  often making the remaining information useless in efforts to determine whether contractors are complying with the Davis Bacon Act   The courts once held that this information could be disclosed to members of the public in order to monitor enforcement of the Act  but a Supreme Court decision narrowed the scope of FOIA in a way that led lower courts to deny disclosure of this information   This legislation would make clear that this information can once again be disclosed under FOIA    Second  the bill would fix a discrepancy in the law that permits a contractor who is found to have violate the Davis Bacon Act to be debarred from being awarded federal contracts for three years  but a contractor who is found to have violated one of the Davis Bacon Related Acts  which are a number of later acts incorporating the Davis Bacon wage provisions  to be debarred for as little as six  6  months   This disparity in punishment for similar violations depending entirely on which federal project offending contractors happen to be working on makes no sense   This legislation would remedy this inconsistency and ensure that all violations of the Davis Bacon are treated in an even handed manner    Senator Clinton is a member of the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions and has been a leader in fighting for labor protections in the Senate   She has introduced and fought for a wide range of measures on issues relating to wage  hour and benefit protections   Earlier this week  Senator Clinton reintroduced legislation that she first introduced in 2006 to tie increases in the minimum wage to congressional pay increases   Earlier this month  a bill that she introduced with Senator Chris Dodd  D CT  and a bipartisan coalition of Senators to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act for the family members of wounded soldiers passed the Congress as a part of the 2008 Department of Defense Authorization bill  and is awaiting the Presidents signature      Congressman Andrews is Chairman of the Education and Labor Subcommittee on Health  Employment  Labor and Pensions  HELP    Under the Subcommittees jurisdiction  Rep  Andrews has responsibility for the health insurance  pension and labor laws of the nation   Congressman Andrews has been instrumental in passing legislation such as the Employee Free Choice Act to ensure employee have the choice to unionize  the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act to protect workers from having the premiums of their health plans adjusted based on genetic information  the Mental Health Parity Act  which expands health care coverage of mental health and substance related disorders   and the Re Empowerment of Skilled and Professional Employees and Construction Tradesworkers  RESPECT  Act  which restores the supervisor definition to what Congress originally intended for the National Labor Relations Acts NLRAs coverage of employees and exclusion of true supervisors
