December 2  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on Secretary Chertoff to Reject Proposal to Relax Ban on Dangerous Objects Aboard Aircraft  Calls For Congressional Hearings on Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is urging Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff to block a proposal announced today by the Transportation Security Administration to relax measures put in place after 9 11 to keep objects that could be used as weapons off commercial aircraft   Underscoring that Congress has not been fully briefed on the proposal  Senator Clinton also is calling for Congressional hearings to address potential security problems associated with this announcement           New Yorkers know all too well the serious consequences when terrorists exploit aviation security weaknesses   Allowing dangerous objects on our commercial aircraft would hinder the progress this nation has made to improve aviation safety     said Senator Clinton     I urge Secretary Chertoff to reject this proposal until all possible security threats are addressed  and I call upon the Republican leadership to hold hearings before any action is taken that could jeopardize our safety and security           Below are the text of letters sent by Senator Clinton to Secretary Chertoff and to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee and Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee        December 1  2005       The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C   20528       Dear Mr  Secretary        Reports indicate that the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  is poised to announce changes to the list of items that are prohibited aboard aircraft which would result in potentially dangerous objects being reintroduced onto commercial airplanes such as tools or scissors as long as six or four inches respectively   I understand that TSA Administrator Hawley is planning to make this announcement sometime tomorrow morning but Congress has not been fully briefed on this announcement and I believe such changes could decrease passenger and cabin crew safety   Further  allowing these previously prohibited items onto aircraft will not necessarily decrease wait times for passengers   In fact  it could increase wait times if passengers are unclear about what items are permissible or impermissible   Such confusion could result in further delays if more items are attempted to be carried onboard          The heinous attacks on September 11th warranted a restructuring of our transportation safety capabilities especially in the area of commercial aviation   While I applaud TSA  s efforts to increase awareness of explosives detection  decrease passenger waiting time  and implement changes that will make security patterns less predictable  it is unclear how allowing such previously prohibited  dangerous items onboard aircraft will assist the TSA in making the flying public more secure          TSA must adjust and adapt to continuing threats posed to commercial aviation   The changes proposed by the TSA to allow scissors of four inches or less or tools  such as screwdrivers  six inches or less  seems inconsistent with the findings of the 9 11 Commission   The 9 11 Commission report indicates that    m ajor vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation security  These  together with inadequate screening and access controls  continue to present aviation security challenges      Rather than finding a way to reintroduce dangerous items onboard aircraft  I would rather the TSA seek to address outstanding security vulnerabilities previously identified by the 9 11 Commission        New Yorkers realize the serious consequences when terrorists exploit aviation security weaknesses to their advantage   The 9 11 Commission highlighted the fact that box cutters and knives were used to carryout the hijackings aboard aircraft used during the September 11th attacks   While those specific items would remain banned  there is no guarantee the items the TSA seeks to allow onboard could not be used for future attacks   The Association of Flight Attendants  the Federal Law Enforcement Officer  s Association  and some airlines have issued their strong disapproval of the TSA  s planned announcement   From the initial information available  this planned decision would hinder the progress this nation has made to improve aviation safety   I ask that TSA not reintroduce dangerous items onboard commercial aviation aircraft until further information addresses all possible security threats   Further  I believe the Congress must be fully briefed by the Department of Homeland Security and TSA and that Congressional hearings should be held in the coming weeks to address potential security problems associated with this planned announcement        Please do not hesitate to contact my office should additional information become available        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton       CC   Kip Hawley  Administrator  TSA         The Honorable Ted Stevens     Chairman  The Honorable Daniel K  Inouye   Co Chairman       Committee on Commerce  Science and Transportation  508 Dirksen Senate Office Building   United States Senate     Washington  D C  20510       The Honorable Susan Collins     Chairman   The Honorable Joseph Lieberman     Ranking Member  Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs       340 Dirksen Senate Office Building   United States Senate     Washington  D C   20510            Dear Chairman Stevens  Co Chairman Inouye  Chairman Collins  and Senator Lieberman        As you may have seen  the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  announced a plan to allow items such as scissors and tools  four and six inches or less respectively  back onboard commercial aviation flights   My fellow New Yorkers experienced directly what happens when gaps in aviation security are exploited by terrorists   I believe that officials at the highest levels of the Department of Homeland Security owe a clear and convincing case that the decision to allow these items back onboard commercial aviation flights serves the best interests of aviation security and every citizen that will fly in the coming weeks  months  and years        Unfortunately  we received no specific information from the TSA explaining what security rationale exists for reversing the existing policy of barring such items   That the TSA is even considering such a move is alarming given the lethality of the attacks perpetrated by the terrorists aboard the hijacked planes through their use of box cutters and knives   While I applaud the TSA  s efforts to increase attention to explosives detection  decreasing passenger wait time  and construct random patterns to keep those who wish Americans harm from exploiting current security systems  I do not understand why that increased attention must come at the expense of screening out potentially dangerous items        Further  though reports indicate that the TSA believes that enhanced cockpit doors  armed pilots  and federal air marshals will prevent further hijackings  the reintroduction of the currently prohibited items will leave the flying public and flight attendants at risk in the main cabin   The air marshals program is one added measure of security but marshals cannot be present on the thousands of flights that take place everyday   We need to maximize our security against future attacks          I would ask that your Committees look into this matter to ensure that the TSA is not taking a step backward in aviation security   We have made progress in eliminating some of the security vulnerabilities that existed on September 11  2001  and I do not believe we should ease our vigilance in the weeks and months ahead          I thank you for your consideration of this matter and look forward to working with each of you moving forward        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
