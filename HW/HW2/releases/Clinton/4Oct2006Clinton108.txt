October 4  2006 Schumer  Clinton Welcome Final Department of Commerce Decision on Unfair Trade Practices that Hurt Syracuse Candle Industry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Department Issues Final Determination that Certain Chinese Candle Imports Must Be Subject to Import Duty   Decision a Boost to Syracuse Candle Industry that was Continually Hurt by Chinese Candle Makers and U S  Importers Seeking to Avoid Antidumping Tariffs Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed a decision yesterday by the U S  Department of Commerce to require Chinese candle producers to comply with an Antidumping Duty Order on their mixed wax imported candles and pay a 108 3  duty on those imports          The Department of Commerce  s final determination effectively orders a 108 3  duty margin on mixed wax candles that contain up to 87 80  of palm and or other vegetable oil based waxes  The 108 3  duty will be retroactive to February 25  2005  which was when the investigation commenced            This is a great triumph for our domestic candle producers here in Syracuse  Everyone knows that when it comes to trade matters  the Chinese don  t always play by the rules  The Commerce Department came down on the right side of the issue    their decision means that Chinese candle producers must play by the rules  and in turn  we have maintained this important and historic New York industry     Senator Schumer said            This is a real victory for the Syracuse candle making industry   Our manufacturers deserve a level playing field and we owe it to them to make sure that others do not unfairly circumvent our trade laws     Senator Clinton said    Syracuse has a proud history of candle production but attempts by importers to undercut our producers have put that tradition at risk  I am pleased that the Department of Commerce heeded our call to take action against these unfair practices and recognized the importance of this decision to local producers  especially here in Syracuse             Syracuse used to be one of the world  s prime producers of candles  yet their market has steadily declined since the early 1980s    primarily due to Chinese trade practices   Muench Kreuzer  Will   Baumer  and the Cathedral Candle Companies  all located in Syracuse  have alleged that the Chinese have successfully avoided paying antidumping duties on petroleum candles           Earlier this year  Senators Schumer and Clinton joined with a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues  calling on the U S  Department of Commerce to consider the local candle industry before issuing their determination   The senators were concerned about aggressive efforts by Chinese candle producers to circumvent an Antidumping Duty Order on petroleum wax candles and thus avoid paying the 108 3  duty imposed on their illegal dumping  Last year Senators Clinton and Schumer also wrote a letter urging the Department of Commerce to take action and investigate allegations of the Chinese circumvention efforts while expressing great concern towards the potentially irreparable harm these efforts could cause on the U S  candle industry    most notably the candle production in and around Syracuse             A Department of Commerce Fact Sheet on the Final Ruling is below       FACT SHEET      Commerce Finds Mixed Wax Candles Are Later Developed Products of Petroleum Wax Candles               On October 2  the Department of Commerce announced its final determination of circumvention of the antidumping duty order on petroleum wax candles from the People  s Republic of China  PRC               Commerce determined that mixed wax candles composed of petroleum wax and more than 50 percent or more palm and or other vegetable oil based waxes  mixed wax candles  are later developed products of petroleum wax candles              In addition  Commerce has determined that mixed wax candles containing any amount of petroleum are covered by the scope of the antidumping duty order on petroleum wax candles from the PRC              On February 25  2005  Commerce concurrently initiated later developed merchandise and minor alterations anticircumvention inquiries on mixed wax candles  Due to the issuance of the affirmative final determination that mixed wax candles are a later developed product  the minor alterations anticircumvention inquiry has been rescinded  as the products subject to that inquiry have already been determined to be within the scope of the order              The products covered by this order are certain scented or unscented petroleum wax candles made from petroleum wax and having fiber or paper cored wicks  They are sold in the following shapes  tapers  spirals  and straight sided dinner candles  round  columns  pillars  votives  and various wax filled containers  The products were classified under subheading 755 25 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States  The products covered are currently classified under subheading 3406 00 00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  HTSUS   Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes  our written description remains dispositive              From 2004 to 2005  imports of candles from the PRC decreased 32 29  by volume and were valued at an estimated  126 million in 2005        NEXT STEPS           Commerce will require suspension of liquidation of entries of mixed wax candles  containing any amount of petroleum wax  from the PRC that were entered  or withdrawn from warehouse  for consumption on or after February 25  2005  the date of initiation of this anticircumvention inquiry              U S Customs and Border Protection will require a cash deposit in the amount of 108 30 percent for all such unliquidated entries  which is the most recently calculated PRC wide rate              However  interested parties may submit a scope request  pursuant to section 351 225 c  of Commerce  s regulations  regarding whether a certain type of mixed wax candle is outside the scope of the order             FINAL    RATES
