              Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Gordon H  Smith  R OR  today announced the introduction of the New Savers Act   The bill outlines a series of innovative proposals to help increase the personal savings rate  which has been negative for the past two years and at the lowest level since the Great Depression      With the savings rate at near historic lows  Congress needs to look at new ways to help working families and low income households to increase their personal savings   Too many families are living paycheck to paycheck without saving for their futures and too many Americans have not been brought into the financial mainstream   The New Savers Act lays out a series of practical and relatively low cost steps we can implement to help Americans start saving more and create wealth for their kids education  for the purchase of a home and for their retirement  said Senator Clinton    The national savings rate is below zero  painting a grim picture for the future financial security of many Americans  said Senator Smith   Enacting the simple measures identified in this bill would make the difference in encouraging millions of young Americas to start investing in their future       The bill  developed in coordination with the Asset Building Program at the New America Foundation  will among other things  create unique savings accounts for children  enable and encourage greater access to financial services such as checking and savings accounts  incentivize the purchase of U S  savings bonds  enable more families to utilize existing savings incentives such as the Savers Credit  makes sure college savings plans are effective  and ensure that wealth building tools and education are readily available to working families that want to save for their future     A summary of the New Savers Act Follows    Encouraging Savings at Tax Time  To facilitate savings and provide reasonably priced transaction accounts  individual taxpayers will be able to open accounts with their tax returns  Taxpayers will be able to conduct their routine financial activities in a convenient and low cost way through electronic transfers and transaction cards that are connected to the accounts   Taxpayers will also be able to purchase U S  savings bonds directly with their tax return  In addition  the Treasury Department will make available up to  25 million in grants each year to support tax return preparation clinics for low income taxpayers  Finally  the Treasury Secretary will establish national savings performance measures to evaluate the extent to which Americans are saving and using the Federal tax process to facilitate their savings activities     Enabling Access to Financial Services  The Secretaries of the Treasury Department and the Department of Health and Human Services are instructed to undertake a number of programs and strategies to promote access to wealth building financial services  Efforts will focus on encouraging the use of electronic payments  linking benefits cards to savings products  and providing the resources  incentives  training and assistance to connect individuals to a variety of wealth building financial products and services    Roth IRAs for Kids  The earlier children start saving and accumulating assets  the more financially secure they will be throughout life and in retirement  This title creates a tax advantaged childrens savings account similar to a Roth IRA  The current rules for Roth IRAs require owners to have earned income  which most children do not have  so families have no tax benefited  restricted way of saving for their kids first home  college  or retirement   This provision lifts that requirement so that parents  grandparents  and others can contribute to a savings account that will have tax free distributions   Making More Families Eligible for the Savers Credit   The Savers Credit is a nonrefundable tax credit  which matches lower income taxpayers contributions to 401 k  plans  IRAs  and other savings vehicles  To help more eligible families take advantage of the credit and create an incentive to save for higher education  this proposal expands the list of eligible savings vehicles to include Coverdell education savings accounts  and it increases the amount of the savings that is eligible for the credit    Promoting U S  Savings Bonds  U S  Savings Bonds are a valuable tool to promote savings  especially among small savers  This title expands efforts to market and promote access to U S  savings bonds  and creates a tax credit available to employers that facilitate the purchase of savings bonds through their participation in the payroll savings plan    Strengthening Qualified Tuition Savings Plans   Section 529 College Savings Plans  or qualified tuition plans  provide a viable means to save for post secondary education  This title ensures that detailed information on the operation and performance of each states program is made available each year  and an annual report is prepared to assess the use and effectiveness of qualified tuition program in assisting taxpayers  Further  it also creates a grant program to support innovation by states in increasing participation in their programs
