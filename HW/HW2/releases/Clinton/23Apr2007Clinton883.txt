April 23  2007 Statement from President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Death of Boris Yeltsin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Boris Yeltsin was a Russian patriot who believed that democracy was the only way to restore Russia s position of greatness in the 21st Century  Throughout his presidency he worked tirelessly toward that goal  to the detriment of his health  but to the great benefit of his nation  He risked his life to prevent a coup  then pushed Russia forward through economic hardship and political turmoil to partnerships with Cold War adversaries and membership in the G 8          As Presidents  Boris and I met more than 15 times  talked often  and worked closely on a wide range of issues  including terrorism  nuclear proliferation  and preserving peace around the world  We didn t always agree  but I tried to support him in his work and each time we spoke  I was struck by two things  his devotion to his country and its people  and his willingness to look at the facts and make a tough decision he thought was in Russia s long term interest  Fate gave him a tough time in which to govern  but history will be kind to him because he was courageous and steadfast on the big issues   peace  freedom  and progress          Hillary and I are deeply saddened to have lost our friend  who gave us unforgettable memories both funny and profound  Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Naina  the entire Yeltsin family  and the Russian people on this sad day
