July 19  2007 Senator Clinton and Representative Slaughter Introduce National Women s Rights History Project Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Rep  Louise M  Slaughter  D NY 28  today introduced the National Womens Rights History Project Act  a bill designed to provide Americans with the opportunity to learn more about the heroines who fought tirelessly to secure womens rights in the United States  The introduction of the bill coincides with the 159th anniversary of the first Womens Rights Convention in Seneca Falls  New York  which took place on July 18  1848  The National Womens Rights History Project Act is a unique opportunity to enhance public awareness and understanding of the impact of the struggle for womens rights on our lives and our nation  At the same time it is also a great opportunity to preserve our states proud heritage and to promote it to the world  New York has played such an important role in the Womens Rights Movement  from the first womens rights convention in 1848 to the continuing struggle for emancipation and freedom for all  We have a truly unique opportunity to celebrate that heritage while promoting this great state  This Act will encourage Americans of all ages to not only visit New York  but also to revisit and celebrate the role that women have played in our nations history  And by investing in these historic treasures  we can also build on the economic potential of a region where so many momentous events took place  Senator Clinton said  On this day in 1848  a group of women activists convened the first Womens Rights Convention in Seneca Falls  New York  the opening salvo of a 72 year struggle for suffrage  Rep  Slaughter said  Courageous Women like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott fought tirelessly to achieve equitable rights in America  and their campaign has continued through the generations  Weve clearly come a long way since Seneca Falls  but we still have a long way to go   We must work to continue the momentum that began there  not only by ensuring that all women vote  but that they do so with an understanding of the long fight to obtain this right and with a sense of responsibility to do their part in the struggle for womens equality  Elements of the Act  The National Women s Rights History Project Act would achieve three major goals  First  the bill would establish an auto route linking New York State sites significant to the struggle for womens suffrage and civil rights  The route would be administered as part of Womens Rights National Historical Park  and the National Park Service would work to promote historically significant locations along the route  To that end  the Park Service would support the development of a guidebook  a signage system  indoor and outdoor exhibits  and interpretive and educational programs to enrich the experience of visitors  Second  the Act would expand the National Register of Historic Places  online database dedicated to women s history  Places Where Women Made History  The website currently lists locations of historical importance throughout the United States  Rep  Slaughter and Sen  Clinton s legislation will support a collaborative effort incorporating the input of state historic preservation offices nationwide so that a more comprehensive listing of women s history sites can be provided online  along with new and relevant information concerning them  Finally  the Act would require the Department of Interior to establish a partnership based network to offer financial and technical assistance for the development of educational programs focused on national womens rights history  Further Background  Following a National Park Service study requested by Rep  Slaughter examining the feasibility of establishing a Votes for Womens History Trail  Representative Slaughter introduced the Votes for Womens History Trail Act in 2002  with the goal of creating a National Park trail in upstate New York that would link the Womens Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls Waterloo  the Susan B  Anthony House in Rochester  and nearly 20 other locations  including the Michigan Street Baptist Church  the Colored Musicians Club and the Home of Mary B  Talbert in Buffalo  In 2005  Rep  Slaughter introduced the National Womens Rights History Project Act  an expanded version of the Votes for Womens History Trail Act  While continuing to recognize the significant historical sites located in Western New York  the project expanded the scope to account for sites nationwide  The introduction of this year s legislation coincides with the anniversary of a momentous day in history when a group of women s rights activists  including Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott  convened the first Womens Rights Convention in Seneca Falls  NY  The Convention heralded the beginning of a 72 year struggle for womens suffrage  culminating in the 1920 ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote  Recent Work on Behalf of Women s History  Senator Clinton  Senator Clinton has long been an advocate of womens rights and the promotion of New Yorks unique place in the history of womens and workers rights  In 2003  Senator Clinton joined with Representative Slaughter to introduce the Votes for Womens History Trail Act  with the goal of creating a National Park trail in upstate New York that would link the Womens Rights National Historical Park in Seneca Falls Waterloo  the Susan B  Anthony House in Rochester  the Matilda Joslyn Gage House in Fayetteville  and nearly 20 other locations  Since her time as First Lady  Senator Clinton has worked to promote awareness of women s history in New York State and beyond  For example  she has proudly supported the Kate Mullany House in Troy  New York  In 1864  Ms  Mullany and 200 of her fellow female laborers organized the first women s labor union in the U S   the Collar Laundry Union  They successfully launched a strike for an increase in pay  and the Collar Laundry Union continued as an influential regional force  Senator Clinton was successful in having the Kate Mullany House dedicated as a National Historic Site in 2004  In 2003 Senator Clinton also secured  11 750 for the Harriet Tubman Home in Auburn  NY  The funds were made available under the Senate FY  04 Interior Appropriations Bill   The amount was equivalent to the additional amount of widows pension that Harriet Tubman should have received from Jan 1899 to March 1913 under various laws authorizing a pension for the death of her husband  Nelson Davis  a veteran of the Civil War   The funds were aimed at preserving and maintaining her home and to honor her memory  Senator Clinton was inducted into the National Womens Hall of Fame in 2005 and has recently worked to secure preliminary congressional approval of  250 000 for the restoration of the historic Seneca Knitting Mill  the future home of the National Women s Hall of Fame  Rep  Slaughter   Rep  Slaughter has worked for years to help ensure that due recognition is given to the women s movement in the United States  During the 150th anniversary of the first Women s Rights Convention in Seneca Falls in 1998  Rep  Slaughter organized a delegation of current and former women Members of Congress to participate in these and related events in Rochester  NY   She served as an active facilitator and advisor in planning the Seneca Falls 150th anniversary events  and joined then First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the stage to speak during the celebration s inaugural ceremonies  In July 2000  Rep  Slaughter was honored to be elected Chair of the Women s Progress Commemoration Commission  WPCC   a body created by legislation she had previously authored and successfully passed through Congress in 1998   In 2001  during the events commemorating the 153rd anniversary of the First Women s Rights Convention  Rep  Slaughter was proud to release the final report and recommendations of the WPCC at the Women s Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls  NY   The report  available here  outlined seven important steps that can be taken to preserve sites important to women s history  In Washington  Rep  Slaughter spoke in 2004 at the unveiling of the portrait of former Congresswoman Mary Norton  1875 1959   now located in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi s office  The event took place during Women s History Month  Rep  Slaughter also worked to move the historic Women s Suffrage Statue of Susan B  Anthony  Lucretia Mott  and Elizabeth Cady Stanton from the Capitol s basement into the Capitol Rotunda  and spoke at a celebration marking the new placement of the monument
