March 2  2005 Senator Clinton Condemns Syrian Support for Terrorism  Urges Tighter Sanctions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Speaking to the Jewish Council for Public Affairs in Washington  DC yesterday  Senator Clinton called for tougher sanctions against Syria  expressing concern about Syria s increasingly aggressive position in the region and saying that a clear message must be sent that terrorist activity will not be tolerated    Excerpts of Senator Clinton s remarks to the Jewish Council for Public Affairs follow     In this critical time  it is important that we recognize the extraordinary stand that Prime Minister Sharon and the Government of Israel have taken as they face the risks and challenges of disengagement and attempt to try to deal with the newly elected Palestinian Leadership      We were all horrifically reminded last Friday in Tel Aviv  that there are still many who do not want there to be any kind of forward progress  who not only commit acts of nihilistic violence  but are hoping that by so doing  to create conditions that are impossible for any positive move forward       We also have to be aware  that it s not only a dangerous neighborhood  but a neighborhood in which very few of the neighbors are committed to what Prime Minister Sharon is doing or what we hope will come from the Palestinian Leadership  particularly Iran and Syria who continue to try to upset the balance in the region and pose such great threats  not only to peace and stability  but in Iran s case  with the potential of a nuclear capacity and in Syria s case with the continuation of the support for terrorism that flows from Damascus      I ve been particularly troubled by Syria s aggressive posture in the region  and along with a bipartisan group of Senators  I have sent a letter to President Bush urging him to tighten sanctions on Syria     because we need to send a very clear message that we will not tolerate what we believe to be and have reason to know  is the continuing support of terrorism that comes out of Syria and Iran       Late last month  Senator Clinton joined Senators Frank Lautenberg  NJ   Gordon Smith  OR  and others  in calling on President Bush to tighten sanctions against Syria under the Syria and Lebanese Sovereignty Act of 2003  The Act gives the President the discretion to adjust the level of sanctions on Syria  This is the legislation on which the May 2004 trade sanctions against Syria were imposed  In their letter  the Senators also cited Syria s failure to secure the Iraq border  its refusal to remove its troops from Lebanon and its practice of harboring leaders who order  plan  and finance terror attacks against Israeli citizens  as further grounds for immediate action     The full text of the letter to President Bush follows    February 17  2005   The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW  Washington  DC  20500   Dear President Bush      In light of this week s assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut  we urge you to tighten sanctions on Syria   Our message to the Syrians  and to other undemocratic regimes in the region  must be clear and direct  terrorist activity will not be tolerated    The Syria and Lebanese Sovereignty Act of 2003  on which you based your May 2004 trade sanctions against Syria  was passed in response to Syria s support for terrorism  its occupation of Lebanon  and its pursuit of dangerous weapons   As you know  the legislation we passed gives you the discretion to adjust the level of sanctions on Syria    Neither the U S  nor our allies can afford to let Syria off the hook   The Syrians have failed to secure the Iraq border  permitting the infiltration of foreign terrorists into Iraq   Syria continues to harbor leaders who order  plan  and finance terror attacks against Israeli citizens   Operatives of the Islamic Jihad  Hamas  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  and the al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades regularly receive training in Syrian camps   In addition to its sponsorship of terrorism  the government of Syria has ignored and violated multiple U N  resolutions by refusing to remove its troops from Lebanon   As long as Syria continues to occupy Lebanon and train suicide bombers  the region is not safe    In order to demonstrate our nation s intolerance for terrorism  we urge you to take strong action against Syria   We also urge you to reach out to our allies around the world to encourage them to stand firm against Syria s actions and policies    Sincerely    Sen  Allen   Sen  Smith   Sen  Hutchison   Sen  Brownback   Sen  Kyl   Sen  Lautenberg   Sen  Clinton   Sen  Wyden   Sen  Ben Nelson   Sen  Bill Nelson   Sen  Schumer
