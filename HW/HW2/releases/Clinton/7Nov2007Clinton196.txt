                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that a Joint House and Senate Conference Committee has approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Veterans Affairs and Military Construction Appropriations bill  which includes  35 5 million in veterans and military construction funding for Central New York  The funds include  6 6 million for the Northeast Air Defense Sector  NEADS  in Rome   5 1 million for Hancock Field Air National Guard Base in Syracuse  and  23 8 million for the Spinal Cord Injury  SCI  Center at the Syracuse VA Medical Center    The funding includes  23 8 million for the Spinal Cord Injury Center that was proposed in the Presidents Fiscal Year 2008 Budget and provides an additional  11 7 million approved by the conference committee for military construction at NEADS and Hancock Field Air National Guard Base  The bill  having been approved by the Conference Committee  must now be approved by both chambers of Congress  If it is passed by the House and Senate it will then be sent to the President for his signature    This is terrific news for Central New York  and another key step in the appropriations process  said Senator Schumer  These vital funds will ensure that troops throughout the area have access to the most cutting edge technology and facilities  as well as providing our veterans with the top notch care they deserve    This is great news for Central New York and for our veterans and men and women in uniform  Senator Clinton said  These funds will provide important support to these vital projects  giving our veterans the services they deserve and keeping our national defense strong  I look forward to the President signing this bill into law    The  35 5 million for Central New York in the Military Construction FY 2008 Appropriations bill includes   Northeast Air Defense Sector  NEADS   Rome  Construct NEADS Support Facility    6 6 million    Funding for this project was initially included as part of the Fiscal Year 2007 Veterans Affairs and Military Construction Appropriations bill  which was not completed and signed into law   The Northeast Air Defense Sector  NEADS  requires a new Support facility to replace aging facilities  which are currently not co located  and to improve force protection of assigned resources   This is a two phase construction project with Phase I having been approved and supported with  3 million in FY 2006 military construction funding   The NEADS is located on the former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome   Unit personnel are housed in three different locations   Relocating the Headquarters building inside the Sector Operations Control Center  SOCC  Compound and moving personnel from Depot 1 to this building will improve protection of NEADS personnel and facilities   Hancock Field Air National Guard Base  Syracuse  Upgrade Base Facilities    5 1 million    The 274th Air Support Operations Squadron  ASOS  and 152nd Air Operations Group  AOG  require a properly sized and configured facility   The two organizations are hosted by the 174th Fighter Wing and are housed jointly in a 22 500 square foot facility built in 2000   Both organizational missions have grown considerably  both in size and in operational responsibility in recent years   The 274th ASOS is expanding its personnel strength and its equipment package has nearly doubled in size in the last five years   The 152nd AOG likewise has expanded in total personnel and its requirements for secure and non secure training and storage space has grown considerably   A larger facility or facilities is urgently needed to effectively train and prepare these organizations for their wartime missions   This will ensure adequate space exists to support both missions   Syracuse VA Medical Center  Syracuse  Construction of Spinal Cord Injury Center    23 8 million    This is the final phase of funding for the VAs effort to construct a 30 bed Spinal Cord Injury  SCI  Center at the Syracuse VA Medical Center   Currently  there is no space available within the main hospital building to allow effective incorporation of SCI patients  and this project will resolve longstanding deficiencies in the SCI program at the Syracuse VA   Completion of funding for this effort will serve to enhance the quality of life for Central New York veterans and will leverage sharing agreements already in place with Fort Drum to contribute to a smooth transition for our troops out of the Department of Defense and into the VA
