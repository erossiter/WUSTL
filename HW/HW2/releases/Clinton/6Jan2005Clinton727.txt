January 6  2005 Clinton Announces Passage of Bill that Makes is  Easier for Americans to Donate to Tsunami Relief                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  joins with Senator Max Baucus  MT  in announcing the passage of legislation that will help encourage private contributions to the tsunami victims  This bill is a tax proposal that will extend the period of time Americans can make charitable donations in order to assist victims of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit Southeast Asia on December 26          As the efforts to raise financial support for the victims of this tragedy continue  it is important that as much relief as possible is secured in these coming  critical weeks in order to prevent further catastrophe   Senator Clinton said   Many New Yorkers have had family members and friends affected by this disaster and everything must be done in order to move the relief and recovery efforts forward  I commend the Senate for its prompt consideration of this measure  and I am proud that this legislation will build upon the abundant goodwill of the American people and will help ensure that this much needed aid is delivered as quickly as possible  I encourage President Bush to sign this bill into law immediately  time is of the essence   Clinton added        Under this proposal  taxpayers will be permitted to claim a tax deduction in tax year 2004 for donations made for tsunami disaster relief until January 31  2005  Under current law  taxpayers would have to wait until 2006 season to claim a tax deduction for tsunami related gifts made after December 31  2004  The proposal will be limited to cash gifts made specifically for disaster relief        Organizations coordinating relief efforts have specifically asked for cash donations  Cash donations reduce shipping costs of relief items being transported from the United States and allow cash to flow into local economies stimulating growth  This tax proposal will give Americans an added incentive to donate immediately and provide charities with cash support         A little over a week ago  the world endured a tragedy of epic proportions   said Baucus   Americans want to know how they can help to alleviate the pain suffered by victims of this disaster and rewarding them with a tax deduction will make it easier for cash donations to reach those in need quickly  Giving individuals an even greater incentive to give during the next month will help mobilize the great relief work currently underway in Southeast Asia
