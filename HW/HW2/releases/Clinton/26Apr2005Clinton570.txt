                                                                                                                                                                                                                       President  s Budget proposes cut of  450 million to vital funding program for nation  s firefighters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    Continuing her fight against cuts to vital federal funds for New York  s firefighters  Senator Clinton has urged Senate Appropriations Committee members to restore funding in the FY 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill   Several programs that send funds directly to firehouses across the state and the nation suffered massive funding cuts in the President  s Budget   Senator Clinton is working to have those funds restored in the Senate Appropriations process        Specifically  Senator Clinton joined a bi partisan group of her Senate colleagues  writing to the Chairman and Ranking Members of the Senate Appropriations Sub Committee on Homeland Security  urging them to restore funding for the Assistance to Firefighter Grants  AFG  program under the Fire Investment and Response Enhancement  FIRE  Act and Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response firefighters  SAFER  Act included in the Fiscal Year 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill        The President  s recent budget proposal included a cut of  450 million in funding for next year  s FIRE Act program nationwide as compared to what Congress authorized and no funding at all for programs under the SAFER Act   In the letter  the Senator called on the subcommittee on Homeland Security to provide an additional  450 million for the FIRE Act and  750 million for the SAFER Act          Given the critical job that firefighters perform each and every day  I am disappointed and quite frankly perplexed by the President  s proposed cuts to the Fire Act in the 2006 Budget proposal     Senator Clinton said    These programs provide the necessary resources for the men and women in the public safety community who put their lives on the line everyday and they should not be shortchanged  I urge my colleagues to think of the resources  equipment and training that will be lost to our firefighters if they do not restore this funding           The Assistance to Firefighters Grant program  otherwise known as the FIRE Act Grant program  is administered by the Department of Homeland Security s Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness  SLGCP   The AFG program assists rural  urban and suburban fire departments throughout the United States  These funds are used by the nation s firefighters to increase the effectiveness of firefighting and emergency response operations and to improve firefighter health and safety programs with assistance for firefighter equipment and training  Almost every week  grants are made available under the FIRE Act to fire companies throughout New York  The SAFER Grants provide funding for the hiring of fire personnel and incentives for volunteer recruitment and retention         Since the details of the President  s Budget proposal came down last month  Senator Clinton has been fighting to have the funding restored to these vital funding programs for firefighters  Senator Clinton has met with firefighters from across the state and during the Budget Resolution debate she co sponsored an amendment with Senator Debbie Stabenow  D MI  in an attempt to restore the cuts          To find out how much each county in New York has been awarded under the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program since its inception in 2001  go to http   www firegrantsupport com winners aspx      Copies of the Senators  letters are attached        April 21  2005          The Honorable Judd Gregg   Chairman       Subcommittee on Homeland Security   Committee on Appropriations    United States Senate   Washington  DC 20510       The Honorable Robert Byrd  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  DC 20510       Dear Chairman Gregg and Senator Byrd         As the Subcommittee prepares to mark up the fiscal year 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill  we respectfully request that you include funding for the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Firefighters  SAFER  Act    an initiative that provides critical hiring assistance to our nation  s firefighters         The SAFER Act  which was enacted in November  2003  provides assistance to fire departments in hiring new firefighter    both paid and volunteer   According to the benchmark standards issued by the National Fire Protection Association  a super majority of fire departments lack the number of personnel necessary to fight fires and to respond to other emergencies effectively   This problem plagues cities and towns of all sizes in all parts of the country   The SAFER Act would help mitigate this problem by enabling fire departments to hire up to 75 000 paid and volunteer firefighters over the next seven fiscal years         In fiscal year 2005  Congress provided  65 million in SAFER Act support   Regrettably  the President  s fiscal year 2006 budget requests no assistance for activities authorized by the SAFER Act   Therefore  we are writing to request that the Subcommittee on Homeland Security provide  750 million for the SAFER Act         Our firefighter are first rate and they risk their lives each and everyday to ensure our safety   Like our troops overseas  they deserve the best equipment  best training  and adequate personnel to do their jobs   We thank you for your favorable consideration of this request               Sincerely                  April 21  2005       The Honorable Judd Gregg   Chairman       Subcommittee on Homeland Security   Committee on Appropriations    United States Senate   Washington  DC 20510       The Honorable Robert Byrd  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  Washington  DC 20510         Dear Chairman Gregg and Senator Byrd         As the Subcommittee prepares to mark up the fiscal year 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill  we respectfully request that you include funding for the Fire Investment and Response Enhancement  FIRE  Act    an important initiative that provides critical assistance to our nation  s firefighters         Initially authorized in fiscal year 2001  the FIRE Act is the first Congressional initiative specifically designed to help meet the needs of fire departments and firefighters across the country   Over the past four years  the FIRE Act has provided over  2 billion in assistance to over 15 000 fire departments in all fifty States   These resources have enabled fire departments to obtain updated firefighting equipment and improve firefighter training    two activities that are crucial towards ensuring that firefighters carry out their expanded responsibilities in this post 9 11 world         In fiscal year 2004 alone  there were over 20 000 FIRE Act applications submitted  totaling over  2 66 billion in grant requests   Last year  congress provided  650 million in FIRE Act support   Regrettably  the President  s fiscal year 2006 budget requests only  500 million in FIRE Act assistance   Therefore  we are writing to request that the Subcommittee on Homeland Security provide an additional  450 million above the President  s budget request for the FIRE Act         Our firefighter are first rate and they risk their lives each and everyday to ensure our safety   Like our troops overseas  they deserve the best equipment  best training  and adequate personnel to do their jobs   We thank you for your favorable consideration of this request               Sincerely
