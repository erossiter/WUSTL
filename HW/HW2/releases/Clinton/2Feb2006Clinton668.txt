February 2  2006 Senator Clinton Responds to EPA  s Failure to Protect New Yorkers Post 9 11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Click here to watch Senator Clinton s statement   Today s decision reinforces what I have said all along  That EPA failed in its duty to protect New Yorkers from the dangerous cloud of toxic materials that was released on September 11th  that the White House edited EPA s statements to downplay the risks posed by the contaminants in that cloud  and that EPA has failed to implement an adequate testing program to assess whether there are ongoing risks posed by indoor contamination in New York            This is outrageous   New Yorkers were depending on the federal government to provide them with accurate information about the air they were breathing   And they are still depending on the federal government to assess the level of ongoing risk            So I will continue to push for an investigation into the EPA s failure to establish an effective  science based testing and clean up plan in response to the post 9 11 environmental disaster   And I continue to believe that the White House owes New Yorkers an explanation
