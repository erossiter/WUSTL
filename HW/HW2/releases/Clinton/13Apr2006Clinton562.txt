                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NYPD detective  s death   directly related   to Ground Zero work        Urges legislation to retroactively reclassify others who later die from Ground Zero related illness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    U S  Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Charles E  Schumer  D NY  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today called on New York Governor George Pataki and other Empire State legislative leaders to pass legislation providing full death benefits to the orphan of an NYPD detective who died from an illness directly related to his work at Ground Zero following 9 11  The senators said the legislation should allow   retroactive reclassification     which would pay full benefits to the beneficiaries of all those who die from injuries later linked to their work at Ground Zero          James Zadroga  a New Jersey resident at the time of his death  was an NYPD detective who died recently due to complications that doctors say stem directly from his work at Ground Zero following the 9 11 attacks  He became ill just weeks after working at Ground Zero  but because he retired in 2004  the New York Police Department has determined that his four year old daughter Tylerann can only receive a disability pension  instead of the full death benefit to which she should be entitled  The senators called on New York officials to provide full benefits to Tylerann and other beneficiaries like her              All of our constituents take great pride in the heroism they displayed  and we also join in demanding that their service not be forgotten     the lawmakers wrote     We urge you and the New York State Legislature to enact legislation immediately that allows for retroactive reclassification  which would provide Tylerann and other families the benefits they are due             Governor Pataki last year signed legislation into law that extends disability benefits to workers who sustained injuries from their duties at Ground Zero  The bill also created a September 11th Worker Protection Task Force to   review and examine evidence about adverse health effects on workers who participated in the World Trade Center efforts     This Task Force was created to identify federal sources of funding to provide the benefits conferred by the bill              Unfortunately  Detective Zadroga  s death will not be the last to be suffered by the brave Americans who rushed to Ground Zero in the hours and days after September 11     the lawmakers said    In the months ahead  we hope we can work together to ensure that the heroes from both our states who sacrificed their health    and in Detective Zadroga  s case  his life    will be justly compensated            We owe them nothing less                     April 13  2006      The Honorable George E  Pataki  Governor  State of New York  State Capitol  Albany  NY 12224    Dear Governor Pataki       We are writing regarding the death of New York City Police Detective James Zadroga  who at the time of his passing was a New Jersey resident   A recent autopsy determined that his death was directly related to his exposure to airborne toxic fumes and dust at Ground Zero in the days and weeks following the September 11th terrorist attacks    the first time a medical examiner has found that the work performed by so many at Ground Zero has resulted in death          Detective Zadroga served with great courage in the line of duty and paid the ultimate sacrifice for his heroism   He became ill just weeks after working at Ground Zero  but because he retired in 2004  the New York Police Department has determined that his four year old daughter  Tylerann  can only receive a disability pension  instead of the full death benefit to which she should be entitled   Detective Zadroga  s death left Tylerann an orphan who will now be raised by her grandparents   Her family needs your assistance in securing for Tylerann the benefits that her late father so clearly earned   Make no mistake about it   Detective Zadroga died in the line of duty  and his family should be afforded the benefits that status carries             Unfortunately  Detective Zadroga  s death will not be the last to be suffered by the brave Americans who rushed to Ground Zero in the hours and days after September 11   Many of the police officers  firefighters  and other rescue workers were New Jerseyans and New Yorkers   All of our constituents take great pride in the heroism they displayed  and we also join in demanding that their service not be forgotten   We urge you and the New York State Legislature to enact legislation immediately that allows for retroactive reclassification  which would provide Tylerann and other families the benefits they are due           Last year  you signed into law legislation that  among other things  established the September 11 Worker Protection Task Force to review evidence on the adverse health effects to workers who participated in the World Trade Center efforts   This Task Force was created to identify federal sources of funding to provide the benefits conferred by the bill   We hope you will ensure that this Task Force is up and running as soon as possible            In the months ahead  we hope we can work together to ensure that the heroes from both our states who sacrificed their health    and in Detective Zadroga  s case  his life    will be justly compensated   We owe them nothing less          Sincerely       ROBERT MENENDEZ  FRANK R  LAUTENBERG  CHARLES SCHUMER  HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
