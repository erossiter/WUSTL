July 17  2007 Statement of Senator Clinton on the Resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Secretary Jim Nicholsons resignation from the Department of Veterans Affairs offers the President an opportunity to usher in new leadership at the Department   It is my hope that the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs will serve as a true advocate for our veterans and champion the many challenges they face   It is time that we do much more to show our veterans  not just tell them  that we are grateful for their service to our country by providing guaranteed full funding for VA health care  smoothing the transition of service members out of the military and into the VA system  reducing the backlog of veterans benefits claims  eliminating the unfair prohibition on concurrent receipt of disability and retirement benefits  ensuring that our veterans have access to the care needed to address traumatic brain injury and post traumatic stress disorder  and significantly expanding GI Bill education  housing and entrepreneurial benefits that are commensurate with the sacrifice they have made on our behalf
