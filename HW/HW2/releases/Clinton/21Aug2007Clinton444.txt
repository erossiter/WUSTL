August 21  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Bush Plan to Undermine State Efforts to Provide Healthcare for Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   We should not punish children and their families who need healthcare coverage  but that is exactly what the President is proposing  The Presidents policy would undermine efforts to provide healthcare for uninsured children in New York and other states  including those where it costs more to provide the same coverage and treatment a child would receive elsewhere in our country  Every child deserves a healthy start in life and we should be doing everything we can to extend access to quality  affordable health care for the more than nine million children who are uninsured  Both the House and the Senate recently passed legislation to strengthen and expand the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  and the actions of President Bush are an attempt to undermine and negate the bipartisan efforts of Congress  CHIP has been a real success story and I am proud to have helped launch this program during the Clinton Administration  We should build on its success and help states provide needed coverage  not sabotage state efforts to provide healthcare for our children I will continue to work with New York State and my colleagues in Congress to make sure children and families in New York continue to benefit from this important program
