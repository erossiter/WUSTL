                 Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report filed late yesterday included approved  18 9 million for military projects in Central New York  The House and Senate must approve the bill before being sent to the President and signed into law            This is great news for Central New York   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put Central New York and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Central New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge             This is wonderful news for Central New York  This is cutting edge defense technology being made locally  supporting our men and women in uniform and our national security  These are important investments in local companies and research institutions that will in turn help the economy as well  I look forward to their final approval by the Senate     Senator Clinton said          Funding in the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill includes          Source Sentinel    Detection of Biological Agents in Water    1 5 million    This funding will allow Source Sentinel to further their project on the Detection of Biological Agents in Water  This project will support the research  development  application and commercialization of basic and applied research to deploy biosensors to protect water and air systems against man made natural toxin incursion with near real time alert  information fusion and automatic manual response reaction in order to assure protection of municipal water supplies  If implemented successfully  the project has the potential to provide detection and alert capability for the over 4 000 uncovered reservoirs and 15 000 water treatment facilities nationwide  Designed to be deployed on a buoy  on a submerged fixture or in a potable water pump station  the device provides continuous real time monitoring via air and water quality sensors that are able to detect and provide ample near real time warning of the presence of agents that are potential biological terrorism agents  These technologies will be able to provide ample near real time warning of the presence of inorganic and organic chemicals and specific bacteria in air or water  and will provide an integrated response system that aids an alerted operator in the conduct of the correct emergency action plan measures and procedures in the event of a toxin incursion into the air and water supply from before or at the intake        Rome Labs ITT Space Systems   MASINT Warfighter Tools    1 5 million     This funding for Air Force Research Laboratory  AFRL  Rome Research Labs and ITT Space Systems Division will help them to further their Measurement and Signals Intelligence  MASINT  project  MASINT offers huge benefits in identifying obscured and hidden targets  but the near term challenge is to integrate MASINT into existing and future information processing systems in a way that enables users to manage and display the information in time to take action  MASINT gathers measurements from unintentional radiation  effluent and debris sampling  acoustic signals  non visible imaging and other sources and then subjects that data to specialized processing in order to transform it into actionable intelligence for both national command and tactical users  This funding would allow the AFRL Rome Research Site to build upon the initial success of the MASINT Visualization Tools Program and allow an expansion into newer  less mature techniques such as hyperspectral  acoustic and overhead non imaging infrared  It will also expedite the integration of MASINT into the information architectures of other national security agencies        Syracuse Research Corporation    Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Base Protection  LCMR BP  Systems    1 million     The Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar  LCMR  operates in the battlefield today  protecting the war fighter from mortars and rockets  By networking LCMRs and or other sensors together in the Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Base Protection  LCMR BP  System  the safety of our soldiers will be increased and the accuracy of our responses will be greatly enhanced  The LCMR BP will provide scalable  low cost high reliability forward operating base protection that can handle a variety of threat situations with greater reliability to warn and respond        Syracuse Research Corporation    Reasoning and Assessment of Intelligence for Counter Narcotics and Anti Terrorism  RAINCOAT     1 7 million     The Reasoning and Assessment of Intelligence for Counter Narcotics and Anti Terrorism  RAINCOAT  project provides the U S  Air Force with an operator focused decision support tool  RAINCOAT is a software application that will assist in the detection  identification  and monitoring of drug  insurgent  and terrorism activities  RAINCOAT integrates information from multiple intelligence sources and compresses the intelligence reporting timeline for SENIOR SCOUT operators  This capability directly supports SENIOR SCOUT operators for their ongoing anti terrorism and counter drug missions in the Middle East and South America       The Cortland Companies    Synthetic Material Arresting Cable    1 million    This funding will continue existing efforts to investigate the use of lightweight  synthetic materials and novel cable construction to replace the steel cables that recover aircraft aboard U S  Navy Aircraft Carriers  This testing includes  fatigue testing and analysis at a Navy Test Site that is representative of shipboard gear  design improvements based on fatigue tests  development of synthetic material sheaves and model development and validation in order to quantify performance benefits associated with synthetic cable  Synthetic cables could improve the factor of safety of the entire system by 60   Because the strength to weight of synthetic materials is 4 5 times better than steel  system inertia is significantly reduced  enabling the arresting gear to apply breaking force much earlier in the stroke  The use of synthetic cable also possesses a potential weight savings of 62 tons per carrier and increase arresting gear performance by 25         ATK Alliant Techsystems   Air National Guard RC 26B Modernization Program at Hancock Field    3 6 million    The RC 26B is a twin turbo prop aircraft used by the Air National Guard in Counter Drug and border security operations   It supported national disaster relief in post Katrina missions by providing important real time image collection to disaster relief agencies   The Air National Guard s RC 26Bs also provides the Active and Guard components with ISR capabilities for a variety of missions   The aircraft need real time sensor and communications capabilities  improve reliability and operational flexibility   Funding is needed in FY07 to address Air National Guard modernization requirements for the aircrafts at Hancock Field         Research Associates of Syracuse   Increased Combat Effectiveness Using EW Sensors    1 1 million
