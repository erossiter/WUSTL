July 26  2007 Senator Clinton Presses for Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Museum to be Built in Oyster Bay                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today appealed to James Bruns  President of the Theodore Roosevelt Association  to choose Oyster Bay as the site to build the anticipated Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Museum and Research Center  In a letter to President Bruns  Senator Clinton said she could think of no more fitting tribute to President Roosevelt than to place this museum in the state of his birth and the town where he and his wife Edith chose to raise their family    Oyster Bay would be the perfect place to build this museum  said Senator Clinton after sending her letter   Building it where there is already so much Teddy Roosevelt history would give visitors the full experience of the great man and would bring even more visitors to the area   Teddy Roosevelt spent most of his life in Sagamore Hill  and it was chosen as his final resting place   I cant think of a better place to put such a fitting tribute to such a great American    The Theodore Roosevelt Association is currently weighing different proposals as to where to build the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Museum and Research Center   As of now  the proposed sites are Oyster Bay  Cambridge  MA  and Washington  DC   The facility would not be a Presidential Library  as books and documents that the association has acquired over the years have been donated to Harvard and the Library of Congress   The museum would be an experiential and interactive museum  with exhibits meant for people to explore the legacy of President Roosevelt    A copy of Senator Clintons letter follows        July 26  2007   Mr  James Bruns  President  Theodore Roosevelt Association  Post Office Box 719  Oyster Bay  New York 11771   Dear Mr  Bruns    It is my understanding that there are three sites being considered by the Theodore Roosevelt Association for construction of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Museum and Research Center  Oyster Bay  New York  Cambridge  Massachusetts  and Washington  D C   A museum dedicated to this remarkable American is long overdue and I strongly urge you to choose Oyster Bay as the museum site   I can think of no more fitting tribute to President Roosevelt than to place this museum in the state of his birth and the town where he and his wife Edith chose to raise their family     Oyster Bay has so much to offer as the museum site   Already there are 55 000  60 000 visitors to Sagamore Hill each year   The Theodore Roosevelt Museum would increase the educational value and enhance the visits of those eager to learn about President Roosevelts presidency and his family   The residents of Oyster Bay have a long history of pride in their connection to President Roosevelt   The Museum would be a welcome addition to Oyster Bays already existing Roosevelt site    I give my strongest support to the selection of Oyster Bay as the location of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Museum   I can think of no finer day in Oyster Bay than the dedication of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Museum    Sincerely yours   Hillary Rodham Clinton
