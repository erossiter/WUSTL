September 22  2005 Clinton Again Urges Department of Veterans   Affairs to Reconsider Transfer of Services From Montrose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Transfer of Psychiatric and Long Term Care Inpatient Services from Montrose to Castle Point Could Undermine Care for Area Veterans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   Senator Clinton today again urged the Department of Veterans   Affairs to rethink the ill considered decision to transfer psychiatric and long term care inpatient services from the Montrose VA hospital to the Castle Point facility   Senator Clinton underscored her long standing opposition to consolidating the facilities in testimony conducted by telephone today for a Local Advisory Panel hearing held as part of the VA  s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  project            I oppose the VA  s ill considered decision to transfer psychiatric and long term care in patient services from the Montrose campus to the Castle Point campus   At this time  when we are seeing so many sacrifices  injuries and difficulties by our brave troops serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  I think it sends the wrong message to propose drastic changes in veterans   health care                 Senator Clinton underscored the importance of ensuring that VA s planning process for the Montrose and Castle Point VA hospitals is fully transparent  She noted her leading role in the congressional debate over the CARES process and in particular  the concerns raised over the VA  s planning for long term and mental health care   As a result of that debate  Congress expressed concern that the recommendations of the CARES Commission could lead to a reduction in long term care and mental health services and expressed Congress  s expectation that the VA should expedite the strategic planning process          However  the VA is moving forward with plans to shift inpatient long term care services from Montrose to Castle Point  apparently without having completed the strategic planning process for long term care   Senator Clinton noted that just last month  the US Government Accountability Office reported that   it is unclear whether VA has adequate information on the number of veterans who will seek inpatient long term care    from VA each day because the models it was using had not been revised and finalized as needed          Senator Clinton also urged that the transportation challenges faced by seniors and disabled veterans in the Hudson Valley take a prominent role in the CARES deliberations   Many who rely on the Montrose VA for services could have great difficulty making the trip to the Castle Point VA              I urge the panel to take into account all of these factors and listen to the voices of New York veterans             Senator Clinton has fought for New York s veterans throughout the CARES process  In April  Senator Clinton met with VA Secretary Nicholson to reiterate her serious concerns regarding the VA CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study yet more changes in New York s VA facilities  Secretary Nicholson agreed to consider the points she raised in opposition to the consolidation of the Montrose and Castle Point VAs           Throughout her time in the Senate  Senator Clinton has been working hard to protect the interests of New York s veterans    to provide full funding for veterans  health care  to make mandatory the funding of VA health care and to keep New York VA hospitals open            A copy of Senator Clinton  s testimony submitted to the hearing follows          Distinguished members of the Panel  let me thank you for allowing me to present testimony on the consequences the Department of Veterans Affairs Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services Project  CARES  would have on the veterans of New York and the people who serve their needs at these institutions            As I explained in my testimony for your first meeting  I oppose the VA  s ill considered decision to transfer psychiatric and long term care inpatient services from the Montrose campus to the Castle Point campus          At this time in our nation  s history  with U S  troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation  Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and not implement recommendations that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care          As a starting point  our bottom line goal should be the delivery of high quality health care services to our veterans  delivered as efficiently as possible  Veterans   health care is too important an issue to require an adherence to artificial deadlines and hasty recommendations   With literally the lives of veterans at stake  the panel should not engage in a rush to judgment over closing or reducing services at VA facilities and should not elevate financial considerations over the needs of our veterans           I would like to reiterate how absolutely essential it is that during this phase in the process  the VA s planning process for the Montrose and Castle Point VA s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process  It is the veterans who must remain at the center of this process          As I mentioned in my previous testimony  on April 19th  I met with VA Secretary Jim Nicholson and handed him a letter in which I reiterated my serious concerns regarding the VA  s CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study further changes in New York  s VA facilities   He agreed to consider the serious concerns I raised regarding the Montrose and Castle Point VA  s          The CARES process in my view has been a rushed process that did not adequately heed the voices of New York  s veterans            Former VA Secretary Anthony Principi  s CARES Decision Document  Decisions Document   issued in May 2004  directed VA to   transfer acute psychiatric  long term psychiatric  and nursing home beds from the Montrose to the Castle Point campus              The PricewaterhouseCoopers  PwC  proposals address these directives          Additional analysis is necessary before closing these in patient services at Montrose and shifting additional patient care to Castle Point            The Decisions Document explicitly calls for the development of plans for a new nursing home using   its long term care and mental health strategic plans               Yet just last month  the US Government Accountability Office reported that   it is unclear whether VA has adequate information on the number of veterans who will seek inpatient long term care    from VA each day because the models it was using had not been revised and finalized as needed   The GAO report adds that VA also has not made policy decisions on which veterans it will seek to serve with regard to nursing home care and which services it will offer   Indeed  the VA does not appear to have completed its strategic plan for long term care          Proceeding with such drastic changes at New York s facilities calls into question the VA s commitment to follow congressional intent   As the result of the introduction of the Clinton Enzi CARES amendment to the Fiscal Year 2004 Senate VA HUD appropriations bill  the House Senate conferees specifically stated in the Fiscal Year 2004 Consolidated Appropriations conference report that they  are concerned that the realignment recommendations of the CARES Commission may lead to a reduction in long term care  domiciliary care  and mental health services  The VA is expected to expedite the strategic planning process for these services  Based on the Secretary s statements the conferees urge that no closures or reduction in long term care  domiciliary care  and mental health services  will take place until the full analysis is completed   In addition  in November 2003  former Secretary Principi pledged  no net reduction in VA s capacity to provide inpatient mental health and long term care prior to completion of a comprehensive assessment of veterans  need for these services           Faulty VA projections regarding the number of servicemembers returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom was reportedly one of the reasons the VA had to make enormous revisions in its recent health care budget projections  at least with respect to this fiscal year   Another unknown is the extent to which the returning veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom    many of whom have suffered serious injury and will need lifelong care    are being accurately considered in VA  s projections   It is our solemn obligation to take care of these servicemembers who have given so much on behalf of our Nation          Moreover  moving inpatient services from Montrose to Castle Point will no doubt require substantial sums of federal funding   My office is not aware of any analysis showing how veterans will get services if future budgets do not include enough funds for the transition          Further  the challenges of travel faced by seniors and disabled veterans in the Hudson Valley should take a prominent role in your deliberations   Many who rely on the Montrose VA could find it extremely difficult to make the trip to the Castle Point VA           Our nation made a pact with those who serve their country in the Armed Forces    a commitment that those who served would have access to quality health care through the VA hospital system   To reiterate an important point  it seems premature to be making these proposals when the GAO has recently stated that it is unclear whether the VA has adequate information on future demand for inpatient long term care and has yet to decide how it intends to address such demand   Thus  the VA  s ill considered decision to consolidate the Montrose and Castle Point VA  s threatens to undermine our commitment to our nation  s veterans   I urge the Panel to take into account the proper factors and input from veterans  I believe that if you listen to the voices of New York  s veterans  you will make the right decisions for our veterans          Thank you
