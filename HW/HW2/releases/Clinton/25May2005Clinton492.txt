May 25  2005 Senator Clinton Calls On FDA and CPSC to Work Together to Prevent Food Related Choking Deaths of Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    In the wake of the tragic loss of two young children in New York who choked on a particular brand of candy  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is urging the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CPSC  and the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  to work together to develop methods that will prevent food related choking deaths of children          What makes these deaths particularly tragic is that they were completely preventable  and could have been avoided if parents were aware of the risks associated with choking on certain foods   Senator Clinton said in her letter to the two federal agencies        In her letter  the Senator noted that the two agencies had previously collaborated to warn the public about the dangers of other foods  She proposed three areas of possible collaboration that could take place in response to recent events  including public awareness campaigns  helping companies design safer products and implementing a warning system on food labels for parents  There are currently no regulations on foods that may be serious choking threats for young children        Food related choking tragedies have affected thousands of children across the country  In 2001  over 10 000 children were rushed to the emergency room after choking on food  Recently  two young children in New York City died from choking on hard candies readily available at grocery stores nationwide  They are two of over seventy children who die each year as a result of food related choking         A copy of Senator Clinton s letter to the FDA is attached  A similar letter was also sent to the CPSC         May 23  2005       Lester M  Crawford  Ph D    Acting Commissioner  Food and Drug Administration  5600 Fishers Lane  Rockville  Maryland 20857       Dear Dr  Crawford        Earlier this month  two young children in New York City died after choking on a candy product sold in stores across the United States  Their deaths were just two of the over 70 food related choking deaths of children that take place each year in our country  What makes these deaths particularly tragic is that they were completely preventable  and could have been avoided if parents were aware of the risks associated with choking on certain foods        I know that both the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and the Consumer Product Safety Commission  CSPC  are aware of this food safety issue  In 2002  your agencies successfully collaborated to warn the public about the dangers of choking on mini cup conjac gel candies  and I commend your education and recall efforts in that situation         Yet while your record of collaboration on an ad hoc basis is laudable  there is a need to establish an interagency mechanism for combating routine deaths attributable to food choking  I would encourage you to seek opportunities to bring together the expertise of the FDA s food safety officials and the CSPC s choking hazard staff  Possible areas of collaboration include             Engaging in a public awareness campaign to alert parents to the risks of food choking deaths       Working with manufacturers to design products that minimize choking hazards  and      Creating a system to develop choking warnings on food labels         Implementing an interagency response will allow both the FDA and the CSPC to more effectively respond to the threat of potentially unsafe foods  and prevent the deaths of hundreds of children in the next few years        I would appreciate any information you could provide on your efforts to address the issue of food choking hazards for children  and the plans that the FDA and CSPC might have for future collaboration  Thank you for your attention to this important issue         Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
