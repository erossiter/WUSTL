June 21  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Flash Floods in Delaware And Sullivan Counties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   The flash flooding that ravaged Colchester and washed through other parts of Delaware and Sullivan   Counties has left an entire community devastated and many families grieving  Our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and relatives of those who have lost a loved one and those who are still missing    This region has already suffered so much in recent flooding and this latest incident only adds to the difficulties and costs faced by local authorities and residents who have to rebuild their lives and their community  I am reaching out to local officials to offer assistance and am working with the Governors office and with federal agencies like FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers to see what needs to be done to help  I understand that FEMA officials will be on the ground soon to assess the damage and I will do everything I can to support the Governor and federal officials in their efforts    While we need to help the community recover and rebuild immediately  we also need to help the region with long term flood mitigation  We recently secured a  30 million authorization in the Senate to help with improvements to the Susquehanna and Upper Delaware River Watershed and I will do everything I can to ensure that the funding is made available as soon as possible
