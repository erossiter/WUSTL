February 10  2005 Clinton  President s Budget Leaves New York Schools Behind To The Tune of  1 Billion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today implored the President to rethink his cuts to education funding for New York schools  saying they would cost the state more than  1 billion  including  947 5 million under the No Child Left Behind Act  and affect the lives of more than 450 000 children          When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act several years ago  I had high hopes that we could meet our promise to New York  s and America  s children     Senator Clinton said     With this Budget  the President has broken that promise and left our schools  and our children behind             The President  s budget proposes the first cut for education in a decade  at a time when New York  s schools are struggling already to meet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act     Senator Clinton said    Coming on top of cuts to other vital programs  this may be more than New York can take           The Bush budget provides  12 billion less than was promised by No Child Left Behind nationwide and  947 5 million less for New York State   If enacted  that would mean 296 648 New York children who are eligible for Title I will be denied services         Under the budget  New York will also receive  116 5 million less in funding for after school programs than was promised  resulting in 157 157 fewer children being access these critical programs with a proven record of improving children  s lives   And  just three months after signing the IDEA Improvement Act  the President proposed under funding special education  the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act by  3 6 billion below the FY06 authorized level  This would provide just 18 6  of the national average per pupil expenditure toward meeting the excess cost of educating students with disabilities    still less than half of the 40    full funding    level that Congress committed to paying when the IDEA was first adopted 30 years ago           Under the Bush Administration  s No Child Left Behind law  school districts across the country are mandated to ensure that all teachers are highly quality and to assess every child in grades three through eight   However  the funds that the Bush Administration and the Republicans promised to help schools fulfill this mandate never materialized  Before the ink was dry  The Bush Administration proposed cutting No Child Left Behind by  90 million    Last year  despite repeated and strong attempts to add more money  funding for Title I of the act fell  7 billion short of what was promised when the Congress voted for the Act    New York schools lost  700 million and New York City schools lost  571 million in 2004 alone as a result of the Administration  s broken promise on funding for No Child Left Behind        Last year  with 9 of her colleagues  Senator Clinton introduced The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act  legislation that would provide more resources and more flexibility for schools while maintaining high standards of quality and accountability   The bill provides  50 million in additional funding for schools to improve the quality and scope of student testing      especially for students with special needs and limited English skills and  250 million to help schools that are struggling to implement the school choice provisions   The bill will be re introduced in 109th Congress in the coming weeks
