February 1  2007 Senator Clinton Questions General George Casey Jr  on His Nomination to be United States Army Chief of Staff                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Senator Clinton  Thank you Mr  Chairman and thanks to you General Casey for your years of service and thanks also to your family because they have served along with you and we  re grateful to all of you           I want to follow up on the line of questioning Senator Inhofe was perusing because I have been concerned about the readiness level of units being deployed to Iraq  And in last year  s Defense Authorization Bill  I authored an amendment that was included in the final bill that would require the Government Accountability Office to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the readiness of our ground forces within the Army and Marine Corps   no later than June 1 of this year           But even before that report is completed there have been a series of disturbing reports that our troops don  t have the equipment they need as they are being deployed to Iraq  At a January 23 House Armed Service Committee Hearing  General Schoomaker stated    We are in a dangerous  uncertain  and unpredictable time     And reiterated his concerns about the readiness levels of non deployed combat units   Five combat brigade teams are deploying to Iraq to support the proposed escalation of U S  forces there  These units are part of the pool of non deployed combat units            And General  I want to ask a series of questions that follow up on our conversation yesterday in my office because I know this is a grave concern to you and to all of us  Are you  at this point  able to assert with a one hundred percent level of confidence to this committee that every soldier being deployed to Iraq  as part of this escalation  will have all the necessary personal equipment       General Casey   Senator  that is my goal and I know that  s General Pete Schoomaker  s goal   And we work very hard to ensure that happens         Senator Clinton    Can you similarly ensure us that every soldier being deployed  as part of this escalation will receive all the necessary training for this dangerous assignment        General Casey   Again  that is the objective that both General Schoomaker and I have stated to our organizations         Senator Clinton   And finally will each and every soldier being deployed as part of this escalation have all the necessary force protection available to them to perform their mission        General Casey   And as I mention to you yesterday  I gave that guidance several weeks ago that would in fact be the case       Senator Clinton  Now  according to yesterday  s Business Week summary of a new Department of Defense Inspector General report  the Inspector General is concerned that the U S  military has failed to adequately equip soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan  especially for non traditional duties  such as training Iraqi security forces and handling detainees  The equipment shortages were attributed to basic management failures among military commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan  U S  central command lacked policies for requesting and tracking equipment requirements for units to perform their duties   General  have you seen this Inspector General  s report        General Casey    I have not Senator         Senator Clinton  Mr  Chairman  I would like to ask that the committee request a copy of the Inspector General  s report that was referred to in the Business Week story and that it be made available to the committee as soon as possible       Chairman   It will be requested and will be shared with everybody       Senator Clinton   General  as Commander of U S  forces in Iraq  were you aware of the Inspector General  s investigation       General Casey    Now this is the SIGURr  s report       Senator Clinton Yes       General Casey  I am aware of a continuing Inspector General process going on   I wasn  t aware of this specific investigation  I know they  re out there all the time doing a range of investigations       Senator Clinton  Do you know if any member of your command cooperated with this particular report       General Casey   I don  t  but I assume they do because they routinely work with the Seger  s in doing their reports       Senator Clinton   Could you report back to the committee what you find about the level of cooperation with this report  please       General Casey    I will Senator       Senator Clinton  Thank you   Are you aware of the problems that are apparently cited in this report as set forth in press counts of it        General Casey    I  m not and I  m actually a little surprised  I think you said that was equipping of transition teams and I  ve spent a lot of personal time making sure that these teams have the best equipment because they operate relatively independently and we have gone to great lengths to make sure they have the equipment and I go up and talk to each group as they come through and I  ve not heard any mention of the transition teams being short changed on equipment       Chairman   Senator Clinton  if I could just interrupt   We did receive the IG report that you referred to  apparently last night and it is now in our files   Its classified secret  so when you read it  if there are parts of it you feel should be declassified we  ll make those requests  Sorry for the interruption         Senator Clinton  No  I would appreciate that Mr  Chairman because earlier this week I questioned Admiral Fallon about an article in the Washington Post titled    Equipment for Added Troops Is Lacking  New Iraq Forces Must Make Do  Officials Say     Mr  Chairman I  d like that article to become a part of the record of this hearing as well       Chairman   It will be part of the record       Senator Clinton  And after the hearing  the Chairman and ranking member sent a letter to Secretary Gates asking about the readiness of our troops  In that article were very specific and disturbing quotes from Lt  General Speakes and others about the lack of equipment  the lack of readiness  And among the concerns were the proper levels of armor for vehicles  preposition sets issued in Kuwait are the add on armor type and do not provide adequate protection  insufficient add on armor kits for logistic trucks and prime movers  insufficient and incomplete electronic counter measure devises designed to defeat IEDs  insufficient force protection materials for the outposts we are building in Bagdad and throughout Anbar province  insufficient training sets in vehicles at home station for units to train on and preparation for deployments  And I  m very concerned that we are pursuing a policy that  regardless of what one thinks about it or how one evaluates its chances for success  certainly raises the fears that so many of our young men and women are going to be put into very dangerous situations in neighborhoods in Bagdad  dependent upon their Iraqi counterparts who may or may not be reliable           And Mr  Chairman  I believe that because of these disturbing reports of equipment shortages  we should  as we begin to debate the Warner Levin proposal  include provisions that require that adequate equipment and training be mandated so that we do not send any young American into this dangerous mission without knowing that they are as well prepared  as ready and equipped as they deserve to be to try and fulfill this mission         General Casey   I don  t think anyone feels stronger about that then I do  Senator         Senator Clinton  Thank you General                   Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
