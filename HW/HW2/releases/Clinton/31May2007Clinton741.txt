May 31  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Global Education                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  Today  President Bush recognized the importance of global education as part of our nations international development agenda  and I hope that his remarks today will lead to further commitments regarding global education at the G 8 summit next week  However  I also believe that our government can and should be doing more to improve access to a quality basic education for the 77 million children around the world who are not in school    Earlier this year  I introduced the Education for All Act of 2007 with Senator Gordon Smith  Representative Nita Lowey  and Representative Spencer Bachus  We joined together on this bill because we have the capacity  responsibility  and opportunity to help children around the world  This bipartisan legislation sets forth a framework through which we can help the United States achieve  along with its global partners  universal basic education for every child by 2015  It will help to fund teacher training  curriculum development  and increase parent and community involvement in schools  The Education for All Act will also increase our ability to help vulnerable children in states experiencing conflict or humanitarian emergencies  Through improving access to and the quality of basic education  we can reduce poverty  prevent HIV  combat malnutrition  and produce greater opportunities for women and girls    In his speech today  the President called on Congress to make our educational initiatives even more robust  and this legislation is the vehicle through which to accomplish that goal  I would urge the President  as he moves forward in advancing these issues  to partner with us  support the bipartisan Education for All Act  and help to make universal basic education a reality
