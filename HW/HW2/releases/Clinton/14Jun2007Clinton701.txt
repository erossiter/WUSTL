June 14  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Record Foreclosures                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   In response to the new data which indicates that American homeowners are experiencing a record number of foreclosures  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement     The figures which show a record number of American homeowners entering foreclosure proceedings should be a wake up call for all lawmakers and regulators   Not only have the have the number of foreclosures increased for homeowners with so called subprime mortgages  but it appears that the instability in the housing market has led to an increase in foreclosures for homeowners with prime mortgages as well        It is clear that the lax regulatory standards of the past several years led to an increase in many of these risky mortgage products which are at heart of the current foreclosure crisis  and I renew my call to Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke to review and update current mortgage lending regulations to ensure that many of these risky and unsound mortgage products and practices are curbed   Creating homeownership opportunities and ensuring access to safe and stable mortgage products are not mutually exclusive policy goals      Senator Clinton wrote Chairman Ben Bernanke last month to address abuses in the mortgage lending industry   A copy of her letter is below   The Honorable Ben S  Bernanke  Chairman  Federal Reserve Board  20th Street and Constitution Avenues  N  W   Washington  D C  20551 Dear Chairman Bernanke  Earlier this year  I wrote to you and other members of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council  FFIEC  regarding stricter regulations for subprime mortgage lending  In that letter I encouraged you and the other members of the FFIEC to take steps to make certain that Federal lending standards protect borrowers in order to ensure that lower and moderate income families continue to have access to home ownership opportunities through responsible mortgages products    In light of your recent comments that you do not expect a significant disruption to other sectors of our economy stemming from the problems in the subprime housing market  I urge you to remain vigilant in ensuring that swift action is taken to curb the abusive  deceptive and irresponsible lending practices that culminated in the current troubles we are seeing in this housing sector  Indeed  your optimistic forecast about the effect of the current housing market struggles should be encouraging  Nevertheless  it remains clear that reasonable measures that will restore stability to the entire housing market and strengthen the American people s confidence in what is oftentimes their most significant investment are still necessary    I have already proposed several steps to address the current crisis  For example  I have called for face to face financial counseling to be made available to more borrowers before they take out mortgages  and to homeowners at risk of foreclosure  Second  I proposed limiting the length of time for which prepayment penalties apply  and prohibiting prepayment penalties on mortgages with rates above a certain level    Third  I proposed strengthening the Truth in Lending Act and existing federal regulations to ensure that there is plain talk  no fine print disclosure  Too often lenders and mortgage originators are not upfront about the actual costs of a mortgage  I have also reintroduced the 21st Century Housing Act to strengthen the Federal Housing Administration s  FHA  mortgage insurance program  FHA loans should be available to more Americans  especially those who are drawn to the subprime market  as they are responsible and stable alternative  Finally  with nearly 2 million subprime adjustable rate mortgages due to reset in the next two years  I believe it is necessary to create incentives for lenders to identify worthy borrowers with troubled mortgages and to work out solutions with them to avoid foreclosure  Your perspective on what steps can be taken now to prevent a rising tide of foreclosures would be invaluable as policymakers discuss these issues going forward  Thank you for your attention to these concerns  Sincerely yours  Hillary Rodham Clinton
