May 17  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Suspension of the WHTI Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I am pleased that the Senate voted to suspend implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative for an additional 17 months   There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers and all Americans living along the U S  Canada border that the WHTI  s identification requirement would not only devastate the tourism and retail industry  but also greatly disrupts life on both sides of the U S  Canadian border
