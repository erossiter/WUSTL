January 24  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on Office of Thrift Supervision to Withdraw Proposed Changes to Community Reinvestment Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Opposes changes to vital federal program that ensures financial institutions meet the credit needs of low and moderate income communities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on the Office of Thrift Supervision  OTS  to withdraw its proposal to change the Community Reinvestment Act  CRA   the federal law that requires banks to make investments in low  and moderate  income communities  In a letter sent on Friday to Mr  James E  Gilleran  Director of OTS  Senator Clinton argued that the proposed changes would dramatically weaken the effect of the CRA and have a negative impact on economic development and access to low cost services in low and moderate income neighborhoods as well as areas affected by natural disaster across New York State          The Community Reinvestment Act ensures that banks and other financial institutions provide access to capital to everyone    from small business loans to low income mortgages  Access to financial capital for low and moderate income families is critical to the future of our communities and our economy   Senator Clinton said          I urge the OTS to re think its proposed changes to this valuable program  The social and economic cost of denying credit to moderate and low income communities could be devastating  but that is exactly what these changes would do   Senator Clinton said   This is a law with proven results  The last thing we should be doing is taking away economic opportunities from those who need them the most         The Community Reinvestment Act  passed by Congress in 1977  was enacted to encourage federally insured financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the communities they serve  especially low  and moderate  income communities  Prior to the CRA  many financial institutions failed to provide appropriate credit opportunities to all the communities they served  denying private mortgage credit and business lending to low  and moderate  income neighborhoods  Since 1977  the CRA has been critical in increasing access to homeownership and expanding access to capital  It is estimated that since the inception of the CRA  banks and thrifts have made more than  1 trillion in loan pledges to low  and moderate  income areas        Currently  the Community Reinvestment Act monitors how well banks and savings and loans are helping meet the credit needs of their communities  especially low  and moderate  income areas  Under the law  the performance of every bank and thrift in meeting these needs is regularly evaluated and rated  and this rating is available to the public  Large thrifts with more than  1 billion in assets have a CRA exam that consists of a lending test  an investment test  and a service test         In her letter  Senator Clinton argued that under the proposed changes large thrifts would have the choice of eliminating investment and service tests  thus only having to pass a lending test  This choice would likely lead to the decision by thrifts to eliminate branches in low  and moderate  income communities and ignore the needs for remittances and other low cost services        Yet another serious concern Senator Clinton pointed out was the fact that this proposal would reduce opportunities for community groups and thrifts to meet with the OTS to discuss CRA and anti predatory lending matters when thrifts merge   The minimization of community input would effectively shut out the voices of New Yorkers   Senator Clinton wrote in her letter         In May of last year  Senator Clinton joined her Senate colleagues in writing to Alan Greenspan  Chairman of the Federal Reserve  protesting the proposed changes  In October of last year Senator Clinton also wrote to Donald Powell  Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  FDIC   to voice her serious concerns regarding the proposed revisions to the CRA          A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below        The Honorable James E  Gilleran  Director  Office of Thrift Supervision  1700 G Street  N W   Washington  DC 20552       Dear Director Gilleran        I am writing to you with serious concerns over the Office of Thrift Supervision s proposal regarding the treatment of large thrifts under the of Community Reinvestment Act  CRA  evaluations        As you know  large thrifts with more than  1 billon in assets have a  three part  CRA exam that consists of a lending test  an investment test  and a service test  Under the OTS proposal  a large thrift can choose to eliminate its investment and service tests  and thus only have to pass a lending test  Or it can choose to have nominal investment and service tests  meaning that the lending test counts for most of the total grade         In New York State  thrifts with assets over  1 billion control over 84  of all thrift assets in the state  According to your proposal  these thrifts  with the great majority of the assets in the state  would be allowed to design their own CRA exams        The unacceptable risk the OTS proposal presents is that large thrifts would be permitted to neglect pressing community needs  If a thrift chooses to eliminate the investment test  it will not be required to finance affordable housing by means of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit or finance small business through equity investments or investments in New Markets Tax Credits  Likewise  a thrift could choose to eliminate the service test and not be subject to the requirement of placing or maintaining branches in low  and moderate   income communities  Similarly  with no service test  a thrift could ignore the needs for remittances and other low cost banking services  Ultimately  thrifts will likely reduce their provision of basic banking services  I fear that this situation could lead to an increase in the amount of abusive payday lending  check cashing  and other high cost services in low  and moderate income communities        I am also concerned about the proposal s treatment of rural areas and areas affected by natural disasters  Congress enacted CRA in order to stop redlining and disinvestment from low  and moderate income communities  Under the OTS proposal  large thrifts will suffer no CRA penalty if they provide community development financing to affluent communities  while avoiding low  and moderate income communities in rural areas and areas affected by natural disasters        I am particularly concerned with the impact your proposal will have on rural communities where private financial institutions are the main source of capital for domestic economic development  housing  and community revitalization  New York s upstate communities and low wealth urban neighborhoods have a deep need for investment capital  The OTS proposal virtually guarantees less capital will flow to these areas        Finally  your proposal would reduce opportunities for community groups and thrifts to meet with your agency to discuss CRA and anti predatory lending matters when thrifts merge  As you know  under current regulations  the OTS is required to hold two meetings to try to ensure that the consequences of proposed mergers are fully  fairly and thoroughly evaluated  The current proposal would allow the OTS  at its own discretion  to hold only one meeting or decline to hold a meeting at all  The minimization of community input would effectively shut out the voices of New Yorkers  whereas in fact the OTS should make every effort to ensure that local community members  voices are heard        In short  by permitting large thrifts to design watered down CRA exams  the proposal would undermine the purpose of the CRA  It would likely reduce significantly the amount of community development financing and thrift services in low  and moderate income communities and would likely allow savings and loans to serve affluent neighborhoods  and neglect low  and moderate income neighborhoods in rural areas and areas affected by natural disasters  Given the deleterious effect your proposal would have on low income communities throughout New York State  I believe it is important that OTS withdraw this proposal and give all due consideration to the comments submitted on this issue        Thank you for your attention to this matter and please contact Michael Szymanski of my staff at 202 224 4451 should you need any further information regarding my position on this issue        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
