February 9  2007 Senator Clinton Joins with Palestinian Media Watch to Release New Report on Continuing Anti Israel Bias in Palestinian Textbooks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 New Palestinian Schoolbooks Present a World Without Israel  Turn Territorial Dispute Into Religious Conflict and Reflect an Anti Western Bias Washington  DC   The new Palestinian Authority  PA  textbooks for Grade 12 encourage students to see Israel  the US and the West as enemies  and portray the PA s territorial disputes with Israel as an existential religious conflict for Islam  according to a report released yesterday by Palestinian Media Watch and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton          The report   From Nationalist Battle to Religious Conflict  New 12th Grade Palestinian Textbooks Present a World Without Israel   was written by PMW director Itamar Marcus and associate director Barbara Crook  and analyzes eight textbooks released at the end of 2006           I believe that education is one of the keys to lasting peace in the Middle East and for this reason I am very concerned with these findings  Ever since we first raised this issue some years ago there still has not been an adequate repudiation of incitement by the Palestinian Authority  It is even more disturbing that the problem appears to have gotten worse  These textbooks don t give Palestinian children an education  they give them an indoctrination   Senator Clinton said          According to the report  the new books create for students an image  both textual and visual  of a world without Israel  They reject Israel s right to exist  while describing its founding as a  catastrophe that is unprecedented in history   According to the report  the books encourage students to see themselves as victims of Israel s existence  and actively prevent these young people from seeing Israel as a neighbor to live beside in peace  The history books barely acknowledge the peace process  This is compounded by the presentation of the conflict as a religious conflict to defend Islamic land  and leaves no latitude or religious option for students to have positive    or even neutral    attitudes towards Israel           The textbooks likewise portray the US and the West in negative terms  describing the relationship as a  clash of civilizations   The books teach that the US is a human rights abuser and a violator of international humanitarian law  The texts assert that the US is an economic supporter of Israel  while completely ignoring the US aid to the PA and to Palestinian humanitarian projects                  Click here to access a copy of the report    Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Israel and the Middle East
