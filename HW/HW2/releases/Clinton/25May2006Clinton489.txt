May 25  2006 Senator Clinton Announces Legislation to Ensure Interoperable Emergency Communications Systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Today at a homeland security summit on Capitol Hill  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton unveiled legislation that will ensure that our first responders have an interoperable emergency communications system coordinated under federal leadership   Senator Clinton announced that she is introducing the legislation today to take action on this key recommendation of the 9 11 Commission  which still has not been adequately addressed almost five years after 9 11 and more than a year after the release of the 9 11 Commission  s public report                   Nearly five years after September 11  our emergency communications systems are still unprepared for the realities of a crisis   Disasters  whether manmade or natural  require close coordination and cooperation among the different federal  state and local agencies  firefighters  police officers and EMTs responding to those incidents   In the chaotic real world response  these disparate groups of people  all working toward the common goal of saving lives and protecting our communities  need to be able to communicate effectively and be on the same page   My bill will help close this gap in our preparedness and make sure that our first responders on the ground from different jurisdictions are using compatible communications technology     said Senator Clinton             Under Senator Clinton  s bill  the Federal Interoperable Communications and Safety  FICS  Act  interoperability coordination will be led by a new Undersecretary for Emergency Communications  an Interoperability Czar that will be appointed by the President  confirmed by the Senate and will report directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security   The legislation also establishes an Office of Emergency Communications that will be led by the Interoperability Czar   The bill establishes a clear mission  responsibilities and authority for this new office  which will help facilitate synergies at the federal  state and local level including information  technology and best practices sharing   Specifically  the Czar will be charged with                 Fostering the development of interoperable communications capabilities by state and local agencies             Promoting the development of standard operating procedures for the use of emergency communications during incident responses             Ensuring that the guidelines for the various federal grant programs for interoperability are consistent with the goal of nationwide and regional interoperability            Coordinating the establishment of a national response capability to deploy backup communications services in the event of an inoperable environment             Establishing basic and uniform guidelines for total interoperable emergency communications capabilities for all public safety radio and data communications systems and equipment              Establishing a nationwide  integrated public alert warning system             Reviewing and advising on Statewide and tactical interoperability plans          The Federal Interoperable Communications and Safety  FICS  Act establishes         Emergency Communications Strategy            Mandates a National Emergency Communications Strategy to set goals and timeframes for the achievement of redundant  sustainable  and interoperable emergency communications systems throughout the country and requires a national database of all frequencies and equipment used by federal agencies   The database will also include which platforms and frequencies are used by public safety agencies throughout the country so that federal responders  and responders from other localities responding to an incident can immediately know how to communicate with the first responders in that jurisdiction          Interoperable Grants Reform            Requires State and local governments to develop Statewide Interoperable Communications Plans before being able to use DHS grant funds for emergency communications   The Interoperability Czar will assess the disparate federal interoperability grants programs and ensure that there are guidelines with these grants to ensure some continuity and consistency in how these grants are dispersed   Transfers authority of the  1 billion interoperability fund to the DHS from the Commerce Department         Nationwide Assessment of Interoperable Capabilities            Requires a national assessment of the nation  s interoperability capabilities at all levels at least every five years  and during the five year period it requires continual updates and monitoring of those assessments to identify needs  gaps  and best practices            Regional Working Groups            Allows for the establishment of regional coordination working groups that involves state and local governments and the private sector so the Interoperability Czar is in constant contact and is aware of the concerns of all levels of government and the private sector    This will be a critical link between the DHS and police  firefighters  EMT  s and 911 Call Centers to ensure open communication and free exchange of ideas to promote interoperability           Emergency Preparedness Center            Creates a   federal clearinghouse    to ensure cooperation among all of the federal agencies that have an interest in moving forward on nationwide interoperability or already work with state and local governments on this issue  and will be focal point of interagency cooperation   There need to be clear lines of communication between the all of the federal agencies as well as technology and information sharing           National Alert System            Sets a 3 year deadline to create a coordinated national public alert and warning system that is interoperable with state and local warning systems
