                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Nation s Highest Military Honor is Awarded to Patchogue Native who Sacrificed his Life During Combat Mission in Afghanistan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Today  the President of the United States presented the Congressional Medal of Honor  the nations highest decoration for combat heroism  to the family of Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy during a ceremony in the White House    Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy  29 years old  was serving in Afghanistan  OPERATION Enduring Freedom during the summer of 2005  A member of the elite U S  Navy SEALs  Lieutenant Murphy was killed in action on June 28  2005 during a reconnaissance mission in support of OPERATION Red Wings  Kunar Province  Afghanistan in search of Taliban and al Qaeda insurgents  After coming under attack from a large insurgent force  Lieutenant Murphy selflessly exposed himself to enemy gunfire in an attempt to save the lives of his fellow team members who were greatly outnumbered by a determined and heavily armed enemy     The action taken that day by Lieutenant Murphy  while extraordinary in character and deed  is no less than what people had come to expect from this Patchogue native  Lieutenant Murphys acts of heroism are the personification of a SEALs duty to his country and his team  and I can think of no person who deserves this honor more today  While we can never fully repay the sacrifice that Lieutenant Murphy made that day in Afghanistan  it is my sincere hope that the Medal of Honor will forever remind people of the young man who served with honor and distinction on and off of the battlefield     Today  as their son is honored for his selfless sacrifice  I want to send my thoughts and prayers to the Murphy family  to the brave men and women of our armed forces  and to the loved ones they have left behind    At Patchogue Medford High School on Long Island  Michael P  Murphy was a National Honor Society student and a varsity football athlete  He worked as a lifeguard during his summer vacations  He attended Penn State University  majoring in political science and excelling academically     Michael decided shortly after graduating from college that he would fulfill his passion to become a Navy SEAL  He served with distinction and was posthumously awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart in recognition of his courage and sacrifice    He is survived by his mother Maureen Murphy  his father Dan Murphy  his brother John Murphy  and his fiance Heather Duggan   In 2006  Senator Clinton joined with Congressman Bishop to honor Lt  Murphy by having the U S  Post Office in Patchogue renamed as the Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy Post Office Building  The legislation was originally introduced in the House of Representatives by Bishop  where it was passed unanimously  It was then introduced by Clinton in the Senate  where it passed  and was later signed into law by the President on August 2  2006    Lieutenant Murphys four man Navy SEAL team was dropped off in a heavily forested area along steep terrain in the country s eastern mountain border with Pakistan  During the mission  the groups position was compromised  and shortly afterwards came under attack from a large insurgent force      Reports have stated that Lt  Murphy  in an attempt to establish radio contact for assistance  abandoned his secure position and exposed himself to the enemies withering gunfire  Although immediately wounded while making the call  he returned to his position and continued fighting where he saved the life of one of his fellow SEALs  Of the four man SEAL group  Murphy and two others were killed  The lone survivor was the SEAL whose life was saved by Lt  Murphy    Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy is the first recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in combat in Afghanistan in support of OPERATION Enduring Freedom and the first Congressional Medal of Honor awarded to a Sailor since the Vietnam War   There have been two other Congressional Medal of Honor recipients since the attacks of September 11  2001  both for actions in support of OPERATION Iraqi Freedom  Congress made the Medal of Honor a permanent decoration in 1863 and it is the highest honor bestowed upon American soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines  It is awarded by the President  in the name of Congress  to a person who distinguishes himself or herself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in action against an enemy of the United States  while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force  or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party  The deed performed must have been one of personal bravery or self sacrifice so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual above his or her comrades and must have involved risk of life  Incontestable proof of the performance of the service will be exacted and each recommendation for the award of this decoration will be considered on the standard of extraordinary merit
