November 17  2005 Senator Clinton Calls Upon HHS Secretary Leavitt to Ensure that Decisions Made on Vaccine Against Cervical Cancer Are Based on Science  Not Ideology                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    In light of the growing concern about the misinformation being circulated regarding the human papillomavirus  HPV  vaccine  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called upon Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt to ensure that decisions made about the vaccine are based on science not politics or ideology   Studies indicate that the HPV vaccine is virtually 100 percent effective in inoculating against cervical cancer  In the United States  approximately 14 000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year and more than 3 900 women die annually from this disease           The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  ACIP  is beginning the process of developing recommendations for the use of the HPV vaccine  Recent press reports have indicated that some groups are arguing that the vaccine may encourage sexual activity among youth    a claim that is not based on any scientific evidence and is being used to influence the outcome of ACIP  s deliberation          Senator Clinton noted that her concern about the vaccine decision making is based on the Administration  s pattern of science taking a back seat to ideology     Unfortunately  under this Administration  the Department of Health and Human Services has repeatedly allowed ideology  not science  to form the basis of policy  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was forced to remove and revise vital public health information on its website and the Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly delayed a decision on over the counter availability of emergency contraception   This unfortunate pattern has also appeared elsewhere within the Administration  and it has been well documented by the media and government watchdog groups   We do not want to see another instance of ideology trumping the health and well being of the American people   Safe and effective vaccines save lives  there is no evidence that they promote or discourage sexual activity             The text of the letter from Senator Clinton to Secretary Leavitt follows          The Honorable Michael Leavitt  Secretary  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20201         Dear Mr  Secretary          Last month  the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  ACIP  met in Atlanta to hear testimony about the human papillomavirus  HPV  vaccine which  studies indicate  would inoculate against cervical cancer with virtually 100 percent effectiveness   ACIP is charged with developing guidelines for distribution of vaccines  and you are ultimately responsible for making sure ACIP operates effectively   Unfortunately  recent press reports indicate that certain organizations are beginning to mobilize against the vaccine  arguing    without scientific evidence    that it may encourage sexual activity among youth   This is a blatant effort to influence the outcome of ACIP s deliberation          I too believe our children and the public health at large are best served when young people abstain from sex   But it would be unconscionable to withhold the HPV vaccine  which holds tremendous promise to protect against the devastating disease of cervical cancer  for political or ideological reasons   I urge you to do everything in your power to ensure that ACIP puts forth recommendations for use of this vaccine based on scientific evidence and public health concerns  not ideology            HPV is a term used to describe a group of 100 viruses  about 30 of which are sexually transmitted   Many women who are infected with HPV are asymptomatic  and may not know they have the virus  which causes cervical cancer   Over 10 000 new cases of cervical cancer occur in the United States each year  and over 3 000 women die from this disease   While deaths from cervical cancer have declined significantly since the advent of diagnostic tools like the Pap smear  the HPV vaccine holds the promise of eradicating this disease among women   In addition to cervical cancer  HPV causes penile cancer  dysplasia  and other illnesses   The HPV vaccine could also reduce the morbidity and health care costs associated with these other diseases          Unfortunately  under this Administration  the Department of Health and Human Services has repeatedly allowed ideology  not science  to form the basis of policy   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were forced to remove and revise vital public health information on the website and the Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly delayed a decision on over the counter availability of emergency contraception   This unfortunate pattern has also appeared elsewhere within the Administration  and it has been well documented by the media and government watchdog groups   I do not want to see another instance of ideology trumping the health and well being of the American people   Safe and effective vaccines save lives  there is no evidence that they promote or discourage sexual activity   Furthermore  even if HPV was no longer a threat to health  the other  very serious ramifications of unprotected sex  including pregnancy and contraction of HIV AIDS and other STDs    would still remain            I am also concerned that ACIP  s reputation may be sullied if their recommendations are seen as politically biased   ACIP is vital to our government  s efforts to promote immunization   It has played a key role in fighting disease  and most recently  in ramping up efforts to vaccinate priority populations against seasonal influenza in times of vaccine shortages  It is critical that our health care providers have confidence in the recommendations of ACIP   The loss of public faith in this important public health panel would be catastrophic          Vaccination campaigns are one of the greatest accomplishments of our public health system  leading to the virtual eradication of many infectious diseases among Americans   We have the opportunity here to continue this remarkable progress and combat a disease that affects thousands of American families each year   I urge you to ensure that ACIP is able to make its recommendations without pressure from those who would seek to inject ideology into our public health policy          Thank you for your attention to this matter           Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
