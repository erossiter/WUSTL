                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    The Long Island Congressional Delegation today announced the reintroduction of bipartisan legislation to establish a new system to preserve the environmental quality of the Long Island Sound  LIS         The Long Island Sound Stewardship Act of 2005 LISSA  was introduced into the Senate yesterday by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Charles Schumer  D NY  and Joe Lieberman  D CT   among others  The House version of the legislation was also reintroduced yesterday by Reps  Steve Israel  D NY 2nd  and Rep  Rob Simmons  R CT   Co Chairs of the Long Island Sound Caucus  with 18 co sponsors including  Reps  Gary Ackerman  D NY 5th   Tim Bishop  D NY  1st   Peter King  R NY 3rd   Nita Lowey  D NY 18th  and Rep  Carolyn McCarthy  D NY 4th         More than a decade ago  the Environmental Protection Agency identified the LIS region as vulnerable to degradation and the Long Island Sound Study was established to develop a plan for protection of the Sound   Study results released in 2002 concluded that coordinated action to save the Sound was necessary        Building on several of the study  s recommendations and on feedback from subsequent public hearings throughout Connecticut  New York  and Washington  DC  the members first introduced the Long Island Sound Stewardship Act  LISSA  last spring   LISSA would encourage protection of the LIS by providing financial incentives for owners of land parcels within the LIS area to preserve the environmental quality of and public access to this endangered habitat   The legislation passed the Senate last fall but did not pass the House  and so it must be reintroduced in the new 109th Congress            Long Island Sound is a vital resource for New York  and passing this legislation will help provide funding to protect and restore it     said Senator Clinton     I am particularly pleased that this year  s legislation will include the Peconic Bay as well as the Long Island Sound               Long Island s waterways are its lifeblood and none more so than the Sound  We ve learned the hard way too many times in the past that without cooperation and coordination in the Sound we all lose out  This bill finally gives residents on the water real financial help to encourage them to do the right thing with their land    not just for themselves  but for all of us     said Senator Schumer          Protecting the Long Island Sound should not be a Republican vs  Democrat or Connecticut vs  New York issue     said Rep  Israel     Only when we work together can we face up to the challenge of protecting the Sound for generations to come  The Long Island Sound Stewardship Act will serve as a lasting tribute to wise land use management and will mark the beginning of a new era to improve the environmental health of this important resource            Those of us who are lucky enough to live near the Sound can hardly imagine what our lives would be like if we didn t get to experience all that it has to offer   said Rep  Lowey   I am proud to have served as a co chair of the Long Island Sound Caucus  and am so pleased by the continuing work of the group   This act will help secure significant sites on the Sound so that they will serve as recreational and educational safe havens for years to come           This bill would apply new and effective conservation methods to identify  protect and enhance the Long Island Sound  noted Rep  McCarthy     This bill is a result of putting politics aside and working in a bi partisan  collaborative way to create good policy  and I  m proud to have been a part of this effort            The strong support for this bill shows a regional commitment to protecting the Long Island Sound   said Rep  Bishop   Now we need to pass this bill  and demonstrate that the Long Island Sound is not only a regional priority  it is a national treasure  I am also very pleased that the Peconic Estuary is now included in this bill  as the health of the Sound and the Estuary are intertwined         The bipartisan legislation establishes a broad based   Long Island Sound Stewardship Committee    comprised of all LIS stakeholders  including federal  state  public interest and landowners representatives   The Committee would be charged with evaluating the parcels of land within the LIS region and designating crucial parcels as   Stewardship Sites    eligible for special preservation funds          Under the legislation  the Committee would give owners of Stewardship Sites financial incentives to sell their land to preservation groups or preserve the environmental and public access features of that land themselves by volunteering to sell development rights to the land to the Committee itself   The legislation designates  40 million for the Committee  s budget  to be taken out of the funds authorized for LIS preservation under the EPA  s Nation Estuary Program           The legislation provides specific criteria for the Committee to use in designating Stewardship Sites that evaluate the contribution of the land to open space on and public access to the LIS as well as the ecological value of the land   At the urging of Senator Clinton  this year s bill includes the Peconic Bay as an area which is eligible for projects funding under the bill in addition to the Long Island Sound
