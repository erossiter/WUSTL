October 19  2005 Floor Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Support of Raising the Minimum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 As Delivered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mr  President  I find it almost hard to believe that we are here on the floor of the United States Senate arguing over the necessity for an increase in the minimum wage  I am strongly supportive of Senator Kennedy  s amendment  proud to cosponsor it  and urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote in favor of it and to oppose the second degree amendment   Now  this amendment does not go as far as I or Senator Kennedy and others would have preferred   It raises the minimum wage to  6 25 an hour  far short of the  7 25 an hour that Senator Kennedy and I and 48 other Senators proposed in March  but we could never get a vote on that  Now  this amendment  however  should have even greater support than the 50 cosponsors we had last March  It should pass unanimously out of this body  Fifty senators just last March supported an increase to  7 25 and now we have cut the increase with a hope that we can get  number one  the vote we are hoping to get on this appropriations bill  and  number two  an overwhelmingly bipartisan passage          Since March  we have seen even more evidence as to why this is critical  At a time when working families are struggling to make ends meet  it s critically important that we do something  Senator Kennedy has called this amendment a down payment on what is truly needed          Today the Federal minimum wage is  5 15 an hour  an amount that has not been increased since 1997  Now  unfortunately  the same cannot be said of the cost of living   Over the past three months  according to the federal Department of Labor  inflation has increased more rapidly in the New York metro area than any time since early in 1990  We also know that the poverty rate is going back up and that the fact is there has not been one net new private sector job created in the last 4 1 2 years                                    This chart  this should be a rebuke to all of us   It shows that we have increased the number of people living in poverty  In 2000  we had 31 6 million  which is far too many   And now we re at 37 million  up 5 4 million  Why  Because we re not creating jobs and many of the jobs that are in the economy are no longer paying wages that families can live on and can work their way out of poverty  So  Mr  President  we know that everything else has gone up  Across America  people are spending 74  more gas than they did at the beginning of 2001  Heating oil prices are expected to rise by more than 50  this winter  Such rapid price increases will force consumers  especially poor working people  to cut spending on clothing  health care  and food just so they can get to work and keep warm this winter  These rising costs and falling wages are illustrated in this chart where heating oil is going up dramatically and the buying power of the minimum wage is going down  And of course we are in the post Katrina phase  which lest we forget  demonstrated in stark terms how so many Americans live every day on the brink of economic disaster  Any setback becomes a major obstacle to being able to pay for gas   pay for food  pay for health care and prescription drugs  pay for tuition  pay for all of the necessities of life  Mr  President  I think that it s hard to stand here on the floor with this amendment before us and not wonder  when will the majority stop giving privileges to the already privileged         At what point is it too much   Never has a political party given so much to so few who needed it so little  And it never ends  You know  we re more than happy to continue to provide tax breaks for the wealthiest among us while we cut the social safety net  while we refuse to raise the minimum wage  Well  shame on us  You know  I think at some point there has to be a recognition that we are tilting the scales dramatically against average Americans   Middle class wages are stagnant  Health care costs are going up and the number of the uninsured is going up because people who work hard for a living are no longer offered insurance or cannot afford to pay what it costs  Pension and retirement security is at risk  There s something really wrong with this picture         With all due respect to those who have a different economic philosophy  rich people did not make America great  I m all for rich people  Ever since my husband got out of office and got into the private sector  I think it s great  I never knew how much the President really liked us  He can t give us enough tax cuts  I have nothing against rich people  That s part of the American dream  But with all due respect  it is not rich people who made America great  It is the vast American middle class  It is the upward mobility of people who thought they could do better than their parents         For more than 100 years we have worked hard to make sure the deck was not stacked against the average American  Teddy Roosevelt understood that if we didn t have a fair playing field  if people were permitted to monopolize capital and labor  we would have rich people  but the vast majority would never get ahead  He began to advocate for    and accomplish   a fair economic system  As we moved through the 20th century  we saw adjustments made  We saw Franklin Roosevelt who understood that sometimes the difficulties of life strike any of us and that a fair and just society would try to provide a little help so that people overwhelmed by circumstances often beyond their control could keep going and raise their children and plan for the future   And we put in a lot of government programs to make sure that we had a balance of power  a balance of power between capital and labor  between management and employees  And it worked really  really well  The history of the economic prosperity of the  American middle class in the 20th century is the greatest example of what can happen if a democracy where people  s energies are freed so that they can compete between themselves  but within a framework of rules  I m proud of the progress we made in the 20th century and I  m particularly proud that in the last eight years of the 20th century 22 million people were lifted out of poverty  Where we raised the minimum wage   Where we said to people  you have to work  but if you work we ll make sure you have a fair chance  you and your children   We  ve reversed that progress and it appears as though people are just sleep walking through this chamber and the one on the other side of the Capitol  Don t we see what is happening before our eyes    We are undermining the American dream  We are making it nearly impossible for people to believe that tomorrow will be better than today and yesterday was          These numbers sort of speak for themselves  Look at this  the minimum wage no longer even lifts a family out of poverty  You can go to work 40 hours a week   You can clean the rooms and the toilets in a motel  You can serve the food in a restaurant  You can work in a small factory  You can make that minimum wage and you cannot even get your family out of poverty  What kind of message does that send  The whole idea of America is if you work hard and you play by the rules  you will be successful  You will have a chance to do better         Look at that chart  It speaks for itself   we ve been on a steady slow decline  Even when we were able to get a bipartisan agreement to raise it in 1997  we still didn t get above the poverty line  What message are we sending to millions of hard working Americans  I represent a lot of them working hard for a living  You see them on bicycles in Manhattan delivering food  You see them doing all the hard work of janitorial services at night  In upstate New York  I see them as they get up every day and go to work and believe that they are doing what they should do   What message are we sending them  Too bad  keep working  Don t expect anything for us  we re too busy giving tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans  Well  that s a choice that is going to be made by this chamber  As far as I can tell it s going to be a choice to vote against the minimum wage and to vote instead for the second degree amendment which is designed not only to defeat Senator Kennedy  s amendment  but to do even more harm to the paychecks of working Americans  I mean  this is what I don t understand  The second degree amendment would deny more than ten million workers the money wage  overtime and equal pay rights by ending individual fair labor standards coverage and raising the threshold for which a business would be held accountable to  1 million from  500 000          In short  and let s make no mistake about this  the second degree amendment would be the end of the 40 hour workweek  So  we can go right back to the end of the 19th century because that s where we re heading  You know  there are those who  bless their hearts  believe that America was better off at the end of the 19th century  when you were told what to do and you had to do it and you didn t have much of a choice about it  I just don t agree with that  I m proud of the progress we made in the 20th century  but I  m just absolutely convinced that some people are trying to head us right back there  Because if it s the end of  the 40 hour workweek and the end of the American weekend because there s no rules on overtime that means a pay cut of  3 000 a year for the median income earner and an  800 pay cut for those earning minimum wage          Employees are already free to offer more flexible schedules under current law  but today if they come in and they tell an employee    Guess what  I need you this weekend  You are going to have to work     they have to offer overtime when the work is more than 40 hours a week  The second degree amendment would undermine that basic protection  So  instead of making it easier for families to spend time together  we basically are going to tell workers that they have to do whatever they are told at the risk of losing their job without any overtime pay or any other compensation         The second degree amendment would also prohibit states from providing stronger wage protections than the federal standard for employees like waiters and waitresses who rely on tips  The amendment removes agency direction and creates a safe haven for violators of consumer protections by prohibiting agencies from assessing fines for most first time reporting violations and preempts states   abilities to enforce these laws  In many states  we happen to think some of those rules need to be enforced  Just like what James Madison said in the Federalist    If men were angels  there would be no need for a government     But we aren t and we never will be  not on this earth         The job of government is to level the playing field  help right that balance because otherwise people are powerless to defend themselves especially when they have to get up every day and go to work to keep body and soul together and to put food on the table and particularly if they are a single parent trying to make due on minimum wage  So  it s disheartening  We could have had an up or down vote on the minimum wage  If you want to vote against it  vote against it  but to introduce a second degree amendment loaded with poison pills against workers and fairness  that speaks louder than anything I could say in this chamber          I think there s going to be a day of reckoning  You can t continue to tilt the scales against the vast majority of the Americans and not be held accountable in the political process  The mask has been ripped off of compassionate conservatism and people see it for what it is  partisan politics to favor the privileged  If that s what we re fighting against in this chamber  then I guess  bring it on because most are on the same side  They want to make sure the deck is not stacked against them  that they ve got a fair chance to compete and that their labor gets a fair return          So  Mr  President  I hope that our colleagues will rally in support of Senator Kennedy  s amendment and vote against the second degree amendment  We should pass an increase in the minimum wage and it should not come at the cost of denying basic rights to millions of Americans and turning the clock back to the 19th century  which is what it would do  Thank you
