February 21  2007 Senator Clinton Calls for Armed Services Hearing to Look Into Reported Problems at Department of Defense Medical Facilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The Honorable Carl Levin  Chairman      Committee on Armed Services     SR   228       United States Senate     Washington  D C  20510      Dear Mr  Chairman       I write to you with great concern regarding the quality of outpatient support and assistance received by wounded servicemen and women at Department of Defense medical facilities   Media reports published this weekend regarding Walter Reed Army Medical Center indicate that the quality of care and assistance our servicemen and women receive  as well as the facilities in which they live  are disturbingly poor   In light of these reports   as well as your strong record in support of our men and women in uniform   I request that you consider holding hearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee to learn more about this unacceptable problem            As I have long said  our nation has a duty to honor and support those who have served and sacrificed so much in the defense of our nation   Yet these recent news reports indicate that more than five years after 9 11 current efforts are coming up far short   Problems cited included an insufficient number of case managers and patient advocates to oversee outpatients  poor training for those case managers and for platoon sergeants also charged with overseeing wounded servicemembers  an insufficient number of Spanish speaking caseworkers to support patients for whom English is not their first language  inadequate orientation and guidance for family members of wounded servicemembers  and major flaws in the systems used to track medical records and other important paperwork          Each of these issues needs to be addressed as expeditiously as possible   An Armed Services Committee hearing to learn more about the problems faced by outpatients at Walter Reed and other Department of Defense medical facilities would be a good first step in correcting these unacceptable conditions              Our men and women in uniform are the best that our nation has to offer   Those who have sacrificed so much in the service of our nation deserve our deepest appreciation  respect and support   Thank you for your consideration and for your continued strong support of the men and women serving our nation   I look forward to continuing to work with you in support of all our service members and their families          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton      CC   The Honorable John McCain
