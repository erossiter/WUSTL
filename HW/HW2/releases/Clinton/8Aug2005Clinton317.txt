                                                                                                                                                                                                                        200 million coming to New York as part of a major national initiative to combine broadband technology with affordable housing for communities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Bronx  NY     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined with Former Treasury Secretary Robert E  Rubin  the Local Initiatives Support Corporation  LISC  and its subsidiary the National Equity Fund  NEF  to announce a partnership with One Economy to announce and launch   access home     a  1 billion initiative that will develop more than 15 000 affordable homes with high speed digital Internet connectivity and provide low income families personal access to computers and technology services across New York and the country  The initiative  which was launched at La Puerta de Vitalidad in the Bronx  expects to connect nearly 100 000 people to the vast advantage of the Internet  Approximately  200 million of the  1 billion access home package will be invested across New York State          Access Home will develop over 15 000 affordable rental homes and apartments in communities across the country  including 3 000 units in New York State  over the next five years  Residents in each of these properties will have high speed digital access and a package of Internet related services from One Economy  including computer purchase vouchers  computer training for residents  and a community specific   Beehive     a website sponsored by One Economy that provides information about personal finance  health  schools  jobs  childcare  and other services              Today  one of the greatest catalysts for fostering economic opportunity and opening up new markets is the Internet  but for too many people  especially those in rural and underserved communities  the digital divide is still too wide  All New Yorkers   from the Bronx to Buffalo and beyond   need to be wired with next generation broadband technology in order to succeed in the global marketplace     said Senator Clinton    With access Home  LISC NEF and One Economy will help bring the power of technology into thousands of households so that every family can have the tools for success in today  s technology rich economy              Senator Clinton has worked closely with One Economy and LISC in their efforts to provide underserved communities with the technological tools they need to grow and compete in the global economy  In March  Senator Clinton announced the first access home project at North Creek in Warren County  Senator Clinton has long championed projects that bring the information superhighway to more remote regions of the state  which is ultimately essential to the economic viability of the region  Numerous communities throughout the state need greater access to broadband and Senator Clinton will continue to work with these partners to expand this initiative beyond throughout Upstate New York          The  1 billion financing package for access Home includes both low income housing tax credit  LIHTC  investments from NEF and grants and loans from LISC   Investors who have already made commitments to access Home include Fannie Mae  Citigroup  Washington Mutual  KeyBank  and Deutsche Bank            Americans today live and work as members of the global economy    and technology is our connective tissue     noted Robert E  Rubin  chairman of LISC    The launch of access Home can play a key role in ensuring that our low income communities and neighbors are able to participate in this technological revolution            The digital divide still runs deep in America  leaving far too many families out of the personal and economic opportunities technology provides     stated Michael Rubinger  president and CEO of LISC    At the same time  a dearth of well maintained affordable housing severely compromises the strength of families and neighborhoods  For these reasons  LISC NEF looks for innovative ways to stabilize communities while providing them the tools they need to compete in the 21st century               The quintessential American Dream remains strong today  but the means with which we reach it have changed     said Rey Ramsey  president and CEO of One Economy    Instead of the traditional encyclopedia or classroom  the vehicles for advancement are a computer and high speed digital Internet access  With help from our friends and allies in the housing  financial  and technology fields  access Home will help low income Americans turn their dreams into reality             Despite an overall increase in the number of U S  households with computers and or Internet access  low income Americans remain significantly less likely to be online than middle  or high income households  In fact  Americans earning less than  30 000 a year comprise only 18 percent of Internet users  despite comprising 28 percent of the population  Low income youth are especially hard hit  children in families earning less than  15 000 a year are eight times less likely to use computers at home as children in families earning  75 000 or more           The US Department of Commerce estimates that 95  of new jobs created will require significant computer skills   According to projections from the US Labor Department  eight of the ten fastest growing jobs in the period 2000 2010 are computer related  Unfamiliarity with technology can actually bar people from the doors of their would be workplaces  of the 92  of Fortune 500 companies that used corporate websites for active job recruitment in 2003  one third did not give job seekers the option of applying for jobs offline          About LISC  Local Initiatives Support Corporation  LISC  is dedicated to helping resident led organizations transform distressed neighborhoods
