April 12  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Federal Trade Commission Report on Entertainment Marketing to Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Today s report from the Federal Trade Commission shows that we are making progress toward enforcing video game ratings and giving parents the information they need to make informed decisions for their children   I have been a strong advocate of raising awareness of video game ratings and have worked with the industry and major retailers to make sure they are enforced   According to today s report  87 percent of parents are aware of the industry s video game rating system and more than seven in ten use these ratings when their child wants to play a video game for the first time  The FTC also found that video game retailers have made strides in limiting sales of M rated games to children          The FTC report shows  however  that there is still work to be done   Many parents want the ratings system to provide more information about games and we need to continue to be vigilant about making sure ratings are enforced and I hope the industry will consider the FTC s recommendations   We also need to do everything we can to help parents and policymakers keep up with electronic media that is constantly changing   I have introduced and championed the Children and Media Research Advancement  CAMRA  Act to study the impact of electronic media on children s cognitive  social  emotional  and physical development   I will work with my colleagues to get this bill to the President s desk this Congress
