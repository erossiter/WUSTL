August 9  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Need to Expand Stem Cell Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Today Marks Fifth Anniversary of Bush Ban on Federal Funding for Research on Additional Stem Cell Lines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC      Five years ago today  President Bush struck a blow to science by placing severe restrictions on federal funding that would allow American scientists to conduct promising stem cell research   By limiting scientists to using already existing stem cell lines  President Bush put up a barrier to scientific advancement that he raised even higher last month when he used his first and only veto to block expansion of this research   With this veto  he turned his back on overwhelming support in both Houses of Congress on both sides of the aisle and dashed the hopes of millions of Americans with debilitating diseases  injuries and other conditions that could be helped by discoveries from stem cell research   America should be leading the world in innovation  ingenuity and new ideas  not ceding our scientific leadership to ideology   We must continue to stand up for those with diseases and conditions that could be helped by this research and I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to expand this promising research
