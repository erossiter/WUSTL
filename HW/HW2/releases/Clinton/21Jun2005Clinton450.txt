                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Calls on the Senate to Support Funding for Corporation  for Public Broadcasting and the Ready to Learn program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today sent a letter to Senator Arlen Specter  R PA   Chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor  HHS and Education  urging him to support funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Ready to Learn program  This letter was initiated after the U S  House s action to cut children s programs  like Sesame Street  Clifford the Big Red Dog and Dragon Tales  by one hundred million dollars  a twenty five percent cut from last year s funding  The Senator released the letter at a press conference with Rep  Ed Markey and familiar characters from Public Broadcasting like Clifford the Big Red Dog  Arthur  Maya and Miguel  Leona the Lion to call on Congress to roll back these cuts        The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is a major source of funding for high quality children s programming  In her letter  Senator Clinton speaks about these devastating cuts   At a time when so many parents complain about the negative messages our media sends to children  it is perplexing that members of Congress would eliminate one of the only programs that provides educational content through the media          In addition to Senator Clinton  twenty five other Senators signed onto this letter  including Senators Daniel Akaka  HI   Max Baucus  MT   Joseph Biden  DE   Jeff Bingaman  NM   Barbara Boxer  CA   Jon Corzine  NJ   Mark Dayton  MN   Christopher Dodd  CT   Byron Dorgan  ND   Tim Johnson  SD   John Kerry  MA   Mary Landrieu  LA   Patrick Leahy  VT   Carl Levin  MI   Joseph Lieberman  CT   Blanche Lincoln  AR   Barbara Mikulski  MD   Barack Obama  IL   Mark Pryor  AR   Jack Reed  RI   John Rockefeller  WV   Ken Salazar  CO   Charles Schumer  NY   Debbie Stabenow  MI   Ron Wyden  OR          Please see attached letter        Senator Specter  Chairman  Subcommittee on Labor  HHS  and Education  Washington  D C  20510        Cc   Senator Harkin   Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Labor  HHS  and Education  Washington  D C  20510       June 21  2005       Dear Senator Specter        We write to urge you to support funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Ready to Learn program  which support high quality children s programming such as Sesame Street  Dragon Tales  and Clifford the Big Red Dog         On Wednesday  the House Appropriations Committee cut the Corporation s budget by 25 percent from  400 million to  300 million  The bill also eliminated the  23 million allocation for the Ready to Learn program  the  39 million fund to allow PBS stations to convert to digital programming  and the  50 million meant to upgrade satellite technology that is essential to PBS  operations        At a time when so many parents complain about the negative messages our media sends to children  it is perplexing that members of Congress would eliminate one of the only programs that provides educational content through the media  I hope that you reject this approach and instead provide a vitally needed increase in funding for these programs        Many parents are struggling to find positive shows for their children to watch among the violent and lurid programming that dominates television  We know from the National Television Violence Study  the largest content analysis undertaken to date  that nearly 2 out of 3 television programs contain violence    and children watching television are exposed to an average of 6 violent acts per hour  In fact  violence is more prevalent in children s programming than in other programming  And the amount of television violence is on the rise         As parents are increasingly anxious about the negative messages their children receive from the media  these television programs represent the only safe harbor for many parents  Shows like Sesame Street and Dragon Tales  which receive essential support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting  have been helping children learn critical thinking and social skills for decades  These shows are a fun  engaging and valuable part of millions of children s daily lives  Parents feel confident exposing their children to these shows because they are safe  free of violence  and designed to stimulate children s rapidly developing brains        We know that children spend an enormous amount of time watching television  According to research recently released by the Kaiser Family Foundation  children between the ages of 0 to 6 spend an average of two hours a day watching television or videos  and children between the ages of 8 and 18 spend 3 hours watching television  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Ready to Learn make some of the healthiest and most valuable programming available to our children  I sincerely hope that you will do all you can to strengthen these critical programs         Thank you in advance for your consideration of this important issue        Yours truly
