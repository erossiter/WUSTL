November 15  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Agreement Between UAW and Ford to Begin Production of New SUV in 2008 at Ford Stamping Plant in Buffalo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This is wonderful news for the local UAW  Ford  and the City of Buffalo  The agreement not only highlights the key role the Ford Stamping Plant will play in the production of the new Flex SUV when production begins in 2008  but it also underscores the importance of this facility and of the hardworking UAW members to the Buffalo economy  This is a win for all parties involved  and is yet another example of labor and management coming together to showcase the potential of Western New York  I applaud the UAW and Ford for working to yield positive results for New Yorks auto industry and its workers
