December 19  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Iraq Funding Votes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  Last night  the Senate voted to add additional funding for Iraq to the Omnibus appropriations bill without any requirements to end the war   As I have said before  I cannot and will not support continuing to fund a flawed and failed strategy in Iraq   I was proud to be a co sponsor of an amendment offered by Senators Russ Feingold and Harry Reid that would require the President to safely redeploy U S  troops from Iraq within nine months after which funding for military operations in Iraq would be terminated   Unfortunately  the Senate rejected Senator Feingold s amendment and instead voted to support funding for the Iraq war without any further limitations    Yesterday  the Administration released its quarterly report on Measuring Stability and Security in Iraq which only reconfirmed the fact that the Iraqis have not engaged in the political reconciliation that the President s escalation or surge was supposed to promote   Rather than continue with a flawed and failing policy in Iraq  it is time to change course   Therefore  I cannot support the addition of appropriations for Iraq to the supplemental appropriations bill      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
