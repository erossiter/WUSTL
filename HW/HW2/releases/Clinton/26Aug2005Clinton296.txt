August 26  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on Colleagues to Reverse Planned Cuts to Medicaid Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC    In anticipation of Congress   return next month  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with a number of her colleagues in calling for a reversal of plans by the White House and Congressional Republicans to slash Medicaid funding  In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee  the Senators warned of a profound impact on the ability of Medicaid to serve as a health care safety net            Slashing Medicaid funding will do nothing to address Medicaid  s challenges   It will undermine the program and increase the burden on our states  local governments and health care providers when we should be working together to strengthen the program     said Senator Clinton     It is unconscionable to balance the budget on the backs of our most vulnerable Americans and that is exactly what the White House and Congressional Republicans have decided to do               It is indefensible to use calls for reform as a cover to further undermine Medicaid   We need to start with a commitment to strengthen Medicaid and uphold our commitment to preserve the health care safety net for our most vulnerable Americans   This commission is cause for serious concern              For months  Senator Clinton has been fighting proposed cuts to Medicaid  calling them a prescription for disaster for states  local governments  health care providers and those who depend on the program as their only means of health care coverage   The budget agreement will cut Medicaid funding by  10 billion  cutting funding to New York by  1 37 billion over the next five years          Earlier this year   Senator Clinton joined forces with Senators Smith and Bingaman to win approval in the Senate budget resolution of a bipartisan commission to recommend how to improve service delivery and quality in the Medicaid program in a way that is cost effective   This bipartisan commission was removed from the final budget deal in favor of a presidentially appointed commission to recommend changes to Medicaid          The Republican Medicaid cuts will have a profound effect on the delivery of health care in New York  forcing untenable choices about who can keep coverage and who can qualify for benefits in the future  New York s Medicaid program provides insurance to 4 1 million New Yorkers  including 1 7 million children  1 4 million adults and 1 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries   Medicaid is truly the last resort for these children  seniors  disabled Americans and New Yorkers living with AIDS and other chronic diseases           The Medicaid cuts will hit rural areas particularly hard   Nearly one in four residents of rural areas is uninsured  compared to less than one in five of those living in urban areas   Nearly 16 percent of people who live in rural areas have Medicaid coverage    compared with about 10 percent of people in urban areas  Medicaid covers more than one in four children in rural areas  27 percent of children in rural areas are enrolled in Medicaid  compared with less than 19 percent of children in urban areas            A copy of the Senators   letter is attached          August 25  2005       Senator Charles Grassley  Chairman  Finance Committee  219 Dirksen Senate Offices Building   Washington  DC 20510      Senator Max Baucus  Ranking Member  Finance Committee  219 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510      Dear Chairman and Ranking Member         We are writing to express our concern about efforts underway in the Finance Committee to comply with instructions in the FY 2006 Budget Resolution calling for  10 billion in cuts to programs within the committee  s jurisdiction  Recent reports indicate that the bulk of those cuts will come from the Medical program  We realize the Finance Committee faces a difficult task in complying with these cuts  As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of the creation of the Medical program  however  we urge you not to make changes to Medicaid that could undermine the program  s critical role as our nation  s health care safety net            As you know  Medicaid provides health care services to more than 58 million of our most economically vulnerable citizens  including children  people with disabilities  expectant mothers  and the elderly  In recent years  Medicaid has attracted attention because its impact on both state and federal budgets increased  leading many to claim that Medical costs were   out of control     In reality  however  Medicaid costs have grown more slowly than costs in either Medicaid or the private health insurance market  Indeed  one recent study showed that between 2000 and 2003  the average growth rate for Medicaid costs was approximately 7 percent per enrollee  compared to 12 6 percent in the employer sponsored insurance market           Instead  Medicaid costs have increased largely as a result of growth in Medicaid rolls  As a counter cyclical program  Medicaid played a critical role in the recent economic downturn  providing health care to an additional 3 million people who  absent the Medicaid program  would have otherwise become uninsured           In recent weeks  a number of proposals for changing the Medicaid program have emerged that would profoundly impact the ability of Medicaid to serve as a health care safety net  For example  several organization have suggested that Congress can realize budget savings by requiring Medicaid participants to shift additional costs to beneficiaries  either by charging increasingly higher co payments for Medicaid services  or requiring month premiums for enrollment in the Medicaid program           While solutions such as these may make sense for higher income populations  individuals served by the Medicaid program may be adversely affected  Even premiums that seem modest on their face can lead to deep declines in Medicaid enrollment  For example  research on Oregon  s Health Plan Standard  OHP  program  a limited benefits package for eligible adults above the traditional Medicaid income threshold  found that 44 percent of beneficiaries lost coverage after minimal cost sharing was instituted  In total  50 000 people dropped coverage  If similar cost sharing arrangements are allowed in the traditional Medicaid program  where enrollees hover at or near the poverty line and already struggle each month to cover food  rent and utility costs  we would likely see a similarly dramatic decrease in enrollment  Millions of individuals would lose access to essential health care services           In addition  it is important to evaluate fully any changes to Medicaid that would allow more   flexibility    in program rules  While flexibility can be useful administrative tool  it should be balanced with the needs of beneficiaries  Medicaid should offer a full range of core health care services to beneficiaries including access to hospitals  physicians  meaningful drug coverage  and appropriate ancillary services  We are concerned that flexible standards and benefits package between populations could adversely affect beneficiaries with disabilities  children and others           Transforming Medicaid while trying to decrease expenditures is a great challenge   Several options  including reforming the way Medicaid pays for prescription drug   could help achieve necessary reductions while keeping our commitment to those in need  Regardless of the reforms necessary to achieve savings in the Reconciliation measure  beneficiaries and their access to necessary services should be paramount  If we may be of any service to you as this process moves forward  please do not hesitate to contact us            Sincerely        TOM HARKIN  United States
