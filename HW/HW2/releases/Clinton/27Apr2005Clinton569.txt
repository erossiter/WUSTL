                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Senator joins prominent Democrats to unveil plan to address serious racial and ethnic health disparities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Continuing her campaign against the disparities in healthcare coverage and treatment among different racial and ethnic groups in New York and across America  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined a group of prominent Democrats in unveiling a plan aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare  At the same time  she decried the Bush Administration  s planned cuts to Medicaid as contrary to efforts to help America  s ethnic and minority populations access the healthcare they need        The Democratic plan    Closing the Health Care Divide     includes a set of principles designed to address racial and ethnic health disparities by        Expanding the health care safety net        Diversifying the health care workforce        Combating diseases that   disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minorities        Emphasizing prevention and behavioral health        Promoting the collection and dissemination of data and enhancing medical research        Providing interpreters and translation services in the delivery of health care          America has the most advanced medical system in the world  but the best system in the world doesn  t do you any good if you can  t afford to get the treatment that is available  or you cannot access the system     Senator Clinton said    Instead of working to close the divide  we have been faced with an Administration that seems intent on widening it             It is an absolute travesty that while we are announcing our plans to eliminate the disparities in healthcare  the President and the Republican leaders in Congress want to drastically slash Medicaid     Senator Clinton said     Instead of slashing needed programs  we need to make investments in minority health programs that improve health and save lives           While unveiling the Democrats   plan  Senator Clinton called for investments in data collection on the diseases that disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities   diseases like asthma  which affect 25  of the children in central Harlem   more than twice the rate of the national average   The Senator also called for investments in disease prevention  using culturally appropriate messages and a diverse public health workforce  and called for increased investments in translators who can help to guide patients through the healthcare system   More than 150 languages are now spoken in New York  yet only 3 2  of physicians are African American and only 2 5  are Hispanic        Finally  the Senator called for increased access to quality care for all communities by expanding health care coverage and reducing the number of uninsured Americans        According to a recent study by former U S  Surgeon General David Satcher  an estimated 83 750 deaths could be prevented each year if the United States eliminated the black white mortality gap  According to a Kaiser Family Foundation Report  57  of African American women age 45 64 are diagnosed with hypertension    twice the rate of white women the same age   More than one third of Hispanic women are uninsured  37      again  over twice the rate of white women  16     Native American populations are twice as likely to develop diabetes than the general population  while over one third of Asian American women do not receive routine screening for cervical cancer  And in New York  blacks are almost twice as likely as whites to have low birth weight infants        Senator Clinton has a long history as a champion on health disparity issues  During her time as First Lady  the Clinton Administration announced an initiative to eliminate health disparities by 2010  which were then incorporated into the Healthy People 2010 goals   The ideas from this initiative are still carried out in programs such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  s Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health  REACH  2010 grant program  and the Minority AIDS Initiative within the Department of Health and Human Services  Since her election to the Senate  Senator Clinton has introduced legislation addressing minority health and health disparities  including the Healthcare Equality and Accountability Act of 2003 with fellow Senate Democrats and an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2005 Senate Budget Resolution which created a reserve fund of financing through which the government could increase its commitment to eliminating minority health disparities  This amendment passed the Senate by unanimous consent        The plan was unveiled today at a press conference which included Senator Clinton  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid  House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus  the Congressional Black Caucus  the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Native American Caucus  The principles outlined by Democrats today are the first step towards drafting bicameral legislation to address racial and ethnic health disparities and ensure that every community  regardless of race or ethnicity receives appropriate and affordable health care         A copy of the principles is attached       CLOSING THE HEALTH CARE DIVIDE  Principles for Addressing Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities    Democrats are committed to eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care because everyone deserves equal treatment in health care   The elimination of racial and ethnic health disparities can and should be a priority for our nation   The health of every community is enhanced when we work to promote health care equality for everyone  regardless of race or ethnicity   Legislation to address racial and ethnic health disparities should do the following       Expand the Health Care Safety Net   Lack of health insurance and access to health services results in significant declines in health status within racial and ethnic minority communities   The availability  quality  and affordability of health coverage options that provide meaningful access to health care services must be expanded in order to successfully address racial and ethnic health disparities         Diversify the Health Care Workforce   Our public health workforce should reflect  understand  and respect the backgrounds  experiences  and perspectives of the people it serves   Efforts should be made to recruit  train and retain health care professionals from underrepresented groups   In addition  the training of health professionals should be expanded in order to produce a culturally and linguistically proficient health care workforce       Combat Diseases That Disproportionately Affect Racial and Ethnic Minorities   Many diseases and conditions  such as diabetes  obesity  heart disease  asthma  and HIV AIDS  disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities    Federal research and prevention initiatives should seek to reduce the disproportionate burden of certain illnesses among racial and ethnic minorities        Emphasize Prevention and Behavioral Health   Estimates suggest that as much as fifty percent of health care costs are caused by behaviorally related illnesses  including heart disease  high blood pressure  obesity  and substance abuse   Cultural and social factors can contribute to the behavioral patterns underlying these illnesses   Behavioral interventions have the potential to prevent such illnesses and save billions of dollars in health care costs       Promote the Collection and Dissemination of Data and Enhance Medical Research   In order to fully understand the scope of health care disparities  it is necessary to have data on individuals   health care access and utilization that includes race  ethnicity  primary language  and socio economic status    This information is necessary in order to measure the existence of  causes  and effects of health care disparities and to lead to solutions        Provide Interpreters and Translation Services in the Delivery of Health Care  Almost 11 million people in the United States speak English   not well    or   not at all     More than 21 million speak English less than   very well     We need to ensure that the quality of and access to health care received by people with limited English proficiency is not sacrificed because of language barriers  Interpreters and translated materials are key to providing effective health care and reducing health disparities among these populations
