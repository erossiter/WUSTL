                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Local Bronx community development organizations to face cutback in federal funding if Budget cuts not reversed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is urging her Senate colleagues to restore funding to a federal program for small businesses and entrepreneurs which was slashed by the Bush Administration  The Small Business Administration s Program for Investments in Microentrepreneurs  PRIME   which provides training and technical assistance to low income entrepreneurs  received no funding at all in the President s  06 Federal Budget  Senator Clinton is fighting to have funds restored in the Senate Appropriations process        Last year  the PRIME program provided over  1 5 million to a number of organizations and non profits across New York that help with training and technical assistance for local microenterprises   New York s smallest businesses  If the cuts are not reversed  the Women s Housing and Economic Development Corporation  WHEDCO  in the Bronx stands to lose its federal support under this program  WHEDCO is dedicated to the economic advancement of low income women  men and children  through the creation of beautiful environments and a uniquely integrated program of education  social services  job creation  housing  and job training and placement  The Business Outreach Center Network  BOC   which has offices in the Bronx and across New York City  would also stand to lose its funding under this program  The Business Outreach Center  BOC  Network is a micro enterprise small business development organization with over a decade long record of delivering customized business services to under served entrepreneurs in New York City as well as capacity building services to organizations establishing and operating community and micro enterprise development programs        As part of her efforts to have the funding restored  Senator Clinton wrote to the Chairman and Ranking Members of the Senate Appropriations Sub Committee on Commerce  Justice  and Science  urging them to restore funding for PRIME in the Fiscal Year 2006 Commerce Justice Science Appropriations bill  In her letter  the Senator called on the subcommittee on Commerce Justice Science to provide  5 million for the PRIME program  the same amount that the program was funded in 2005          Given the critical importance of small businesses to our nation s economic infrastructure  I believe that investing in the PRIME program is investing in American jobs  standard of living improvements  and a sound economy   Senator Clinton said   With small businesses as the number one job creator in America  we have a duty to nurture and support them          New York is blessed with people who have the skills  drive and talent to start their own businesses  but they need technical assistance and training to make it happen   Senator Clinton said   I will fight in the Senate to ensure that Americans and American small businesses get the funding they need  We cannot allow the president to disregard a program that is vital to the strength of the American economy         PRIME provides funding for training programs and technical assistance to low  and very low income small businesses and entrepreneurs  This program has benefited thousands of entrepreneurs across the state of New York by providing the entrepreneurs with the greatest need  the assistance they require in order to succeed  Last year  microenterprises accounted for nearly 20  of all employment in New York State         The Honorable Richard Shelby  Chairman  Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice  and Science  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  S 146A   Washington  D C  20510        The Honorable Barbara A  Mikulski  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice  and Science  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  SD 144  Washington  D C  20510       Dear Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Mikulski        As the Subcommittee begins the consideration of appropriations requests  I am requesting your support for the Small Business Administration Program for Investments in Microentrepreneurs  PRIME   The PRIME program is the only federal microenterprise program that provides intensive training and technical assistance to low and very low  income entrepreneurs  In my home state of New York  and other communities throughout the country  PRIME has benefited thousands of low income entrepreneurs by providing the assistance they need in the most critical and tenuous stage of any small business  the first months         For many entrepreneurs  one of the most significant barriers to starting or growing a successful small business is the lack of training and technical assistance in areas such as financial literacy  marketing  bookkeeping  and customer service  For low income entrepreneurs who typically require the greatest amount of committed service and guidance  the PRIME program provides access to the critical training and expertise necessary to succeed         While there are many challenges facing the Appropriations Committee this year  I believe that the modest funding set aside for the PRIME Program continues to be a sound investment  By investing in the smallest of the small businesses  PRIME succeeds in creating jobs and income in communities that need it most  Moreover  PRIME grantee organizations have been successful in maximizing their limited PRIME funds to leverage other state  local and private dollars  multiplying the investment in overlooked and underserved communities of need         Your leadership is greatly needed to ensure that this important program remains a priority as the Commerce Justice Science Appropriations bill moves forward  I am requesting that the subcommittee fund this critical program at last year s level of  5 million  Indeed  every dollar committed to the PRIME Program is a dollar committed to fueling the upward mobility of low and very low income entrepreneurs in their pursuit of the American Dream         Thank you for your attention to this matter        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
