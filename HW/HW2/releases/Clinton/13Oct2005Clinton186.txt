October 13  2005 Statement by Senator Clinton on the Draft GAO Report on Plan B                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today released the following statement on the draft GAO report on the Food and Drug Administration  s  FDA  decision making process on the Plan B application   Senator Clinton joined with Senate colleagues to request the GAO investigation after the FDA took the highly unusual step of rejecting an application to make Plan B emergency contraception available without a prescription after its own scientific advisory committee overwhelmingly voted in favor of the product being made available over the counter            The draft GAO report appears to confirm what we have suspected for some time  science was compromised in the FDA  s decision making process on Plan B   It is essential that the FDA be the gold standard in drug approval and science must come before politics or ideology   As the FDA considers another application to give Plan B over the counter status  this investigation is more critical than ever and I look forward to the release of the final report
