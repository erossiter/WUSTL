                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Schumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York State Economy and National Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the joint House and Senate Conference Committee approved  16 5 million in the FY06 Defense Department Appropriations bill for projects to benefit the Capital Region   The House has approved the bill   The Senate is expected to work on the Defense Appropriations bill this week   If the bill is passed  it will be sent to the President for his signature        Projects to be funded under the bill include  3 million for the Arsenal Support Program Initiative at Watervliet Aresenal   2 million for the Advanced Technology Lightweight Armament System Rarefaction Wave Gun  ATLAS Raven  by Benet Labs   1 million for the Joint Manufacturing Technology Center at Benet Labs   2 million for the Smart Machine Platform Initiative by Benet Labs and Techsolve   2 million for Plug Power  s Fuel Cell Development for Continuous Operation of Government project   3 5 million for High Temperature Superconductor  HTS  Generators for Navy All Electric Ships by Superpower   1 8 million for the Functionally Reactive Surfaces Technology Program at Starfire  and  1 2 million for SUNY Albany Center of Excellence for Nanotechnology Secure Advanced Fabrication Facility for Electronics  SAFFE   National Secure Foundry  Initiative       This is great news for the Capitol Region   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Capitol Region and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Capitol Region defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge           The Capital Region has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology     Senator Clinton said    This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support            3 million in federal funds is slated for Arsenal Support Program Initiative ASPI programs at Watervliet Arsenal   The purpose of the ASPI is to help maintain the viability of Army manufacturing arsenals and the unique capabilities of these arsenals in supporting the national security interests of the United States  ASPI funds are used by the arsenal to market its unused space   and its potential   to private contractors  The Watervliet Arsenal has used this funding in the past to make significant improvements to the buildings and roads at the site   This has been key to attracting at least fourteen new companies and dozens of new jobs to the site         2 million in federal funds will go to Benet Labs for the ATLAS Raven project  This system supports the goal of developing an ultra lightweight combat vehicle that will significantly enhance the ability of all services to rapidly deploy to trouble spots worldwide  The ATLAS system will provide the enabling technologies for unprecedented reductions  50   in the weight of large caliber high muzzle energy cannons  These weight reductions in the gun system will in turn bring the vehicle weight well under the 14 ton limit required for air transportability  Benet Labs is located within the Watervliet Arsenal        In addition   1 million in federal funds will go to Benet Laboratories   The funding will be dedicated specifically for accelerating the development and implementation of advanced materials  technologies  and designs for Department of Defense  DoD  legacy and emerging weapon systems   The Joint Manufacturing Technology Center  JMTC  fulfills a critical national demand for an interdisciplinary approach to unite academic research and industrial know how to solve complex problems in advanced materials development and manufacturing technology        Also   2 million in federal funds will go to Benet Weapons Lab and Tech Solve Smart Machine Platform Initiative   For the Army  the DoD and the US industrial sector  it is critical that components can be fabricated domestically both for development and production needs in a timely and affordable manner   Though capable of operating more quickly and more precisely than that of earlier generations  the productivity of today  s machine tools is still bound by the same inability to extend beyond basic execution of instructions   The next generation of machinery must not only execute instructions  they must also possess complex internal sensing and control systems to create instructions and integrate them  in real time  into manufacturing processes   The Smart Machine Platform Initiative is designed to develop these systems and TechSolve  s Ohio Team partnering with Benet Weapons Lab will work to this end           2 million in federal funds will go to Plug Power to support efforts to develop fuel cells for Continuity of Government  DOD is required to have an effective Defense Continuity Program  DCP  to ensure mission critical functions continue despite any potential enemy threats or attacks  Continuous run  distributed power in disperse locations  is a significant component of any DCP  This program will develop and optimize fuel cell systems for these DCP applications  and begin demonstration and evaluation in distributed sites  culminating in an extensive report evaluating fuel cell ability to meet Defense Continuity requirements  Such a demonstration will help to illustrate the vital role that fuel cells can play in providing distributed power generation and reliable back up power in the event of terrorist attacks  natural disasters  or grid failure  Plug Power is a founding member of New Energy New York    3 5 million in federal funds will go to Superpower for the HTS Generators for Navy All Electric Ships  The Navy has made a decision to implement electric drive on its next class of surface combat ships  and to examine the use of all electric power systems in other ships and submarines  The all electronic design will enable electric warships to quickly divert a ship s propulsion power for use by state of the art electrical weapons and advanced long range sensors  Second generation high temperature super conducting wire has the potential to revolutionize this and a variety of other military applications where high power density  as well as reduced size and weight  at reasonable cost is absolutely essential  Although dramatically smaller and lighter than conventional generators  HTS generators can produce an equivalent amount of electrical power  The reduced size of HTS generators is of particular relevance to the All Electric ship because it allows increased flexibility in ship architecture  enhanced power density  and transient response  improving overall ship performance and survivability  Superpower is a founding member of New Energy New York    1 8 in federal funds will go to Starfire Systems  Inc   Functionally Reactive Surfaces Technology Program   The 2006 program will demonstrate a textile patch hybrid circuit that will support the integration and control of diverse technologies such as temperature sensors  chemical sensors  active features for physical comfort and a textile based rechargeable battery  all integrated into a fire protective textile garment for both soldiers and domestic first responders  The patch and the associated array of fabric sensors are required to field an intelligent uniform that will monitor both the health of the soldier and the threats in the environment  Chemical  Biological  Nuclear  etc     The limiting factors that prevent this capability today are the lack of miniaturized wearable electronic components  actuators  sensors  communication  and microcontrollers  which are also prime objectives of the Future Force Warrior  FFW  vision  The individual sensor  integral power  and active fabric technologies all need to be integrated  monitored wirelessly  and be intelligently controlled by an electronic circuit using minimal power   The goal of this project is to demonstrate an ultra microminiaturized hybrid circuit and packaging technology that will enable this integration and combination of multiple sensors and control logic into a robust silicon carbide board based package the size of a postage stamp            1 2 million in federal funds will go to SUNY Albany Center of Excellence for Nanotechnology Secure Advanced Fabrication Facility for Electronics  SAFFE   National Secure Foundry  Initiative  The project is a timely concept for the creation of a fully integrated  300mm wafer  nanoelectronics R facility to serve as a unique platform for formulation and demonstration of nanotechnology innovations for national defense applications   SAEFF is designed to provide strategic support to critical national defense and security needs through the establishment of a secure  ready and responsive R   foundry    for the successful development of 32nm nanoscale computer chip technology and beyond   As such  SAEFF leverages combined resources from industry  government  and university to create a most effective consortium for enacting the U S  nanoelectronics defense industry technology roadmap
