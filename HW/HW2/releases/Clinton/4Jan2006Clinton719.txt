                                                                                                                                                                                                                        National report shows marketing of some  educational  media products may be misleading parents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   New York  NY   Senator Clinton is calling for Senate hearings into the marketing and advertising of educational media products   such as DVDs and video games   for children  citing a recent report which shows that companies often make unproven claims about the effectiveness of their products          In a letter to Senator Enzi  Chair of the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  Senator Clinton said she shares the concerns raised by the report and calls for a hearing on this issue to better understand the impact of such media products on children and how to better inform parents about them            Educational media products are a multi million dollar industry because parents want to make sure they are getting the best possible tools to entertain their children and help them learn     said Senator Clinton   We owe it to parents to help them discern between products that will really help their children learn and those that may in fact have the opposite effect                A Teacher in the Living Room      http   www kff org entmedia upload 7427 pdf  the newly released report by Kaiser Family Foundation  found that the only real resources parents have to make decisions about the quality and efficacy of these products are their own personal experiences  recommendations from others and product advertising   While detailed guidelines have been issued by the Federal Trade Commission about the labeling of products  such as down pillows  household furniture and cashmere  media products that purport to have educational value for children are not held to any special standards  While the report points out that many of the unique properties of media can make learning more fun and more effective and that many child development advocates believe the qualities inherent in some media have tremendous potential as learning tools  there is serious potential for misleading claims to be made about the educational value of certain products  The report also raised concerns that more research needs to be done to understand the impact of educational media products on very young children          A copy Senator Clinton  s letter to Chairman Enzi follows               The Honorable Michael Enzi  Chairman           Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  428 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  D C   20510         Dear Chairman Enzi          As you may know  the Kaiser Family Foundation recently released a report entitled   A Teacher in the Living Room   revealing that the marketing efforts of media products created for use by young children are often misleading   The report found that in the marketing of the vast majority of these products  baby videos and games  companies make educational claims such as  will increase your baby s brain capacity  and  transforms television into an educational experience  in spite of the fact that there is no outcome based  scientific research to support such claims                     As you can imagine  these advertisements are very enticing to parents who want their babies to develop into healthy  smart children  but the Kaiser report makes it clear that parents may be being deceived   The report also says that very young children  those under two  may suffer a learning deficit if they are exposed to such products                      Because of your commitment to protecting children and empowering parents  I am writing in the hope that you will conduct a hearing into this issue early in 2006   I think a hearing would be a wonderful opportunity to delve into what we do and do not know about the effects of media on our children  and to help parents get the most accurate information possible enabling them to make the right decisions for their families                        The market for these items is large and growing rapidly   In 2004 alone  the children s DVD and video industry was estimated at  4 8 billion and projected to increase over the next five years   The market for videos aimed specifically at infants and toddlers was estimated at  100 million in 2004 and  according to a quote from an industry insider interviewed for the Kaiser report  the  overall video market for infants and pre schoolers has become much more crowded over the past several years due to the influx of licensed character videos and products without educational value  from companies  eager to cash in on the baby video market   p13                     The report also points out that in contrast to the detailed guidelines that have been issued by the Federal Trade Commission about the  labeling of products such as household furniture  dietary supplements  cashmere  and down pillows   media products that purport to have educational value for children are not held to any special standards   And  as the report points out  this is not for lack of available metrics of cognitive achievement for children            As you know  the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no screen time for babies under two    and no more than an hour a day for older children    because the early years of a child s life are critical to their development   Lack of human interaction may actually impede a child s brain growth  and companies like those cited in the report that claim otherwise are not being forthcoming with consumers            I hope you will agree that a hearing is needed into this important matter   I look forward to working with you in the New Year on this and other vital issues affecting children and families                     Sincerely yours                           Hillary Rodham Clinton
