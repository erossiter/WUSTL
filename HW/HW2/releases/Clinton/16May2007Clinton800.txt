May 16  2007 Clinton  Lowey Back Westchester Call for Nuclear Regulatory Commission to Redirect Entergy Fine for Emergency Planning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Clinton and Lowey Support Request by Westchester County to Allocate Fine on Entergy for Radiological Emergency Planning in Counties Near Indian Point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congresswoman Nita M  Lowey today backed a call by Westchester County to have the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  redirect the siren fine levied against Entergy Nuclear Northeast for emergency planning in the areas surrounding Indian Point   In a letter to Regional Administrator Samuel J  Collins  Clinton and Lowey expressed support for the county s request that the fine be directed towards the four counties responsible for maintaining radiological emergency preparedness plans for the Indian Point Energy Center           Using the Entergy fine to improve emergency preparedness at the county level makes sense  and I urge the NRC to approve Westchester County s request   Senator Clinton said   The funds from this fine would greatly assist the areas surrounding Indian Point to improve their emergency preparedness plans and help ensure the safety of local residents  I fully support Westchester County s request to redirect the entire NRC fine on Entergy for the four counties affected by the delayed Indian Point siren project            The cost of preparing for an emergency at Indian Point is a huge burden to the surrounding counties   Representative Lowey said    As long as Entergy continues to incur fines for problems with sirens at Indian Point  it makes sense to redirect those funds to the counties so they can be used to prepare for and protect local residents in case of an emergency           In July of 2005 Senator Clinton authored legislation included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requiring backup power for Indian Point s emergency notification system and complete installation of new emergency notification sirens in the areas around Indian Point  In February 2006 the NRC issued an order to implement the Senator s legislation  In January  Entergy was granted an extension until April 15  2007   That deadline was not met and the NRC assessed a  130 000 fine on Entergy           Congresswoman Lowey has repeatedly called for an Independent Safety Assessment of the Indian Point facility given its history of operational and safety mishaps   She has also introduced legislation requiring that any nuclear facility seeking a license renewal meet the same operational and safety standards a new facility would be forced to meet today   Under Lowey s bill  Indian Point would not be able to complete re licensing until the new siren system is fully operational          Earlier this week  the Commissioner of the Department of Emergencies Services for Westchester Country wrote to the NRC requesting that the sum from the fine be used for emergency preparedness spending in the areas impacted by Indian Point s failed siren system           A copy of the Clinton Lowey letter is below            May 16  2007      Mr  Samuel J  Collins  Regional Administrator  United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Region 1  475 Allendale Road  King Of Prussia  Pennsylvania 19406      Dear Mr  Collins       We write to you today to express our support for Westchester County s request that the entire Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  siren fine assessed to Entergy be directed toward emergency planning in the four counties tasked with maintaining radiological emergency preparedness plans for the Indian Point Energy Center          As you know  Indian Point has experienced multiple safety and security deficiencies  including repeated failures of emergency sirens and leaks of contaminated water from spent fuel pools   Entergy s failure to meet its April deadline to have an operational siren system in place is unacceptable  and we appreciate the enforcement action taken by the NRC   The NRC now has an opportunity to further enhance safety around the plants             We urge the NRC to direct to the four counties in which the siren system is located the funds from this fine to improve emergency preparedness            Thank you for your attention to this matter   We look forward to your prompt action and response          Sincerely     Hillary Rodham Clinton  Nita M  Lowey           Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Indian Point
