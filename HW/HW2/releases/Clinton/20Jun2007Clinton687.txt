June 20  2007 Statement of Hillary Clinton on Veto of Stem Cell Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Today  the President vetoed a bill passed by Congress to support stem cell research  This is the second time that President Bush has turned his back on overwhelming bipartisan support in both Houses of Congress and maintained this senseless barrier to scientific advancement  Now  this is research that holds such promise for devastating diseases  Yesterday  I met with a group of children suffering from juvenile diabetes  I co chair the Alzheimer s caucus in the Senate  I ve worked on helping to boost funding for research to look for cures and a way to prevent so many devastating diseases  And we know that stem cell research holds the key to our understanding more about what we can do  The Bush Administration policy is holding science back and holding our nation back in the race to new medical treatments and discoveries   As an original cosponsor of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  I believe that America should be leading the world in innovation  ingenuity and new ideas  Todays veto is just one example of how the President puts ideology before science  politics before the needs of our families  We must continue to stand up for those with diseases and conditions that could be helped by this research and I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to expand this promising research
