July 25  2006 Senators Schumer  Clinton and Queens Congressional Representatives Call on FEMA to Step in and Help After Queens Power Outage Disaster                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Members of Congress call on President Bush  Governor Pataki and FEMA to help Queens residents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    U S  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton and U S  Representatives Joe Crowley  Carolyn Maloney and Nydia Velazquez today called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to step in and help the thousands of Queens residents who have been without power for more than a week           In a letter to FEMA Director David R  Paulison  the Members of Congress said they were encouraging Governor Pataki to make a disaster declaration for the area in order to expedite state and federal assistance  and called on FEMA to determine whether there is an appropriate federal role for the agency in assisting residents impacted by the blackouts  They also asked whether the President may exercise his authority to issue an Emergency Declaration for the impacted areas   In the event that a Major Disaster Declaration is made  they called on the Federal Government to make grants and low interest loans available under the Stafford Act to impacted individuals and businesses            With thousands of New Yorkers literally left in the dark for days on end  the federal government should step up to the plate and provide Queens residents and businesses with the assistance necessary to get back on their feet     said Senator Schumer             We must ensure that the state and federal governments are taking the appropriate action to respond to this disaster  which has impacted thousands of people and hundreds of small businesses throughout Queens     Senator Clinton said     I have been following this situation closely and I believe that if state and federal assistance is needed  then we must ensure it is available since people and businesses are suffering as each day passes   The people of Queens deserve answers from Con Ed as to why this happened and what is being done to prevent it from happening again               Immediate federal aid must be given to northwestern Queens residents and businesses that have been punished by the power outage crisis for a prolonged period at once   This situation calls for urgent action on the federal government s part to step in help offset the spiraling costs and mitigate the conditions of this disaster on Queens businesses and residents     said Rep  Joe Crowley            The blackout has been an unmitigated disaster and the federal government needs to declare it as such   It  s really the worst of both worlds for western Queens residents  the neighborhood produces most of the city  s power  yet the area  s electrical grid appears to be one of our least reliable    FEMA must take action now     said Rep  Carolyn Maloney            Last week I called on the Small Business Administration to provide assistance to area businesses    now we are asking FEMA to do its part   It is crucial that the affected communities receive assistance in rebounding from this crippling power outage     said Rep  Nydia M  Vel    zquez           A copy of the letter is attached          July 25  2006        The Honorable David R  Paulison  Undersecretary for Federal Emergency Management  Director Federal Emergency Management Agency  United States Department of Homeland Security  500 C Street  S W   Washington  D C  20472    Dear Director Paulison     We write concerning a situation that continues to worsen as time passes   We know firsthand that power outages have occurred in Queens  New York especially in Astoria  Sunnyside  Woodside  Long Island City  and Hunters Point as well as reports of outages in other areas   Thousands of individuals  and an estimated 750 small businesses  have been impacted and we are concerned about the long term impact this could have on these heavily populated areas   Costs are anticipated to exceed several million dollars           To date  the Governor has not made a declaration as a result of this incident   Nonetheless  under the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act  42 U S C  5121        the President may exercise any authority vested in him by     the Stafford Act  with respect to an emergency when he determines that an emergency exists for which the primary responsibility for response rests with the United States                  While we are encouraging the Governor to make such a declaration in order to expedite state and federal assistance  we ask that FEMA determine whether there is an appropriate federal role and whether the President may exercise his authority to issue an Emergency Declaration for the impacted areas   Further  in the event the damage assessments warrant a Major Disaster Declaration  we hope that grants and low interest loans available under the Stafford Act will be made available to the impacted individuals and businesses           As the summer continues to put considerable pressure upon the power grids  we are concerned that this is only the beginning of critical situations like this   To that end  we ask that FEMA be prepared to provide assistance in the event the current situation worsens               Our fellow citizens and small business owners have been suffering greatly and we want to make sure we are doing everything possible to provide much needed relief in the coming days   We must also ensure minimal disruption to key infrastructure should this power outage worsen   We ask that you please respond to our inquiry about the potential for a Presidential Emergency or Major Disaster declaration as well as FEMA  s preparatory actions in the event that there are additional risks of loss of life  property  and business           We appreciate your attention to this important matter and ask that you consult with the Governor of New York to determine the next appropriate steps for the federal government   If you need additional information please do not hesitate to contact any of us about the current situation           Sincerely     Hillary Rodham Clinton     Charles E  Schumer    Joseph Crowley              Carolyn Maloney    Nydia M  Velazquez    Cc     The Honorable George Pataki  Governor of New York    The Honorable Michael Bloomberg  Mayor of New York City
