                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Low Cost trucking network to help small farmers distribute produce to Rochester and beyond                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Newark  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined with representatives from Foodlink  along with local Wayne County growers and producers to showcase a new  low cost distribution network that will help small local farmers    including those in Wayne County   ship their produce to markets in Rochester and beyond  The   Farm to Fork Fulfillment Center    partnership was established to help small farmers in the Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes regions  who might not otherwise have access to long haul distribution networks  sell their produce beyond their local area  in upstate markets like Rochester or New York City         Foodlink Foodbank currently distributes over 8 million pounds of rescued food to 10 counties in the Greater Rochester and Finger Lakes region  Once those deliveries are completed however  their trucks often return to Rochester empty  Through the   Farm to Fork Fulfillment Center    partnership  those trucks will now be available to local growers and farmers wishing to send their produce to purchasers from restaurants  schools and other markets in Rochester and elsewhere  After delivering their food to area non profits  Foodlink will pick up locally grown produce in its 10 county service area   Once the product is at the Foodlink warehouse  the product can either by combined with other growers for a larger delivery to New York City  or can be delivered directly to regional retailers for sale to local consumers        The Farm to Fork Fulfillment Center has already begun working with area farmers including Finger Lakes Organic in Wayne County  Freshlink Farms in Monroe County  Pederson Farms and Red Jacket Orchards in Ontario County  One grower    Pederson Farms   has already reached an agreement with Foodlink to ship over half million pounds of cauliflower from Ontario County to Wegmans Stores in Rochester and to other wholesalers  The Fulfillment Center is working additional partners on both the supply side of product and the demand side for consumers who desire fresh New York State products          Some of the biggest challenges to staying economically viable that farmers cite are the lack of local markets and the poor distribution system for their farm products   it is simply too hard or impossible for them to bring their goods to market     Senator Clinton said    This is an incredible initiative that will not only help small local farmers expand their markets  but will provide consumers with the high quality  specialty foods they demand and the nutritious produce that they deserve     Senator Clinton said           It is not good stewardship to put together millions of dollars worth of assets to just do charity     asserts Foodlink  s Executive Director Tom Ferraro    As the regional food bank for 30 years  we have been combating the symptoms of hunger  while an opportunity exists to use our existing infrastructure to impact the systemic causes of poverty by supporting Upstate economic development  job creation  and ensuring New York State dollars stay in our communities           In addition to providing the distribution network through their fleet of trucks  Foodlink will also help participating growers by serving as an ordering and central distribution point with their food warehousing infrastructure  a USDA certified repackaging facility and a computerized inventory system         An initial focus group held by Foodlink in March 2005 found that area school districts and food purchasers  despite their commitment to supporting local producers  experienced considerable difficulty in buying locally grown  New York State produce  Among the identified barriers was the lack of time that food purchasers have to personally connect with multiple farmers to locate the product they need and the desire for a central source point for quality  fresh  home grown produce  Conversely  smaller regional farmers were experiencing difficulties in getting their quality product to suppliers because of their own limitations  including lack of available staff  difficulties with transportation and the challenge of delivery schedules that conflict with the demands of the land        Through her   Farm to Fork    initiative  Senator Clinton has been an avid promoter of New York State  s agriculture and has been working hard with New York State growers  distributors  retailers  restaurateurs  and others to expand markets for New York  s diverse array of agricultural products  particularly in downstate regions such as New York City    As the regional food bank  Foodlink delivers donated food products to over 550 human service agencies in a 10 county area   Recognizing the very real connection and distribution needs of New York  s smaller local farmers  Senator Clinton  s office connected with Foodlink several months ago to work on creating an alternate system that would not only help meet the needs of local producers and purchasers but would potentially open markets in New York City and beyond        Farmers and growers who are interested in the Farm to Fork Fulfillment Center should contact        FOODLINK  936 Exchange Street
