March 28  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Pentagon Announcement Regarding Guard Reserve Healthcare                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    The Pentagon has taken a step in the right direction by providing our National Guard members and Reservists with improved health care benefits  but further action is still necessary  While the Pentagon s decision to extend TRICARE  military healthcare benefits  for up to eight years for active duty Guard and Reserve members and their families is an improvement  TRICARE should be available to all reserve component members regardless of their activation status         That s why Senator Lindsey Graham and I have introduced the Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005 to ensure that all members of the National Guard and Reserves    both activated and non activated    and their families have access to TRICARE  Guard members and Reservists would only be required to pay monthly premiums  which should provide some relief for self employed personnel  who pay large sums for health coverage or have none at all  Also  our legislation does not place a time limit on how long a Guard member or reservist is eligible for TRICARE        Members of the National Guard and Reserves  in New York and elsewhere  are making incredible sacrifices as they serve their country with courage and distinction  Allowing access to TRICARE shows that we care and honor the service national guard and reserve members valiantly give our nation  Providing the U S  National Guard and Reserves  as well as their families  with adequate health care is the least a grateful nation can do
