June 29  2006 Key Senate Panel Approves Major Clinton Initiatives to Support Older Americans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Clinton amendments included in Older Americans Act Reauthorization      Amendments will help seniors access critical healthcare and mental health services while remaining in their own communities                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed approval by the Senate Health  Education Labor and Pensions Committee of S  3570  the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006  to reauthorize the Older Americans Act  As passed  this legislation includes three key Clinton provisions to assist seniors with their healthcare and mental health needs and brings increased emphasis to home and community based delivery of critical services  Originally enacted in 1965  the Older Americans Act is the major vehicle for the delivery of social and nutrition services to seniors   New York receives the third largest allocation of Older Americans Act funds  just behind California and Florida             In less than ten years  the first wave of Baby Boomers will turn 65   We must consider how we will meet the increasing needs of this elder boom and the growing demands placed on our local  state  and federal health and social service systems in the years ahead     Senator Clinton said    We must ensure that we are prepared to meet the needs of our growing senior population and one issue we must address is the long term care crisis in our country resulting from the growing longevity of Americans             As the number of individuals in need of long term care services rises  issues such as financing  quality of care  family involvement  quality of life  end of life care  and overall service delivery are growing in importance and impact  And although Medicaid now allows the provision of some home and community based services and supports without federal permission  the program still lags behind  even when many seniors would be able to  and most times would prefer to  stay in their own homes  According to the AARP  more than 90 percent of older adults prefer to remain in their current residence as long as possible            As we anticipate an increase in demand for long term care services from the Baby Boom generation  Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities or NORCs provide a critical and commonsense approach that recognizes the importance of community for positive and healthy aging  and of partnerships between the public and private sectors for offering a range of services  from social and health programs to educational  recreational and volunteer opportunities  that are diverse  flexible  and designed to engage as many community residents as possible     Senator Clinton said          Specifically  the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee incorporated three of Senator Clinton  s initiatives in the Older Americans Act reauthorization  including          1  Key components of The Community Based Choices for Older Americans Act  which Senator Clinton introduced this April  to assist older Americans who are just above the Medicaid threshold to obtain supportive long term care services and supports necessary to remain safely in their communities   This legislation and the   Choices for Independence Demonstration Projects    included in the Older Americans Act would provide seniors with the option  in collaboration with a service coordinator  to choose long term care services and supplies  such as a wheel chair ramp  assistance with grocery shopping or cooking  or adult day care services  based on their preferences and needs   One of the key concepts from Senator Clinton  s legislation that has been included in this grant program is targeting individuals at greatest risk for spending down to Medicaid   This approach not only respects the wishes of older adults  but also reduces the financial burden on Medicaid and local taxpayers   This grant program builds on activities already underway at the Administration on Aging  AoA           2  Senator Clinton  s proposal to establish a national grant program to support Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities  NORCs  and make a concept pioneered in New York a permanent part of the national strategy for helping older adults age with dignity   Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities  NORCs  are defined geographic areas not originally built for seniors but that over time become home to a large concentration of older people  such as a neighborhood or apartment complex   As incorporated into the Older Americans Act  Senator Clinton  s proposal would provide state grants for the development of model aging in place projects for older individuals  with a preference given to NORC programs  According to the AARP  as many as 25 to 36 percent of seniors live in NORCs  There are over 40 officially recognized NORC SSPs operating across New York State  including programs in Albany  Bronx  Queens  Brooklyn  Manhattan  Plainview  Rochester  Syosset and Troy          3  Key components of the Positive Aging Act  a bill that Senators Clinton and Collins reintroduced last year to address the gap in mental health services for older Americans  The   Multidisciplinary Health Services in Communities    program would provide competitive grants to states for developing and operating systems that deliver mental health screening and treatment services to older individuals who lack access to these services  These grants would also be used for programs to increase public awareness about the benefits of prevention and treatment of mental disorders in older individuals and to reduce stigma and age related discrimination associated with these disorders  Older adults have the highest rates of suicide in the nation and depression is the foremost risk factor  Senator Clinton  s grant program is a way to help the nearly 20 percent of older Americans who experience mental health problems  such as depression or anxiety            We face an important yet exciting challenge as we prepare our country for the aging boom   What we are doing to prepare for this challenge through reauthorization of the Older Americans Act today will have a tremendous impact on our systems of care tomorrow     Senator Clinton said     I am grateful to my colleagues for their commitment to this process and for their support of the new initiatives on long term care  NORCs and the Positive Aging Act that I have worked with my colleagues to include in this bill
