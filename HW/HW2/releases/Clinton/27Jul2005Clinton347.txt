                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she had joined a bi partisan group of her Senate Colleagues in urging President Bush to immediately release the remaining  47 6 million in emergency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  funding in the Fiscal Year 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act   The Senator and her colleagues wrote a letter to the President this week in response to the high energy costs facing low income households and the heat wave plaguing the Northeast and Midwest            In a heat wave like this  air conditioning can literally be a matter of life and death     Senator Clinton said     We need to make sure that New York s low income seniors are not forced to choose between staying cool and safe and emptying their bank accounts  We will keep the heat on the President until he releases these emergency cooling assistance funds           As the Senators noted in their letter    Many low income consumers entered this summer facing high energy debt due to the winter  s unaffordable energy prices and cold weather   The heat wave that affected the Northeast and Midwest states in June  and the current heat wave affecting the nation  is adding to these households   energy burdens  especially low income seniors  as they must run air conditioning to remain cool and safe           The first official week of summer brought a heat wave with temperatures climbing into the 90s across states in the Northeast   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  New York State had its warmest June on record and according to the New York Independent System Operator  NYISO   for the second consecutive week  extreme heat and humidity have driven statewide electricity usage to record levels         A full text of the letter is attached        July 25  2005       The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Ave   NW  Washington  DC 20500     Dear Mr  President         We urge you to immediately release the remaining  47 6 million in emergency Low Income Home Energy Assistance program  LIHEAP  funding provided in the fiscal year 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act   The high energy costs facing low income households and the heat wave experienced throughout the Northeast and Midwest warrants the release of these funds         The first official week of summer brought a heat wave with temperatures climbing into the 90s across states in the Northeast and Midwest   In Michigan  Wisconsin and Vermont  the National Weather Service said June was the second hottest on record in the state   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration    New York State had its warmest June on record  with 12 other states from Minnesota to Maine ranking much above normal for the month      Temperatures reaching above 90 degrees in Cleveland prompted city officials to test a new system to warn seniors to keep cool   An automated telephone system dialed the homes of more than 57 000 residents 65 and older  who are especially susceptible to the heat   In Boston  temperatures at the end of June reached a high of 95 degrees    the hottest the city has been since August 18  2002   For July  cooling degree days for the region remained significantly higher than normal         Many low income consumers entered this summer facing high energy debt due to the winter  s unaffordable energy prices and cold weather   The heat wave that affected the Northeast and Midwest states in June  and the current heat wave affecting the nation  is adding to these households   energy burdens  especially low income seniors  as they must run air conditioning to remain cool and safe  For example  on Tuesday  July 19th  ISO New England recorded the highest electricity usage in New England history         We believe the cooling crisis facing low income Americans warrants the immediate release of emergency LIHEAP assistance   Thank you for your attention to this important request        Sincerely      Debbie Stabenow  Jack Reed  Tom Harkin  Patrick J  Leahy  Joseph R  Biden  Barack Obama  Lincoln Chafee  Jon S
