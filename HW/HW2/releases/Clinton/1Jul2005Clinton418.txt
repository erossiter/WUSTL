July 1  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Retirement of United States Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O Connor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I would like to thank Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O Connor for her twenty four years of distinguished service to our nation and to our system of jurisprudence  While history will remember her most notably for being the first woman to serve on our nation s highest court  her legacy is that of a moderate voice of reason  Justice O Connor was a guardian for the rule of law who put fairness and justice before ideology        In 1981  when President Reagan was faced with a vacancy on the Supreme Court  he selected Justice O Connor  a consensus conservative nominee who became one the Court s most respected members  The vacancy created by Justice O Connor s retirement presents President Bush with a challenge and an opportunity to put partisanship aside and to honor the Constitution s mandate that he seek the advice and consent of the Senate in naming a replacement  I urge the President to take seriously the Constitution  s charge and to engage the U S  Senate    both Republicans and Democrats    in a process of genuine consultation in order to identify and to ultimately confirm a consensus nominee
