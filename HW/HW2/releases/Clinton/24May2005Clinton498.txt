

Urging the Government of the Republic of Albania to ensure that the parliamentary elections to be held on July 3  2005  are conducted in accordance with international standards for free and fair elections           IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  May 17  2005  Mr  BROWNBACK  for himself and Mrs  CLINTON  submitted the following concurrent resolution  which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations ________________________________________         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION  Urging the Government of the Republic of Albania to ensure that the parliamentary elections to be held on July 3  2005  are conducted in accordance with international standards for free and fair elections        Whereas the United States maintains strong and friendly relations with the Republic of Albania and appreciates the ongoing support of the people of Albania         Whereas the President of Albania has called for elections to Albania s parliament  known as the People s Assembly  to be held on July 3  2005  Whereas Albania is one of 55 participating States in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  OSCE   all of which have adopted the 1990 Copenhagen Document containing specific commitments relating to the conduct of elections         Whereas these commitments  which encourage transparency  balance  and impartiality in an election process  have become the standard by which observers determine whether elections have been conducted freely and fairly         Whereas  though improvements over time have been noted  the five multiparty parliamentary elections held in Albania between 1991 and 2001  as well as elections for local offices held between and after those years  fell short of the standards in the Copenhagen Document to varying degrees  according to OSCE and other observers  Whereas with OSCE and other international assistance  the Government of Albania has improved the country s electoral and legal framework and enhanced the capacity to conduct free and fair elections         Whereas subsequent to the calling of elections  Albania s political parties have accepted a code of conduct regarding their campaign activities  undertaking to act in accordance with the law  to refrain from inciting violence or hatred in the election campaign  and to be transparent in disclosing campaign funding  and        Whereas meeting the standards in the Copenhagen Document for free and fair elections is absolutely essential to Albania s desired integration into European and Euro Atlantic institutions  including full membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   as well as to Albania s progress in addressing official corruption and combatting organized crime  Now  therefore  be it   Resolved by the Senate  the House of Representatives concurring   That Congress     1  welcomes the opportunity for the Republic of Albania to demonstrate its willingness and preparedness to take the next steps in European and Euro Atlantic integration by holding parliamentary elections on July 3  2005  that meet the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe  OSCE  standards for free and fair elections as defined in the 1990 Copenhagen Document    2  firmly believes that the citizens of Albania  like all people  should be able to choose their own representatives in parliament and government in free and fair elections  and to hold these representatives accountable through elections at reasonable intervals    3  supports commitments by Albanian political parties to adhere to a basic code of conduct for campaigning and urges such parties and all election officials in Albania to adhere to laws relating to the elections  and to conduct their activities in an impartial and transparent manner  by allowing international and domestic observers to have unobstructed access to all aspects of the election process  including public campaign events  candidates  news media  voting  and post election tabulation of results and processing of election challenges and complaints    4  supports assistance by the United States to help the people of Albania establish a fully free and open democratic system  a prosperous free market economy  and the rightful place of Albania in European and Euro Atlantic institutions  including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  NATO   and   5  encourages the President to communicate to the Government of Albania  to all political parties and candidates in Albania  and to the people of Albania the high importance attached by the United States Government to this parliamentary election as a central factor in determining the future relationship between the United States and Albania
