September 14  2007 Schumer  Clinton  Hall  Engel  Lowey to VA  Keep Comprehensive Medical Services at Montrose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  U S  Representatives John Hall  D NY19   Nita Lowey  D NY18   and Eliot Engel  D NY17  joined with U S  Senators Charles Schumer  D NY  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today to urge the Department of Veterans Affairs to keep comprehensive medical services at the Montrose VA Campus and to consider local proposals for the site    James Nicholson  the departing Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  is expected to rule on a plan for the V A  Hudson Valley Health Care System  which includes the Montrose Campus  before he leaves on October 1st   Changes being considered as part of the VAs ongoing Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  process involve potentially moving the domiciliary services currently provided at the Montrose site to the facility in Castle Point    As you review the options for the Montrose campus  we want to strongly emphasize our desire to see it remain dedicated to serving the needs of local veterans  the New York legislators wrote in a letter to Nicholson   We are therefore strongly urging that your final decision ensure the provision of comprehensive medical services at the Montrose VA site    The lawmakers expressed concern that a study used by the V A  to determine the future of Montrose does not adequately reflect the increasing number of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and their likely needs    As the number of wounded warriors returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan continues to increase  services need to be added to the Montrose campus instead of taken away  said Hall  who is Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs   Montrose needs to be a world class health care facility for our veterans    The Montrose VA campus is critical to serving the needs of veterans in the Hudson Valley  said Lowey   The facilities and land must remain dedicated to serving the needs of local veterans if we are to care properly for those who have served this nation    Engel said  It is essential that we keep our promises to our veterans  promises made for their service to our country  It is not only enough to have help available for them  but it must also be close enough so they can take advantage of it  Sadly  the increasing number of wounded veterans coming from Iraq and Afghanistan make this facility even more necessity that it had been  We must make the Montrose facility all it can be    I have had the honor of standing shoulder to shoulder with our veterans at Montrose to fight against the closings and cuts proposed under the CARES process  Now  as we come to this critical point in the process we should not forget that these decisions will directly affect our veterans in the Hudson Valley for many years to come  That is why it is essential that any decision made reflects an understanding of the long term needs of our veterans  including those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan now and in the future  said Senator Clinton  I urge the Secretary to consider the very real impact of the available options  and to do what is best for our veterans by choosing to allow Montrose to remain dedicated to serving those who have so bravely served our country    Its critical that we maintain vital medical services at the Montrose campus  said Senator Schumer  We should be fighting tooth and nail to preserve the Montrose campus as a top notch facility where veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan can receive world class medical treatment  As the Secretary considers proposals for the future of the campus he needs to remember the priority is servicing our vets  We cannot accept anything less    Westchester County Executive Andy Spano and Cortlandt Town Supervisor Linda Puglisi recently submitted a proposal for areas designated for reuse at the Montrose campus  which the lawmakers asked Nicholson for a full and fair evaluation of   They also requested that any decision made by Nicholson not preclude Westchester County  the Town of Cortlandt  and other regional stakeholders  from developing the Montrose campus for targeted veterans use until the Department has had an opportunity to hear and consider their proposal    A copy of the letter is below    September 14  2007   The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  NW   Washington  DC 20420   Dear Secretary Nicholson    We have monitored the CARES process regarding the VA Hudson Valley Health Care System with great interest and have actively participated in the Local Advisory Panel meetings held by the VA   As you review the options for the Montrose campus  we want to strongly emphasize our desire to see it remain dedicated to serving the needs of local veterans   We are therefore strongly urging that your final decision ensure the provision of comprehensive medical services at the Montrose VA site     With the commencement of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom  the number of combat veterans is increasing   Advances in medical technology have resulted in fewer deaths  but a much higher rate of servicemembers returning with serious injuries  both physical and psychological  that will require life long care   We are concerned that the VAs projections for veterans needs in the Hudson Valley do not adequately reflect both the increasing number of veterans of Iraq  Afghanistan and potential future conflicts and their likely needs   It is important that any decision made regarding the future of Montrose be grounded in a comprehensive and accurate projection of the number of veterans who could rely on this facility in the years ahead    The Montrose campus affords an opportunity to look broadly at the needs of our veterans   The enhanced use leasing of the Montrose campus mandated by CARES will have a significant impact on this regions veterans and the communities surrounding Montrose   Westchester County Executive Andy Spano and Cortlandt Town Supervisor Linda Puglisi recently presented to us a proposal for areas designated for reuse at the Montrose campus   We ask that you meet with them to give their proposal a full and fair evaluation   Further  we ask that no decision be made that would preclude Westchester County  the Town of Cortlandt  and other regional stakeholders  from developing the Montrose campus for targeted veterans use until the Department has had an opportunity to hear and consider their proposal       In closing  we again express our strong belief that the Montrose campus should remain dedicated to meeting the needs of local veterans   The CARES process should provide world class healthcare to our veterans and any future development of the facilities at Montrose should first and foremost be geared to serving their needs and honoring their service to our nation     Thank you for your consideration   John Hall  Member of Congress Elliot Engel  Member of Congress   Nita Lowey  Member of Congress Charles E  Schumer  United States Senator   Hillary Clinton  United States Senator
