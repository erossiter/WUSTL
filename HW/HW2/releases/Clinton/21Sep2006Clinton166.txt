                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today met U S  Department of Transportation Secretary nominee Mary Peters in anticipation of the Senate  s consideration of her nomination in the coming weeks  During the meeting  Senator Clinton raised a number of important New York transportation issues with Peters and invited her to come and see the facilities for herself  Senator Clinton also presented Peters with a letter outlining many of the state  s most pressing transportation needs  including Amtrak  rail security  including New York City  s rail tunnels   aviation security  Tappan Zee Bridge repairs  air traffic controllers  and New York City capital improvement projects including Moynihan Station  East Side Access and the Second Avenue Subway            New York  s transportation infrastructure is its lifeblood  As the nominee for Transportation Secretary  Mary Peters has the potential to help fund and support many of the vital projects that impact our daily lives  It was a pleasure to meet with her today and to invite her to come and see our transportation needs for herself  I hope that if she is confirmed by the Senate she will ensure that the Department of Transportation continues to focus on New York  s transportation needs     Senator Clinton said following the meeting          A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter is attached       September 21  2006  The Honorable Mary E  Peters  Secretary Nominee  United States Department of Transportation  400 7th Street  S W   Washington  D C  20590      Dear Ms  Peters       Thank you for meeting with me to discuss your pending nomination before the Senate and important transportation related issues in the State of New York   I understand that you have testified before the Senate Commerce  Science  and Transportation Committee and I look forward to reviewing your testimony   I would welcome you to visit many of our transportation related facilities throughout New York State should you be confirmed          As you know  the current transportation reauthorization bill is funded through 2009   For New York  that means  10 07 billion in highway funds and  6 5 billion for New York State  s transit systems  a 19 percent increase in annual average highway spending and a 30 percent increase in public transit funding compared to the previous six year transportation authorization bill   However  we will soon need to begin crafting another reauthorization bill as the Highway Trust Fund that provides critical funding for our highway and transit needs continues to face significant strain in the months ahead        National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission      I authored the Amendment in SAFETEALU creating the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission   As an appointee to that Commission you know that the Commission began operating earlier this year after some delay   The Commission is designed to study the future policy and revenue issues that Congress must deal with as we move ahead   It is intended to be a comprehensive  in depth look at our nation  s transportation needs for the future   We must ensure that our federal highway and transit systems are fully funded and that we address not only congestion issues that plague many modes of transportation but safety issues as well   If you are confirmed by the Senate  you will serve as the Chair of that Commission   I hope that you will continue to work on these critical issues and ensure the integrity of the Commission in conducting a thorough study as charged in the statute        Transportation Security      I remain concerned about outstanding transportation security issues   Obviously  the Department of Homeland Security is charged with many of these security issues   As you know  MTA subways  buses  and railroads move 2 4 billion New Yorkers a year  about one in every three users of mass transit in the United States and two thirds of the nation s rail riders   MTA bridges and tunnels carry nearly 300 million vehicles annually    more than any bridge and tunnel authority in the nation  This serves a population of 14 6 million people in the 5 000 square mile area from New York City through Long Island  southeastern New York State  and Connecticut          In particular  I am concerned about the six Amtrak tunnels in New York City that are in dire need of ventilation  electrical  and fire safety technology upgrades  emergency communication and lighting systems  and emergency access and egress for passengers   I co sponsored an amendment authorizing  470 million for these tunnels as part of H R  4954  The SAFE Port Act   I hope that you will focus on the dangers posed to our transit riders as this legislation moves forward   Given the recent attacks on transit systems overseas I hope that the Department of Transportation will work closely with the Department of Homeland Security to address known vulnerabilities          I am also concerned that we have not invested enough in explosive detection devices in the area of aviation security and I hope that this  along with potential screening of cargo  becomes one of your priorities in the aviation field   We must continue to enact the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission       New York Road Damage from Flooding      I would also like to alert you to damage done to many of our roads and bridges following massive flooding in Upstate New York   On July 1  2006  President Bush issued a major disaster declaration for the State of New York   Should you be confirmed  I ask that you continue to direct significant attention to the rebuilding of these roads and bridges   Roads such as I 88 serve as a vital link between Upstate New York and other parts of the state   As the tourism season continues  we must ensure that our transportation system is working to minimize the economic impact while at the same time ensuring that those who live and work in these areas can continue to move as expeditiously as possible       Tappan Zee Bridge      Congestion remains a significant issue on many of our roads throughout New York   In particular  the Tappan Zee Bridge project will need significant attention in the months ahead   The Tappan Zee Bridge I 287 corridor in Rockland and Westchester Counties is a vital transportation link for that region of New York   The New York State Thruway Authority and Metro North Railroad are coordinating efforts to determine the best way to ease congestion along the corridor   We will need federal support as this project moves forward and I look forward to working with the Department of Transportation on this project       Air Traffic Controllers      I remain concerned about the issues impacting our national air traffic controllers   As you know  our controllers help ensure the safety of nearly 600 million aviation passengers per year   Should you be confirmed I hope that you will ensure that the controllers are treated fairly and that an agreement can be worked out between the FAA and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association   I continue to follow several issues involving staff levels at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control  NY TRACON  and I want to make sure that our towers are appropriately staffed        Capital Improvement Projects      There are several ongoing capital improvement programs occurring within New York and I want to highlight a few of them   The redevelopment of Moynihan Station is an important project that will help ease congestion and transform the old Farley Post Office into a transportation hub   In addition  East Side Access and Second Avenue Subway are two important projects that I believe will increase our transit capacities and ease congestion   I am grateful that in this year  s budget the President included  300 million for the NY Long Island Rail Road East Side Access Project and  102 million to be available for additional projects including Second Avenue Subway   These are just some of the major transportation projects underway in New York       Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization      Next year we will consider the Federal Aviation Administration  s reauthorization bill   I have continually fought to ensure that low cost air carriers expand into many of our airports throughout Upstate and Western New York   In addition  New York has several great facilities and locations that could serve as the home for maintenance and call facilities   Niagara Falls International Airport  Stewart International Airport  and Plattsburgh  International Airport are just three important airports that are working to expand access to key areas of New York   I believe that as commercial aviation expands we must do what we can to entice airlines to ensure jobs within the United States remain here and that we expand access to markets everywhere   If communities are able to draw additional traffic it will bring great benefit to the economy of these and other areas       Amtrak Reauthorization and Funding      I have long supported high speed rail connecting Upstate New York with New York City   To that end  I have constantly supported full funding for Amtrak   We must have a strong  national passenger rail system as so many other countries do   The Senate will soon consider the Amtrak Reauthorization bill   Amtrak is vitally important to New York I hope that the Administration  s Budget next year includes full funding for Amtrak   This year  the Senate FY 2007 Transportation  Treasury  the Judiciary  and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill contains  1 4 billion in grants to Amtrak   While this is not the entire amount of funding needed to fully upgrade capital and operate fully  it is a step in the right direction   If you are confirmed  I hope that you will ensure that our national passenger rail system continues to improve and that high speed rail for parts of New York will be factored into any expansion of the existing system          I look forward to the Senate  s consideration of your nomination            Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
