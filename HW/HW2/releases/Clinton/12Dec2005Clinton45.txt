                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Highlight Immediate Need to Increase Funding for Low Income Home Heating Assistance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  joined by Senator Chuck Schumer  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Governor of Pennsylvania Edward Rendell  launched the Democrats    Energy Independence 2020  plan  and kicked off a series of forums around the country to highlight the Democratic plan and spotlight innovative efforts underway to promote use of alternative energy sources that would be greatly accelerated under the Democratic plan   They called on President Bush and the Republican leadership in Congress to stop blocking Democratic efforts to provide  2 9 billion in additional funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  to help the millions of Americans who are struggling to meet record high costs for home heating this winter  A Senate Democratic Policy Committee report released at the event details the staggering cost of inaction on energy independence and the impact of skyrocketing energy prices on American families and businesses              We need to put America on the path to energy independence with policies that promote advanced energy technologies  not by subsidizing oil companies like the President s energy plan does   We also have an urgent need to help millions of Americans who will face the highest heating bills they have ever seen this winter   Yet the President and the Republican leadership in Congress have stood in the way of our every attempt to increase heating assistance over the last few months   The American people are counting on us to fully fund the heating assistance program before Congress adjourns for the holidays  and it is time for the President to stop blocking heating aid to seniors and low income Americans   said Senator Clinton           The record high prices we ve seen this year for gasoline and home heating are proof positive that our current energy policy provides no real solutions for our energy future   While energy companies make record profits and we grow even more dependent on foreign oil  family budgets feel the pinch   The energy agenda we re putting forward today gets serious about reducing our need for oil  using American innovation to develop new  clean sources of energy  and providing desperately needed relief to average Americans   said Senator Schumer             Energy is critically important to America  s future and our national security  Democrats are going around the country to have an open  honest discussion about the best way to secure our energy future   said Senator Reid    Today  we  re launching our plan to make America Energy Independent by 2020 because we know that America can do better than an energy policy that only benefits special interests  Democrats want a fresh start and our plan will make America cleaner  greener and more secure     said Senate Democratic Leader Reid         If the federal government follows the leadership of the states there would be many significant benefits  including less reliance on the Middle East and more on   Middle America    By changing how and where we spend energy dollars  we can create more jobs  increase domestic investment and make our nation safer   Governor Rendell said   What we are doing in Pennsylvania offers a vivid illustration of how our economy  our quality of life and our security can be improved by investing in America  s fuels     Today  s energy story in Pennsylvania provides a template for the nation   Governor Rendell added   Energy production  energy policy and energy politics are not new to Pennsylvania  Our experience over the last 150 years has taught us what energy can do for our economy when handled right and what it can do to our economy when mishandled         The DPC report released today drives home that increased energy costs are taking a toll on the American economy  businesses  consumers  and families  The bottom lines of businesses across the country  particularly the airline  trucking  agriculture  and manufacturing sectors  have been hit hard   Unfortunately  rather than taking action to improve conservation and lower prices  the Bush Administration has stood by and allowed energy prices and oil company profits to reach unprecedented levels           Democrats believe the Federal government must do a better job of protecting consumers  businesses  and farmers burdened by today  s skyrocketing energy prices   We must also break our country  s dangerous reliance on foreign energy   With leadership and vision  we can help ensure low cost supplies of sustainable energy that will improve America  s security  reduce the burden on middle class families  and help clean our environment   Democrats have a strategy to make America energy independent by the year 2020 by reducing burdens on consumers and the environment  launching an Apollo Project for energy  diversifying and expanding our energy supplies  improving energy security and reducing price volatility  reducing demand for oil and natural gas  and investing in efficiency and American jobs          Democrats will highlight this plan and discuss local energy concerns at a series of regional forums in January   Following on today  s Northeast kick off  these events will include a Southern energy forum led by Senator Lincoln focusing on biofuels  a Northwest energy event led by Senator Cantwell  a Midwest forum led by Senator Durbin on household energy costs and Southwest events led by Senate Democratic Leader Reid and Senator Salazar focusing on renewable energy                           The Senate Democratic Policy Committee
