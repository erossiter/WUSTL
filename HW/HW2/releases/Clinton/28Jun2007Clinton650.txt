June 28  2007 Schumer  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Approves  1 Million for University at Albany s Nanotechnology Center                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bill Designates a Partnership Between University at Albany s College of Nanoscale Science and NIST  Making It a National Center of Excellence for Nanotechnology R   Senators Worked Closely with Committee to Include Funding in Spending Bill   Bill Will Now be Sent to the Senate Floor                                                                                                    Washington  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Commerce  Justice  Science  and Related Agencies FY08 Appropriations Bill which includes  1 000 000 for the The New York Center for National Competitiveness in Nanoscale Characterization  NC 3 at the University at Albany  The bill also includes language which makes the Center one of six centers in the country to be working with the Department of Commerce on nanotechnology research  The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process  Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include funding for the project in this years spending bill  This is great news for Albany and the entire Captial Region  said Schumer  This crucial funding will cement the partnership between NIST and U Albany making this research hub a national center of excellence  and a leader in nanotechnology research  Not only will this underscore the Universitys position at the forefront of nanotechnology research but it will attract many companies to the area creating new jobs and making Albany and New York companies competitive in the global market  Furthermore  having this federal research center here in Albany ensures that the government is giving money back to New York taxpayers  This is the beginning of a sustainable relationship that will continue to benefit all involved for years to come  This is great news and is more positive reinforcement for the regions capacity to lead the nation in nanotechnology research and development  I am thrilled that our colleagues in the Senate have seen the value in the Centers research and have taken steps to recognize them  not only with this funding but with their official inclusion as one of the six institutions in the country that will be working with the Department of Commerce on nanotechnology research  New York deserves to be working with the other elite centers around the country and leading our efforts into this incredible field of research and development  Senator Clinton said  The  1 000 000of federal funds will be used for The New York Center for National Competitiveness in Nanoscale Characterization  NC 3  a partnership between the National Institute for Science and Technology  NIST  and the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering  CNSE  of the University at Albany to advance nanoscale metrology innovations and strengthen the resulting RD manufacturing commercialization eco system  in accordance with the report entitled Sustaining the Nations Innovation Ecoystem by the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science  Technology  PCAST   This project fits into in the NIST account  This funding is critical to bolster the RD and education programs in critical dimension environmental scanning electron microscopy technology  focused ion beam methodologies  dual electron and focused ion beam techniques for metrology of 3D nanostructures as well as many other programs that would advance nanoscale metrology innovations  In addition  the following language  which designated the Center as a partner with the NIST  was added to the legislation  The Committee recognizes the strategic and technological importance of advances in nanotechnology to the U S  global competitiveness and considers nanoscale sciences and technologies as critical to promoting U S  innovation and advancing measurement science  standards  and technology  The Committee recognizes the importance of the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST  Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology  CNST  and supports initiatives to develop nanotechnology based innovations and encourages collaborative relationships with research universities and private corporations to advance such initiatives  The Committee recommends and authorizes the NIST to designate the New York Center for National Competitiveness in Nanoscale Characterization  NC 3 at the University at Albany  New York as a collaborative center with CNST to advance nanoscale metrology innovations and strengthen the resulting RD manufacturing commercialization in support of the American Competitiveness Initiative  ACI   Within the increased budget for CNST the Committee appropriates  1 million in FY2008 funds to support the NC3 and CNST collaborative Center  The College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering at the University at Albany is the first college in the world devoted exclusively to the research  development and deployment of innovative nanoscience  nanoengineering and nanoeconomics concepts CNSE is located in the most advanced research complex of its kind at any university in the world  The  3 billion  450 000 square foot complex attracts corporate partners from around the world and offers students a one of a kind academic experience  and it is growing  The complex is also home to CNSEs New York State Center of Excellence in Nanoelectronics The CNSE complex  financed through more than  500 million in governmental support and over  2 5 billion in corporate investments  houses the only pilot prototyping facilities in the academic world for the two standard sizes in computer chip design  the 200 millimeter  or 8 inch  wafer  and the 300 millimeter  or 12 inch  wafer  CNSE has more than 150 U S  and worldwide partners  including some of the world s largest semiconductor and semiconductor related tool manufacturing companies  The work under way is the fastest growing research area at U Albany  and includes efforts to develop  magnetically doped semiconductors with the potential for faster computer processing speeds with lower power consumption  the creation of sensor chips that can instantaneously and non invasively check the bloodstream for glucose levels as well as disease  working models of products that employ alternative power technologies  such as fuel cells  microturbines  and solar cells  and NEMS  nanoelectricmechanical structures  that enable chips to exercise decision making capabilities  These projects are just three of many that have attracted over  1 billion in funding from organizations which want to be at the forefront of nanotechnology research  including IBM and the US Navy  Now that the bill has been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee  it will be sent to the Senate floor  Following approval by the Senate  the bill will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature
