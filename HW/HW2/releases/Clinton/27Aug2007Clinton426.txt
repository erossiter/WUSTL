August 27  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC   This resignation is long overdue  and so is the appointment of an Attorney General who will put the rule of law and our Constitution above partisan politics    Attorney General Alberto Gonzales took an oath to uphold our Constitution and respect the rule of law  but time and time again  he demonstrated that his loyalties lie with the President and his political agenda  not the American people or the evenhanded and impartial enforcement of our laws  In his actions and inaction  from warantless wiretaps to the firing of U S  Attorneys  his loyalty was to the President  not the American people    The Departments hardworking lawyers  law enforcement officers  and staff are trusted to defend our Constitution  not one Administration or political party   That trust is central to the sanctity of the rule of law and the vitality of our democracy   Because he betrayed his obligations and the trust of the American people  I welcome todays announcement that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has resigned his post as Attorney General of the United States    My hope is that the President will select a new Attorney General who will respect the rule of law and abandon partisanship  who will serve the American people and not the Presidents political ideology  and who will answer to the Constitution and not political operatives   It is past time to clean up this mess and restore non partisan accountability and competence to the Department of Justice    The second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina is one more reminder that the President must appoint someone to lead the Department of Justice with the leadership and competence necessary to defend the Constitution
