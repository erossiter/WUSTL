                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Legislation Will Provide Support for the Growing Number of Grandparents and Other Relatives Raising Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Today  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Olympia Snowe  ME  introduced The Kinship Caregiver Support Act  The legislation provides assistance to families in which children are being raised by relatives other than their parents         A growing number of children are growing up in a household headed by a grandparent or other relative  In New York alone  more than 500 000 children are cared for by non parent relative caregivers  In Maine  nearly 11 500 children live in such households  Nationwide  grandparents head 4 5 million households and other relatives head another 1 5 million households         In introducing the legislation  Senator Clinton honored the grandparents and other relatives who take on the responsibility of caregiving despite the financial burden and other challenges   So many grandparents and other relatives are making great personal sacrifices to provide safe and loving homes for the children in their care  Kinship families without formal custody of the children in their care face even greater challenges and this legislation will help reduce unnecessary barriers   said Senator Clinton          Many parents find themselves facing a grim reality    they are not able to support their children financially   said Senator Snowe   While it is natural for relatives to provide for these needy children  the current system often is not set up to accommodate family involvement  In many cases  close relatives are not even informed when the state assumes responsibility for their grandchildren  nieces  or nephews  We must do everything we can to help families to stay together  and this legislation will go a long way toward improving our child welfare system         The Kinship Caregiver Support Act will provide these families with the guidance they need to learn how to obtain health care coverage for the children in their care  apply for housing assistance  locate childcare  enroll children in school  and gain access to other services         It will also make it possible for grandparents and other relatives to care for children who would otherwise be in the foster care   Too often  abused or neglected children stay in foster care because grandparents or other relatives who want to become legal caregivers are unable to take on the responsibility unless the children are given up for adoption  This legislation will allow relatives to become formal guardians and to receive some financial assistance   said Senator Clinton         Finally  this legislation will require States to notify grandparents and other close relatives when children enter the foster care system  Unfortunately  grandparents and other relatives often do not know when their grandchildren or nieces and nephews come under the care of the State   Notifying grandparents and other relatives when children enter the foster care system will make it easier for families to stay together   said Senator Clinton         THE KINSHIP CAREGIVER SUPPORT ACT       Nationwide  more six million children  that is  1 in 12 children  are living in households headed by grandparents or other relatives  i e    kinship caregivers    Kinship caregivers  who often become parents unexpectedly  face unique challenges to successfully raising children  Some of those challenges are financial  others are logistical and or emotional  This bill attempts to address the full range of challenges facing kinship caregivers         Title I  The Kinship Navigator Program        Research has shown that one of kinship caregivers  greatest challenges in raising their children is obtaining accurate information about the services available in their communities  To address this problem  this provision provides 3 year grants to state agencies  agencies serving large metropolitan areas  and Indian tribal organizations to create  kinship navigator  programs  These funds will help              Establish toll free hotlines  websites and resource guides on the state and local parenting support available to kinship families  such as how to enroll children in school  obtain health insurance  safeguard homes for small children  overcome legal issues  and find childcare              Promote partnerships between government organizations  private not for profit agencies  and faith based organizations to help address the fragmentation that creates barriers to helping kinship families              Create kinship care ombudsman who will actively intervene with service providers to help kinship caregivers get the services they need         Title II  Subsidized Guardianship        This provision will make it possible for kin to serve as permanent legal guardians for children who would otherwise be in foster care  States will have the option to use their Title IV E funds to provide payments to grandparents and other relatives who have assumed legal guardianship of children they ve cared for as foster parents  A few states  such as Illinois and Maryland  have implemented subsidized guardianship waivers through the HHS demonstration project  and have shown them to be a cost neutral  effective way to keep families together             To prevent fraud  families would only be permitted to receive subsidized guardianship payments if the child has in foster care for at least 12 months              States will also be required to notify relatives when children enter the foster care system  This legislation is endorsed by the Children s Defense Fund  the Child Welfare League of America  Grandparents for Children s Rights  Generations United  the AARP  the National Caucus of Black State Legislators and the Evan P  Donaldson Adoption Institute
