May 19  2006 New York Congressional Delegation Calls On Secretary Johanns To Protect The Livelihood Of NY Grape Growers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Members of Congress Call for Emergency Disaster Assistance to Aid Grape Growers Following Devastating Spring Freeze Washington  DC    A bi partisan coalition of New York  s Congressional Delegation is calling on U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  Secretary Mike Johanns to provide disaster assistance to grape producers affected by the spring freeze   In a letter initiated by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Brian Higgins  29 members of the New York Congressional delegation called on the USDA Secretary to immediately authorize disaster assistance to ensure that grape producers can recover and continue to contribute to the overall economic health of the state  s agriculture industry            Mother nature has not been kind to New York  s grape growers but the recent adverse weather has come at an especially bad time  We must step in and help our growers  which is why we are urging Secretary Johanns to review and grant this request as quickly as possible     Senator Clinton said    New York farmers know better than anyone that if their crops can t grow  neither can our economy  This federal assistance is crucial to keeping our farmers on their feet financially and preserving the economic lifeblood of countless New York communities  Weather disasters cannot be prevented but financial devastation can                Western New York grape growers desperately need help from our federal government to right the economic crisis they are finding themselves in     said Rep  Higgins     Our grape crops are the lifeblood of hundreds of producers in our region  and the loss will be vast and hard hitting               On April 25th and 26th  freezing weather caused major damage to grape crops in New York State at a time during their growth when buds were extremely susceptible to damage   It is estimated that over 200 grape producers on over 6 400 acres in four Western New York counties    Chautauqua  Cattaraugus  Erie  and Niagara    will suffer combined losses exceeding  9 1 million dollars            Western New York is home to the largest continuous acreage of Concord grapes in the world and generates over  41 million annually for its producers   It also contains the headquarters of the largest Concord and Niagara based grape cooperative  National Grape  Welch  s  the largest private label juice company in the U S   also has a large presence in Western New York   In 2004  the state wide grape and wine industries provided 23 000 full time equivalent jobs and contributed over  3 3 billion in economic value to the state  s economy  according to a recent study by Napa Valley based MKF Research LLC          Unfortunately  the freeze came at a very bad time for the grape industry  as most producers have faced a two year period of over supply and very low prices resulting in either low or non existent profit margins   Crop loss is likely to force some vineyard operations out of business  while others struggle to cope   In addition  the loss will have broader negative economic ramifications for support industries  including lending institutions  farm equipment suppliers  and fertilizer and nutrition suppliers  which depend upon the business of the affected producers          Emergency disaster assistance would open up a much needed opportunity for grape producers to recover from the recent combination of economic and weather related hardships and would contribute to the overall economic health of the entire state         Click here for the estimated crop value losses for each affected county      A copy of the letter is attached          May 19  2006      The Honorable Mike Johanns  US Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Ave  SW  Washington  DC  20250      Dear Secretary Johanns       We are writing to urge you to assess the damage to grape growers affected by recent severe freeze in New York State and to urge you to provide USDA disaster assistance as appropriate   Preserving the viability of our grape farmers is critical to our state  s economy            The unseasonable freeze on April 25th and 26th  2006 occurred at a time when primary buds were at the one inch growth stage and were extremely susceptible to damage   As a result  there will likely be catastrophic crop losses this year   Over 200 grape producers on over 6 400 acres in four Western New York counties    Chautauqua  Cattaraugus  Erie  and Niagara    are estimated to suffer losses exceeding  9 1 million dollars            In 2004  the New York State grape and wine industries provided 23 000 full time equivalent jobs and contributed over  3 3 billion in economic value to the state  s economy  according to a recent study by Napa Valley based MKF Research LLC   On an annual basis  this figure should be viewed as conservative  as the 2004 grape crop and corresponding wine and grape juice production  were significantly reduced due by an unusually severe winter freeze   As the fastest growing agricultural industry in New York State and as a major driver of agro tourism  the grape and wine industries comprise two major economic sectors of the state          This crop loss comes at a very bad time specifically for the labrusca grape juice industry  since the industry has been faced with a two year period of over supply and very low prices  resulting in either low or non existent profit margins for most grape producers   This spring  s freeze damage is likely to force some affected vineyard operations out of business  while others will increase borrowed capital  which is already limited   In addition  the loss will have broader negative ramifications on support industries and surrounding rural communities which are dependent upon economic contributions from the grape industry          We ask that you please work expeditiously with the county and state Farm Service Agencies  FSA  to conduct a survey of damage in the areas impacted by the freeze  additionally  in order to deal with the damage  assistance must be expedited to ensure adequate recovery and farm viability through the rest of the season          We urge you to give this request your full consideration and we thank you in advance for your assistance   We look forward to working with you on this important matter           Sincerely
