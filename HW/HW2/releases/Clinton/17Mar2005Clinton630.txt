                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Clinton Also Has Meetings with Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and Mrs  Geraldine Finucane  wife of Pat Finucane                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the United States Senate passed by unanimous consent today a resolution condemning the violence and criminality by the Irish Republic Army and calling for peace in Northern Ireland   The resolution  sponsored by Senators Clinton  Kennedy  McCain  Dodd  Biden  Leahy and Lautenberg expressed support for the sisters of Robert McCartney in their pursuit of justice for the murder of their brother   The resolution calls upon the leadership of Sinn Fein to   insist that those responsible for the murder and witnesses to the murder cooperate with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and be protected fully from any retaliation by the Irish Republican Army             I am pleased that the Senate quickly and unanimously approved this important resolution     Senator Clinton stated     Our government should offer full support and all appropriate assistance to law enforcement authorities in Northern Ireland to help make sure that the murderers of Robert McCartney are brought to justice           Senator Clinton reiterated her concerns about the murder of McCartney yesterday when she met with the McCartney sisters and again today when she met separately with Taoisearch Bertie Ahern and Geraldine Finucane whose husband  Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane  was murdered in 1989   Senator Clinton stressed that she believed that just as the investigation into the murder of Pat Finucane must be open  public and transparent  so too must the investigation into the murder of Robert McCartney             The Finucane family has been seeking justice and a truly independent  public inquiry and the British government must give them that public inquiry   I believe the McCartney sisters deserve an equally fair and independent inquiry into the murder of their brother   There is absolutely no justification for this senseless violence and justice demands a thorough public investigation    Senator Clinton said         The following is the text of the resolution        109TH CONGRESS  1ST SESSION  S  RES   ll         Condemning violence and criminality by the Irish Republican Army in  Northern Ireland        IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  Mr  KENNEDY  for himself  Mr  MCCAIN  Mr  DODD  and Mrs  CLINTON  submitted the following resolution  which was referred to the Committee on  ___________       RESOLUTION Condemning violence and criminality by the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland  Whereas on January 30  2005  a Catholic citizen of Belfast  Northern Ireland  Robert McCartney  was brutally murdered by members of the Irish Republican Army  who attempted to cover up the crime and ordered all witnesses  to be silent about the involvement of Irish Republican  Army members        Whereas the sisters of Robert McCartney  Catherine McCartney  Paula Arnold  Gemma McMacken  Claire  McCartney  and Donna Mary McCartney  and his  fianc    e  Bridgeen Karen Hagans  refused to accept the  code of silence and have bravely challenged the Irish Republican Army by demanding justice for the murder of  Robert McCartney        Whereas when outcry over the murder increased  the Irish  Republican Army expelled 3 members  and 7 members of  Sinn Fein  the political wing of the Irish Republican  Army  were suspended from the party        Whereas the leadership of Sinn Fein has called for justice   but has not called on those responsible for the murder or any of those who witnessed the murder to cooperate directly with the Police Service of Northern Ireland        Whereas on March 8  2005  the Irish Republican Army  issued an outrageous statement in which it said it     was  willing to shoot the killers of Robert McCartney      and       Whereas peace and violence cannot coexist in Northern Ireland        Now  therefore  be it Resolved  That       1  The Senate joins the people of the United States in deploring and condemning violence and criminality by the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland  and     2  it is the sense of the Senate that       A  the sisters and fianc    e of Robert 7 McCartney deserve the full support of the  United States in their pursuit of justice      B  the leadership of Sinn Fein should insist that those responsible for the murder and witnesses to the murder cooperate directly with  the Police Service of Northern Ireland and be  protected fully from any retaliation by the Irish Republican Army  and    C  the Government of the United States  should offer all appropriate assistance to law  enforcement authorities in Northern Ireland to see that the murderers of Robert McCartney are brought to justice
