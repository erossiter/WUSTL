September 14  2005 Key Senate Panel Acts to Make College More Affordable and Accessible Legislation Includes Much of Senator Clinton  s Non Traditional Student Success Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Legislation to help make college more affordable and accessible to thousands of New York students passed a major hurdle last week after winning approval by the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  on which Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton serves            Many students are drowning under the debt of their student loans and it is limiting their life and career choices   This bill increases need based grant aid by  5 5 billion and takes some important steps to reign in the cost of college     said Senator Clinton            Specifically  the bill increases financial aid for students by raising the maximum authorized Pell Grant to  5100 in the 2006 2007 school year   providing 417 000 New York students with a total of  1 35 billion in need based grants   Low income students who study math and science will also be eligible for additional financial aid     1 billion in total    as an incentive to enhance our competitiveness in these critical fields where we are currently lagging behind our global partners            The bill also strengthens the Direct Loan program  which is dramatically more cost efficient than the government guaranteed program   According to the Bush Administration  s Office of Management and Budget  government guaranteed loans cost taxpayers about 12 cents on the dollar  while direct loans cost less than a penny on the dollar   Under this bill  those with Direct Loans who enter public service will be able to opt for an income repayment plan that dismisses their outstanding loans after ten years of service   Students will also retain their ability to consolidate their loans at a low fixed rate          Additionally  the bill creates more accountability for rising college costs by requiring the Department of Education to annually publish and rank the cost of a full time undergraduate education at each college in the country  as well as the average cost over the last ten years   The bill also requires the Department of Education to create a higher education cost index so students will have an independent barometer against which they can evaluate increases in the cost of college  And it authorizes the first comprehensive study of the factors contributing to rising tuition  and the most effective ways to reign in college costs in          Your average student graduates with equivalent of one full mortgage in student debt     said Senator Clinton    While we need to do more to help students afford college  this bill is a big step forward           The committee approved bill also includes a number of provisions from Senator Clinton  s Non Traditional Student Success Act  which will make college more accessible and affordable for students who are older  working full or part time  have children  and are the first in their families to go to college          These provisions include          Providing financial aid to less than half time students   Currently only 6  of less than half time students receive any form of financial aid because they are completely ineligible for most aid  including federal loans    Making Pell Grants available year round  Currently  students can only receive Pell Grants during the 9 month school year  making it hard for non traditional students to complete school in a timely fashion  This provision is likely to reduce the drop out rate among non traditional students because they will not be forced to take time off    Permitting colleges to create innovative class schedules  such as 8 hour classes on weekends or in the evenings that are more accessible for working students   Current law only allows students to receive financial aid if their classes extend over 15 weeks    A targeted new program aimed at reducing the college drop out rate among disadvantaged students   The bill authorizes a new program that helps students who did not receive a good high school education to get up to speed academically and graduate  The program encourages colleges to create articulation agreements so that students at two year schools can transfer seamlessly to four year schools      Ending the work penalty   Current law penalizes students who work by lowering the amount they can receive in student aid   This bill allows students to keep more of their earnings  which will help students who are forced to work in order to care for their families             Each of these provisions will help students at schools all across New York such as Adirondack Community College  which has developed a medical device manufacturing training program that is 10 to 12 weeks long  or the Medgar Evers College Certified Nurse Assistant program  which is part of a new biotech career pathway in Brooklyn               Together  these policies will help make New York  s workforce more adaptable and competitive     said Senator Clinton     Some individuals who have lost their jobs due to outsourcing need retraining     said Senator Clinton     This bill offers a real second chance for people who want to finish college              On average  those who complete college earn  1 million more over their lifetime than those who stop their education after high school  according to the College Board   Senator Clinton is a strong supporter of increasing investments in higher education so that every student can go to college if they so choose
