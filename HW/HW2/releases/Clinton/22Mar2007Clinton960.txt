March 22  2007 Senator Clinton Blasts State Department for Unhelpful Comments Over Passports Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Administration Completely Ignoring the Plan s Potentially Severe Economic Impact on New York s Northern Border Communities   Clinton Says Comments by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Also Fly Directly in the Face of Congress  Intentions                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today expressed her dismay over recent comments by Elizabeth Whitaker  Deputy Assistant Secretary of State that the Administration would be circumventing the will of the Congress and ignoring the potentially devastating economic impact of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  on New York s Northern Border communities by requiring passports or other new onerous identification requirements at the Canadian border starting January 1  2008           Ms  Whitaker s comments are not only unhelpful  they demonstrate the Administration s reckless insistence on forging ahead with their WHTI proposal while completely ignoring  the economic realities along our Northern Border   Senator Clinton said   For a long time the Administration has been trying to push forward with this proposal and  though we oppose their initiative  we have attempted to work with them in good faith toward a solution  Congress extended the deadline for implementation so that a thoughtful plan could be put in place   Ms  Whitaker s comments are yet another example of this Administration s complete lack of regard for the real concerns of the American people  These comments cannot go unchallenged or unanswered  especially given that Congress purposely voted to postpone the implementation of the WHTI           Senator Clinton has long expressed her opposition to the WHTI  including the card format passport or  passport card    In a lengthy letter today to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice  Senator Clinton said the Administration s position on the card has  begun to strain credulity  and she seriously questioned its failure to consider the economic impact of the initiative or the data security and privacy concerns it poses to local residents along New York s Northern Border       Below is a copy of Senator Clinton s letter       March 22  2007      The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  Secretary of State  United States Dept  of State  Washington  D C       The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Dept  of Homeland Security  Washington  D C       Dear Madam Secretary and Mr  Secretary       I am responding to a recent statement by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Elizabeth Whitaker who announced that the United States Departments of State and Homeland Security intend to disregard the time extension given for the implementation for the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative   WHTI  or the  Initiative   and forge ahead with the Initiative despite several uncertainties and unanswered questions that remain about the Initiative and its economic impact   Ms  Whitaker s comments are not only unhelpful  but they also demonstrate the Administration s reckless insistence on forging ahead with their WHTI proposal while completely ignoring the economic realities along our Northern Border          As I have explained time and time again  WHTI is a matter of tremendous importance to my constituents in New York  as well as all Americans who live along the Northern Border   While I share the desire to secure our nation s borders  in imposing new travel restrictions at the border  we must remain aware of the profound economic and social impact new restrictions will have on our border communities            I have voiced reservations about the impact of the Initiative in a variety of different contexts since it was first previewed in April 2005   I have written to each of you on this critical matter   I have submitted testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and comments to DHS and State on two separate Proposed Rulemakings   As I have long maintained  I think the approach being taken continues to tilt the balance too far against having a border that is both safe and convenient to cross for most people   I strongly believe that this is an issue on which we can find a solution that protects our security and our economy            There is tremendous and legitimate concern that the Initiative would not only devastate the tourism and retail industry  but also greatly disrupt life on both sides of the American Canadian border   To date  State and DHS s efforts to impose WHTI s identification requirements have completely neglected these concerns   At the root of the Initiative s problems are the cost and the burden it would impose on United States citizen travelers   In addition to cost  the proposal imposes several hurdles to attaining the passport card   No exception is allowed for the elderly or groups of minors on trips   No provision is made for day passes or those who appear at a border crossing without the proper documentation              The practical implications of such a proposal if implemented are enormous    The proposal does little to ease the serious impact the WHTI is likely to have on the tourism and retail industries on both sides of the American Canadian border    The exchange of goods between the United States and Canada is the largest trading relationship in the world   On average   1 1 billion in goods cross the border each day    This number is likely to decrease dramatically if an individual is forced to purchase a  45 passport card   or an even more expensive passport   several weeks in advance in order to cross the border   A decrease in cross border travel would be devastating to the economies of both the U S  and Canada   The impact would cripple border communities such as the Buffalo Niagara region in New York   According to the Buffalo Niagara Partnership  Partnership   which represents nearly 3 000 employer members  requiring a passport for entry into the U S  will devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the U S  Canada border     M ajor tourism developments  such as the over  100 million Bass Pro Project in Buffalo  are being planned based  in part  on the substantial buying power of Canadians in Metro Toronto and Southern Ontario   The Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres are dependent upon ticket sales to fans from Southern Ontario who have the option of watching the games on television rather than in person             Areas such as the North Country of New York would also feel a profound impact   According to the Plattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce and its thousands of members   to require passports  or NEXUS cards where available  for U S  and Canadian citizens to cross the U S  Canadian border     will substantially discourage cross border travel  and  will depress travel and economic benefit  for both nations              Given the considerable evidence that the WHTI would have a dramatic and negative effect on the economies of border communities  it amazes me still that State and DHS still have not conducted a review of the economic impact of the Initiative  and have not completed a single cost benefit analysis of their proposed passport card requirement and potential alternatives   In fact  State continues to take the position that a passport card rule is not an  economically significant regulatory action   that the rule is  not likely to have an annual effect on the economy of  100 million or more or to adversely affect in a material way the economy       or State  local  or tribal governments or communities   and therefore no rigorous cost benefit analysis is necessary under the law at all   This position has begun to strain credulity   It is simply reckless to plow ahead with WHTI without taking into account the serious economic impact it poses          The Government Accountability Office  GAO  concluded earlier this year that DHS and State had yet to make many key programmatic and technical decisions regarding the Initiative and that the remaining issues present numerous challenges   Congress has given the Administration an extra year and a half in order to implement new border crossing rules with care   Once again  in the strongest possible terms  I urge the Administration to use the additional time to perform a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the costs and benefits of the Initiative and the passport card requirement  with an emphasis on the impact the requirements would have on the economies of our border communities  and a careful review of alternatives   The stakes are far too high for the Administration to continue to march forward in the dark on this important issue without any understanding of the economic consequences of its proposed plan   It is why the recently passed Improving America s Security Act of 2007 contains a provision requiring a WHTI economic impact study          I am hopeful that we can find a solution that properly balances our mutual interest in a secure Northern Border with our desire to maintain communities that are both economically and socially vibrant          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
