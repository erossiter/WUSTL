                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Private Marketing Firm to Collect Personal Data on Millions of Students                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   U S  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today called on Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to stop efforts to collect and to analyze personal information on high school students that go beyond data collection efforts permitted under current law  Senator Clinton also urged the Pentagon to reverse its decision to use a private marketing firm to gather and disseminate this sensitive data  given the potential for privacy violations  identity theft and other misuse         It is critical that we do everything we can to make sure that our most sensitive personal information stays out of the wrong hands  That s why it is so troubling that the Pentagon is using a private firm to collect and analyze sensitive personal information about high school students  Given the serious privacy concerns at stake  I urge the Pentagon to reverse its decision to use a private firm to collect this information and urge them to adhere to the data collection standards under current law          Under the No Child Left Behind Act  the government is allowed to collect basic information about students  name  address and phone number  According to news reports  the private firm will gather and disseminate to the Pentagon a wider range of student personal data  including Social Security numbers  ethnicities  birth dates  class schedules and grade point averages  The private firm will collect the data from schools and from commercial data brokers  state drivers  license records  and other sources        Senator Clinton and six fellow Senators sent a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld today outlining their concerns  The letter  signed by Clinton along with U S  Senators Jon Corzine  D NJ   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Russ Feingold  D WI   Maria Cantwell  D WA   and Ron Wyden  D OR  is reprinted below                  Dear Secretary Rumsfeld        We are writing in response to recent reports that the Pentagon has retained a private marketing firm to gather and to analyze extensive personal information from high school students between the ages of 16 and 18 for the purpose of identifying potential military recruits  We ask that you immediately cease these efforts        We are particularly troubled by the fact that you plan to rely on commercial data and have hired a private marketing firm to assist with the collection and analysis of this sensitive information  As you know  this private company is being given the responsibility to collect  and to disseminate to the Pentagon  personal information of students such as birth dates  social security numbers  ethnicity  grade point averages  address and telephone information  and areas of study  This personal information  which would be obtained from schools as well as from commercial data brokers  state drivers  license records  and other sources  could then be used to formulate and execute a targeted  marketing  campaign to identify and recruit individuals based on these personal factors         We recognize the need for a strong military and support the efforts undertaken by the Pentagon to recruit individuals to serve in our Armed Forces  However  we can not condone the hiring of a private company to collect and disseminate the most private information about our youth  We are concerned both with the potential violation of privacy interests and with the potential for identity theft and other misuses of this personal information  We fail to see a legitimate need for the creation of a database containing such personal information and are concerned that it may be an inappropriate effort to profile students based on ethnicity and other personal factors  We are certain that you share this concern and are not in favor of a private marketing campaign conducted on behalf of the military that could improperly use personal information to do just that         Again  we ask that you immediately cease the creation of this database and stop this private company from collecting and disseminating students  personal information  We also ask that you immediately post  on the Department of Defense website  a standard  opt out  letter that students may execute to stop military recruiters from using their personal information to contact them at home  Thank you for your attention to this important matter
