February 28  2007 Senator Clinton Calls for Action to Address Economic Vulnerability Created by Growing Foreign Held Debt                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called for action to address the growing vulnerability to the US economy from our increasing foreign held debt citing that foreign nations now hold nearly half or more than  2 2 trillion of all public debt with China and Japan holding nearly  1 trillion   In remarks on the floor of the Senate and in a letter to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke  Senator Clinton underscored that yesterday s stock market losses  the biggest point loss since September 11th  2001  should be a wake up call of the risk to our economy of the continuing erosion of our economic sovereignty            When it comes to the fiscal recklessness and economic fatalism of the current administration  the writing might not be on the wall but yesterday the writing was on the Big Board   The economic policies of the last six years have contributed to an erosion of US economic sovereignty and have made us more dependent on the economic decisions of other nations   said Senator Clinton    We need to take steps to restore fiscal responsibility and sound economic policies based on the facts not ideology   said Senator Clinton in remarks on the Senate floor          The following is the text of Senator Clinton s letter to Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke       The Honorable Henry Paulson     Secretary       United States Department of the Treasury   1500 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW    Washington  D C  20551      The Honorable Ben S  Bernanke  Chairman  Federal Reserve Board  20th Street and Constitution Avenue  NW  Washington  D C  20220      Dear Mr  Secretary and Chairman Bernanke       It is with great concern that I witnessed the recent volatility in the global markets and the undeniable impact it had on U S  markets    Indeed  I believe that the economic policies of the last six years have contributed to an erosion of U S  economic sovereignty and have made us more dependent on the economic decisions of other nations   Moreover  I believe that action should be taken now to address some of the underlying issues that contributed to yesterday s market disruption           Markets to a certain degree will always be volatile  and to a great extent we are fortunate that our domestic markets are deep enough to absorb certain shocks  But what happened yesterday underscores the exposure of our economy to economic developments in countries like China   As we have been running trade and budget deficits  they have been buying our debt and in essence becoming our banker   While the President has touted recent improvements in the overall budget deficit picture  it is undeniable that the exponential growth of foreign debt in the last six years has undermined our economic standing   We have to curb these deficits and ensure foreign governments don t own too much of our public debt and take steps to ensure that our economic well being is soundly in our own hands           I have long argued that a great source of vulnerability is the fact that other countries  including China  own so much of our debt   Today  foreign nations according to the most recent Treasury statistics hold over  2 2 trillion or 44  of all publicly held United States  U S   debt with Japan and China alone holding nearly  1 trillion   In essence  16  of our entire economy is being loaned to us by the Central Banks of other nations  Having so much debt owned by other countries can be economically unsound   Yesterday it was the sell off of foreign stocks that had reverberations in U S  markets   But if China or Japan made a decision to decrease their massive holdings of U S  dollars  there could be a currency crisis and the U S  would have to raise interest rates and invite conditions for a recession   While it can and will be debated whether yesterday s market disruption was just a blip or a larger indicator of our economy s vulnerabilities  it is clear that interdependence between our economy and that of other nations can pose a risk if we do not pursue smart policies  Precipitous decisions by any country with our debt could create much graver economic problems than what we saw yesterday   The writing may not be on the wall  but yesterday  the writing was on the Big Board          In years past  I have worked with other members of Congress who share many of the same concerns on this issue   For example  during the last session of Congress I supported legislation by Senator Dorgan and then Congressman Cardin that sounds an alarm bell when US foreign owned debt reaches 25 percent of GDP or the trade deficit reaches 5  of GDP   It would require the Administration to develop a plan of action to address these conditions  and report their findings to Congress   At the very least this proposal would compel our government to deal with these economic issues while they are problems and before they become crises   I believe that proposals like these need to be discussed in order to put our economic house in order as we can too easily be held hostage to the economic decisions being made in Beijing  Shanghai and Tokyo           Thank you for your attention to this matter  and I hope that we will have an opportunity to discuss these issues          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
