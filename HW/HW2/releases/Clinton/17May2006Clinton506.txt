                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senator is working to create a national grant program that would support Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities    Senate Committee hears from New York City pioneer in the provision of services to older Americans                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling for the establishment of a national grant program to support Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities  NORCs    a concept pioneered in New York   and make them a permanent part of the national strategy for helping older adults age with dignity  Senator Clinton is working to include legislative language into the Older Americans Act that would recognize Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities  NORCs  and provide grants to NORC Supportive Service Programs  NORC SSPs   The Older Americans Act is scheduled to be reauthorized during the 109th Congress  There are over 40 officially recognized NORC SSPs operating across New York State  including programs in Albany  Bronx  Queens  Brooklyn  Manhattan  Plainview  Rochester  Syosset and Troy          Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities  NORCs  are defined geographic areas not originally built for seniors but that over time become home to a large concentration of older people  such as a neighborhood or apartment complex   NORC Supportive Service Programs  NORC SSPs  are designed to promote healthy and successful aging in these communities and to respond to the changing needs of residents over time by supporting them and their families in the community  bringing services and assistance to seniors who  in the past  faced loneliness and isolation and may have had nursing homes as their only option for getting needed care   Typically  NORC SSPs help identify services and service providers and coordinate service delivery  The programs bring together public and private agencies to provide the elderly with integrated services  including preventative health care and social activities             With a rapidly expanding older adult population  it is critical that we focus attention on the increasing needs of older Americans and the demands placed on our local  state  and federal health care and social services systems   NORC Supportive Service Programs play a significant role in addressing these very real challenges by helping seniors stay in their homes where they have long resided     Senator Clinton said           Senator Clinton emphasized the critical role of NORCs at a hearing of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Subcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging yesterday   At the hearing  Senators heard from one of the pioneers of the NORC movement  Fredda Vladeck  the founding Director of the first NORC Supportive Service Program  NORC SSP  in New York City and the current Director of the Aging in Place Initiative at the United Hospital Fund  New York has played a pioneering role in developing and expanding NORC Supportive Service Programs  The first professionally staffed NORC SSP was developed under the helm of Ms  Vladeck in 1986 in the Penn South Houses  a 10 building complex of cooperative apartments housing more than 6 000 residents in New York City  At the hearing  Senator Clinton recognized Ms  Vladeck  s achievements and said she wanted to build on the model she had established            As I talk with seniors across New York  I hear that one of the things they want most is to stay in their own homes  in their own communities  The NORC model not only respects seniors   overwhelming preference to age in place  to remain at home in the neighborhoods where they have lived for years  but also values their active participation in shaping their communities as good places to grow old     the Senator said          Senator Clinton  s proposal would establish a permanent federal grant program for NORC Supportive Service Programs within the Older Americans Act    By supporting NORCs and NORC SSPs  Senator Clinton aims to recognize the importance of community for positive and healthy aging and to support the programs that make it possible           NORC Supportive Service Programs provide a range of positive outcomes  not only for residents  but for the community at large  For example  NORC SSPs promote healthy aging by engaging seniors in preventative care before a health crisis occurs and by responding to their changing needs as they age over time   As a result  this approach helps prevent the premature or unnecessary institutionalization or hospitalization of seniors in short and long term care facilities and it provides a cost savings to Medicaid and local taxpayers           Another important ingredient of NORC SSPs is the partnerships they forge between the public and private sectors  uniting housing entities and their residents  health and social service providers  government agencies and philanthropic organizations   Through these partnerships  NORC Supportive Service Programs are able to offer a range of services  from social and health programs to educational  recreational and volunteer opportunities  that are diverse  flexible  and designed to engage as many community residents as possible         Click here to
