                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Woodbury  NY   Today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with Long Island Business News to convene a panel of business  community and health care experts from throughout Long Island to take part in a health care forum in Woodbury   The forum was the third in the series Taking Action on Health Care and attracted numerous local stakeholders to discuss some of the major issues affecting the health care system  including affordability  quality and access   The panel also focused on challenges facing the region and some of the promising efforts underway           During her opening remarks  Senator Clinton outlined some of the major challenges affecting the health care system  our country is not getting its money  s worth for its health care dollars  we spend more per person than any nation in the world  yet our life expectancy ranks thirty fourth and more than 46 million Americans don  t have any health insurance at all  including 8 million children  the incentives inside our health care system are backwards and the payment system is upside down  too often paying for costly treatment but not for low cost prevention  and the market now rewards businesses that unload health care costs onto employees and local governments  while punishing companies that try to do the right thing              America has the greatest medical system in the world  We are blessed with dedicated  skilled  caring doctors and nurses  with world class hospitals and facilities and with medical innovation and research that  s second to none     Senator Clinton said    But we  ve also got 46 million people without insurance    including some 8 million children  Businesses and families in New York are struggling with rising health care costs and with health insurance premiums that are increasing five times faster than incomes             On Long Island  where residents already face an extraordinarily high cost of living  individuals and families pay 11  and 6  more in premiums  respectively  when compared to national averages           Senator Clinton emphasized that we need a uniquely American approach to solving our health care challenge and highlighted her work in the Senate to tackle these problems  including efforts to                Create an interoperable health IT infrastructure  marrying technology and quality to reduce medical errors  help contain costs and improve the care patients receive              Help patients make better  more informed choices by supporting comparative effectiveness studies to determine the most appropriate  safe  and cost effective treatments              Improve access to home and community based services that help seniors remain in their homes and communities   and provide tax credits for those who purchase long term care insurance              Create small business purchasing pools    like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP  and provide small businesses  including self employed Americans living and working at home  with tax credits for offering coverage  adding affordable choices and increasing purchasing power  and             Increase the focus of health care to include prevention             Today we have an opportunity to talk about health care  to think about how we reconcile our values with how we deliver that care    in the present and future    and to discuss how we can control cost  improve quality  and make our health care system accessible to every single American     Senator Clinton said    With our values as our guide  and with the greatest medical system in the world as our greatest resource  I believe we can begin to address the challenge    and forge a new direction in our health care system             Senator Clinton was joined by several panelists including Michael Dowling  President and Chief Executive Officer of the North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System  Matt Crosson  President of the Long Island Association  Wendy Chaite  President of the Lymphatic Research Foundation  Johanna Richman  Chief Financial Officer at AHRC Nassau  and Jeff Rogoff  Vice President for Long Term Care at St  Catherine of Siena Medical Center and Martin Glynn  President   CEO of HSBC Bank USA           Senator Clinton is working on all fronts to tackle our health care challenge  She has collaborated with Senator Bill Frist to pass legislation in the Senate that would create an interoperable health IT infrastructure  She has joined with Senator Lindsey Graham to expand access to TRICARE military health care benefits for members of our National Guard and Reserve and worked tirelessly to make sure our veterans have the medical care they need and deserve  She has introduced legislation to fix problems plaguing the new Medicare prescription drug benefit  And  as co founder and co chair of the Senate Manufacturing Caucus  she is at the front lines of examining how we can help our manufacturers cope with the crushing costs of healthcare benefits           Senator Clinton has also fought to increase federal health care dollars for New York to ease cost pressures on local budgets and to enable more low income New York families to access healthcare coverage  helping secure a temporary increase in the federal matching rate for Medicaid which brought  1 4 billion to our state and cosponsoring legislation to extend the availability of the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   providing nearly  1 billion in additional funding for New York           The previous healthcare forums in the Taking Action on Health Care series were held in Buffalo at University of Buffalo and in Rochester
