July 17  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Support of the High Risk Non Profit Security Grant Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Recent events in the U S  and the ongoing conflicts around the world are tragic reminders of the vulnerabilities we continue to face here at home  We must protect institutions that are potential targets for a terrorist attack  a list that sadly includes relief and community based organizations  non profits  faith based organizations and religious institutions  It is simply unacceptable that nearly three years after passing this legislation  we are still arguing over its importance and trying to get this essential support to our most vulnerable non profits          These organizations need to be able to focus on the provision of community services without fear of attack  That is why I was pleased to support the establishment of the High Risk Non Profit Security Enhancement Act of 2004 and continue to support efforts to ensure that last year s funds reach the institutions that need them and that the program is fully funded for next year  We must ensure that vulnerable non profit institutions have the resources they need to be safe and secure             Last month  Senator Clinton added her support to an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill that would fund the Non Profit Security Grant program  Senator Clinton was also a co sponsor of the original High Risk Non Profit Security Enhancement Act of 2004 which formed the basis of the program  In the past year  because of bureaucratic disagreement  funds had ceased to be awarded from the program  The High Risk Non Profit Security Enhancement Act of 2004 was developed in response to the increasing need to protect high risk non profit institutions  faith based organizations and religious institutions from terrorist attacks  The bill established a grant and federal loan guarantee program at the Department of Homeland Security to assist high risk non profit organizations with security enhancements  so that they can better protect against terrorist attacks
