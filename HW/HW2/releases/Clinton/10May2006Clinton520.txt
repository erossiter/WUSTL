                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Buffalo  NY    Today Rear Admiral John E  Crowley  the new commander of the 9th Coast Guard District is visiting Buffalo   In light of his visit  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congressman Brian Higgins  NY 27  are calling for the consolidation of Coast Guard land and facilities at Sector Buffalo  opening 20 acres of land around and access to the historic Buffalo Lighthouse for public use          In a letter to Admiral Thomas H  Collins  Commandant  U S  Coast Guard  Senator Clinton and Congressman Higgins wrote that Coast Guard Sector Buffalo  as currently situated  prevents public access to a significant part of the City  s waterfront  including the Buffalo Lighthouse   They urged the Coast Guard to contribute to the momentum and economic development underway in Buffalo  and to consider the proposal discussed in March 2006 between Congressman Higgins and Rear Admiral Robert J  Papp  Jr   Commander  Ninth Coast Guard District  on Sector Buffalo land consolidation              The consolidation of these facilities could help the City of Buffalo realize the full potential of its Outer Harbor without compromising the essential security and safety role played by the Coast Guard  This is a proposal that Congressman Higgins and the people of Buffalo have been talking about for some time  I hope that Rear Admiral Crowley  while he is in Buffalo  has an opportunity to see the proposal for himself and to help us make this idea a reality     Senator Clinton said             Senator Clinton understands the importance of green space and public access along our city  s waterfront  and I am pleased to team up with her in this important initiative     said Congressman Higgins     These 20 acres would add to the momentum we  re seeing at the Outer Harbor  with full access to our historic Lighthouse without sacrificing any of the homeland security  search and rescue  navigational and other services the Coast Guard provides to Buffalo and other Lake Erie communities   The Lighthouse  the oldest public building in Buffalo  is a symbol of the waterfront  s significance in our past and will be a symbol again for our future as we focus on bringing downtown back to the waterfront               Currently the Coast Guard occupies 30 acres surrounding the Buffalo Lighthouse and limits access to parts of the Outer Harbor   The specific proposal Higgins and Admiral Papp discussed in March encourages the Coast Guard to consider consolidating its operations to ten acres  leaving 20 acres of waterfront property  including the historic lighthouse  for public access           Coast Guard Sector Buffalo is located at the head of the Niagara River and the eastern end of Lake Erie   Sector Buffalo provides search and rescue  law enforcement  aids to navigation  recreational boating safety  marine environmental response  and ice operations services to the public   Its area of responsibility includes Lake Erie from Lorain  Ohio  to Buffalo  New York  the Niagara River  Lake Ontario  the Finger Lakes  the Erie Canal  and the St  Lawrence Seaway to Massena  New York             A copy of the letter is attached          May 10  2006      Admiral Thomas H  Collins  Commandant  U S  Coast Guard  Coast Guard Headquarters  2100 Second Street  SW  Washington  DC 20593    Dear Admiral Collins     In light of Rear Admiral Crowley  s visit to Buffalo today  we are writing to endorse the consolidation of Coast Guard land and facilities at Sector Buffalo              Coast Guard Sector Buffalo currently occupies 30 acres on the Outer Harbor in the City of Buffalo   As it is currently situated  the base prevents public access to a significant portion of the City  s waterfront  including one of our community  s most historic landmarks  the Buffalo Lighthouse   Consolidating Sector Buffalo could free up to 20 acres for public green space and trails along the water  s edge  and restore public access to the Lighthouse             This proposal presents a timely opportunity for the Coast Guard to contribute to the new momentum and nascent economic development underway in Buffalo  development which is centered on our waterfront   Local officials have reached consensus on a development plan at the Inner Harbor  which will create jobs and attract investment downtown   Also  we have worked to secure funding for infrastructure to improve access to the Outer Harbor  which will attract hundreds of millions of dollars to develop our currently underutilized urban waterfront   We invite the Coast Guard to participate in this exciting development by freeing up Outer Harbor land at Sector Buffalo for public use without affecting Coast Guard security or service in the area             The search and rescue  law enforcement  homeland security  aids to navigation  recreational boating safety  marine environmental response  and ice operations services provided by Sector Buffalo are invaluable to the public and deeply appreciated   We look forward to working with you to ensure that the consolidation of Sector Buffalo will not degrade its ability to perform these essential functions           Economic development at the Outer Harbor is absolutely crucial to sustaining Buffalo  s new sense of confidence and attracting investment to our community   Thank you for your consideration of this important proposal  and for addressing how Sector Buffalo can play a part in Buffalo  s revitalization             Sincerely            Hillary Rodham Clinton                       Senator       Brian Higgins  Member of Congress         CC  Vice Admiral Robert J  Papp  Jr   Chief of Staff  United States Coast Guard Rear Admiral John E  Crowley  Jr   Commander  Ninth Coast Guard District
