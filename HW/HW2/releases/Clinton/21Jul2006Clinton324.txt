July 21  2006 Schumer  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Approval of  15 Million in Defense Funding for Long Island                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Funds included in Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed approval late yesterday by the Senate Appropriations Committee of the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill  which includes  15 million for Long Island           The bill will now proceed to the Senate floor for consideration   Following consideration and passage on the Senate floor  the bill will head into a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between the two bills  Following conference  the bill will again be sent to the House and Senate for final approval  after which it will be sent to the President for his signature            With so many brave men and women serving this country  this funding is good news both at home in Long Island and abroad     Senator Schumer said    This money will help give our troops the most technologically advanced equipment possible while investing in Long Island  s local economy               As our men and women in uniform continue to fight bravely overseas  these New York companies are helping to support them with the best equipment and technology available  This funding is a tremendous boost to these local companies who are on the cutting edge of research and development and are also local employers  contributing to our regional economy  As we look to develop the state  s future as a center for research and results  these are the kinds of investments that we need to continue making     Senator Clinton said          Funding in the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill includes          ATK Alliant Techsystems    Scramjet Research    6 million    The bill appropriates  6 million in funding to continue development of scramjet technology needed to integrate and demonstrate hypersonic strike platforms  such as the United States Air Force  s X 51B vehicle  In a continuing effort to push technology forward  this Air Force program seeks to bring the HyTech engine to a flight test and provide a flight test platform for future technology development   Air Force Research Laboratory  AFRL  advocates working to integrate an alternate engine concept into the X 51A program  thus broadening the program  s technology base   Additionally  this program is coordinated with continuing NASA research to ensure broad potential applicability       Telephonics    Aircraft Wireless Intercom System  AWIS     2 million    Funding will support the acquisition and installation of non encrypted AWIS kits for Active and Reserve Force MEDEVAC aircraft   AWIS will provide enhanced safety and communications linkage between flight crew and medical personnel on board the aircraft during air and ground operations   Currently  there is no integrated communication system between the MEDEVAC flight crew and medic once the medic leaves the aircraft to attend to the on board loading of patients aboard the aircraft   The AWIS will provide capability that will allow medic personnel freedom of both hands to perform onboard medical procedures while communicating with the flight crew  and eliminate the safety hazards and operational restrictions inherent to the existing tethered system   Voice communication between crewmembers and medical personnel during critical phases of rescue operations is essential to the safety of patient and crew   Battlefield necessity supports fielding of the available non encrypted AWIS now   The benefits of AWIS serve the Army imperatives of aviation flight safety and force health protection and decreased battlefield aviations incidents through the insertion of technology enhancement to forward medical care   It further provides enhanced   aviation team coordination    during medical evacuation       STIDD    Diver Propulsion Device    2 million    This bill appropriates  2 million to STIDD Systems  Inc in Greenport  a leader in commercial marine seating and maritime SOF mobility platforms  STIDD currently employs over 60 people and is a prime supplier of underwater submersibles and shock mitigating seats to the Department of Defense Special Operations Forces   The Diver Propulsion Device  DPD  is a mission essential surface and underwater mobility platform for combat divers   The DPD replaces the traditional mode of physically demanding in water manual propulsion   The DPD allows divers to carry additional gear  reduce infiltration and exfiltration times  cover large distances areas quickly during reconnaissance searching tasks all while conserving both energy and time for other mission requirements   Use of the DPD by the Army  s Diving Units  to include the Engineer Dive Teams and the Special Forces Dive Teams will transform their ability to accomplish their respective missions   Army Engineer Dive Teams will utilize the DPD as a means to move personnel and equipment quickly and efficiently while executing port construction rehabilitation and ship husbandry  repair         Truetech    M291 Skin Decontamination Kits    2 million    The M291 SDK is a skin decontamination kit fielded by the US Army   The lightweight  portable kit decontaminates skin from known nerve and blister agent threats without harming the skin and the adsorbent and reactive resin technology provides a unique system for the decontamination of chemical warfare agents  which has been approved by the FDA 510 k  clearance process   The technologically advanced polymeric adsorbent  containing a bimodal pore system  provides for rapid adsorption of chemical agents from skin  effectively sequestering the agent and preventing skin penetration   The functionalized reactive resins in the M291 SDK provide for chemical decontamination of the agent  rendering it impotent         BAE Systems    High Altitude Hyperspectral Imaging  SPIRITT  for the Navy  s SHARP Program    3 million    SPIRITT provides a 24 hour capability to discriminate camouflaged or concealed targets from decoys as well as detect chemical agents  gas plumes and buried objects   Hyperspectral techniques detect and identify targets based on spectral signature  this technology also distinguishes disturbed earth anomalies that identify IEDs  buried mines  subterranean fortifications  and personnel vehicle travel routes   The SPIRITT sensor combines visible and infrared high resolution imagers with hyperspectral sensors   Hyperspectral discrimination techniques are used in the Visible  Short Wave Infrared  SWIR  and Long Wave Infrared  LWIR  bands to detect targets and to cue high resolution imagers for target identification   Real time on board processing is used for rapid precision targeting   The Navy needs to fulfill its baseline requirement for standoff Day Night imaging and the Hyperspectral P3I for SHARP   The sensor being flown as part of the USAF SPRITT ATD has demonstrated outstanding performance for standoff day night high resolution imaging and hyperspectral imaging techniques   The first flight tests of the four band sensor were conducted in Aug 2005 with outstanding results   The superb performance displayed in the initial test flights has led to an enhanced program to conduct operational military utility evaluation and the extension of the ATD application to additional platforms
