October 31  2007 Letter to Constituents on the 110th Congress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Dear Constituent   As the first session of this Congress draws to a close  I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on the progress we have made together standing up for New York in the United States Senate  As your Senator  I have worked hard to change the direction of our country and address the concerns of New Yorkers from one end of our state to the other  I hope you find this information helpful  If you would like to learn more  you can always visit my website at http   clinton senate gov   As always  joined by Senator Schumer and the entire New York delegation in the House of Representatives  I am working hard on the issues that affect our families  Whether on matters of national security or retirement security  rising gas prices or rising health care costs  I have stood up for New Yorkers and proposed practical solutions that rise above partisanship  I am proud of what we have achieved together   Sincerely  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton    Changing Course in Iraq  Of course  there is no greater issue confronting our nation than changing course in Iraq  As the first New York Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  I remain focused on the many challenges we face there  I have urged the Bush Administration to end the current failed policy in Iraq that forces our troops to police a civil war  And I am working hard in the Senate to advance a strategy to redeploy our troops as quickly and as safely as possible   In January of this year  the President announced an escalation of the number of troops in Iraq  Unfortunately  this was not a new course  but a continuation of the same broken policy  Our troops have done everything we have asked of them and more  I believe it is time to start bringing them home   I traveled to Iraq in January  soon after the Presidents announcement  to assess the situation there firsthand  This was my third visit to the country  where I expressed my gratitude to our troops on the ground and met with Iraqi leaders and U S  commanders  I came back from the trip determined to stop the Presidents escalation  and to start the long overdue redeployment of troops  One month after returning from that trip  I introduced the Iraq Troop Protection and Reduction Act to halt the Presidents escalation policy and to provide an alternative strategy to stabilize the country  a strategy that would enable the President to end the war before he leaves office    Specifically  my bill would cap the number of troops in Iraq at the level before the Presidents escalation  It would be against the law to send more  I also set out to protect our troops  who are performing heroically  by prohibiting the use of funds to send them to Iraq unless they have the proper equipment and training  This is critical in light of Februarys Department of Defense Inspector General report  which concluded that the U S  military is still failing to adequately equip our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan   My bill also aims at putting real pressure on the Iraqi government  requiring them to make political progress on key issues  such as ensuring that the Iraqi security forces are free of militia or sectarian influence  or lose funding for their military and reconstruction  Such provisions would increase our leverage with the Iraqi government and send the message that there are consequences for continued inaction   Finally  my legislation would require the Bush Administration to both begin a phased redeployment  which I have been advocating for almost two years  and convene an international conference of Iraqs neighbors  to reduce regional interference in internal Iraqi affairs and encourage more countries to contribute to Iraqs extensive needs  If the administration fails to meet these requirements within 90 days  a new Congressional authorization would be required to remain in Iraq   In May  I announced that I would join with Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia to introduce legislation to end the presidents authorization for the use of force in Iraq  We would require the president to ask Congress for a new authorization if the administration seeks to continue the war  I also voted against a bill to continue the war in Iraq because it failed to compel the President to give our troops a new strategy  I fully support our troops  That is why I cannot and will not support funding legislation that does not begin to bring our troops home  Our men and women in uniform are serving bravely and honorably and funding a failing strategy does not serve our troops or our nation   Last  I have also called on the Bush Administration and the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on any existing contingency plans for the withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq  or to provide an explanation as to why such plans have not been properly created  In August  I followed up on this request by introducing legislation to require that the Pentagon prepare a report and briefing for Congress on this issue  Congress must be sure that we are fully prepared to withdraw our forces without any unnecessary danger  We cannot afford to repeat past failures  such as not planning adequately for the conflict and failing to properly equip our men and women in uniform  Withdrawal will require careful planning   Fighting for Quality  Affordable Health Care for All  Health care is often the issue I hear about the most from New Yorkers  concerned by rising premiums and rising ranks of uninsured  I believe it is time to fix our broken health care system  and that is exactly what I am working to achieve in the Senate   I am proud to report  for example  that the Senates Health Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  of which I am a member  passed my bipartisan Wired for Health Care Act  which would help use health information technology and private electronic medical records to cut costs  to improve quality  reduce errors  and increase efficiency  It will help patients get the care they need  and help doctors  nurses  and health care providers to do their jobs  It is so important that we modernize our health care system and I am working with both Democrats and Republicans to pass this important bill into law   One of the most heartbreaking facts in our health care system is the number of uninsured children in our country  Nine million children have no health insurance  including 400 000 children in New York  In the Senate  I have proposed legislation to provide access to affordable health insurance to every single child in America  I supported the expansion of the Childrens Health Insurance Program which would have covered nearly 4 million additional children  I was proud to help create the CHIP program as First Lady  which today covers 6 million children  helping almost 400 000 New York children every month   I was deeply saddened when the President vetoed the bipartisan legislation to expand the program  which would have helped 72 000 more children in New York alone  I will continue to fight to provide health insurance to all children  as I have proposed in the Senate  and to pursue quality  affordable health care for all Americans  No child should be invisible in our country or in our health care system   While working to cover more children  I also continue to work to make our health care system safe for children  We passed into law the Pediatric Research Improvement Act  legislation I introduced to ensure that drugs marketed for children are first proven safe and effective for children  This is an issue that I have worked on ever since I was First Lady  parents have a right to know that doctors are not forced to play guessing games when it comes to treating sick kids   In addition  I continue to work to help seniors afford and access the treatment they need  I supported legislation to give the federal government the ability to negotiate better prescription drug prices for seniors  and continue to advocate for the safe reimportation of prescription drugs  I also authored legislation to allow safe and affordable generic versions of drugs  called biologics  for diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  Non Hodgkins lymphoma  and multiple sclerosis  among others  I introduced the Medicare Quality Enhancement Act to provide seniors with information on the performance of health care providers so seniors have the evidence to make better health care decisions   I am also proud that legislation I cosponsored to provide mental health parity  which helps people with mental health needs get the treatment they require   passed the Senates Health Education  Labor and Pensions Committee earlier this year  I also introduced two bills  the Gestational Diabetes Act and the Diabetes Treatment and Prevention Act  to address rising rates of diabetes and to improve access to preventive care  in order to prevent more costly complications from this disease   Finally  I continue to advocate for ethical stem cell research  which holds the promise of new cures for Alzheimers disease  Parkinsons disease  Diabetes  and so much else  I support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  which would lift the ban on federal funding for this promising avenue of research  I was deeply disappointed that the president vetoed this bill  which amounted to a veto on hope for millions of Americans   Improving Education and Making College More Affordable  I continue to support real solutions to improve our nations schools  I cosponsored the Head Start for School Readiness Act  which will expand Early Head Start so more children start school on the right foot  I have also introduced the Ready to Learn Act  which helps states and local organizations establish and improve the pre K choices available to parents   Once children reach primary school  I believe every child deserves an education that unlocks his or her potential  That is why I have fought to fix the No Child Left Behind Act so that our students are not only held to high standards  but are also prepared to meet them with a quality education  I have offered several proposals to improve teacher quality  school leadership  and mentoring   Of course  fixing our education system will lift up our children and our country  especially as globalization means we are competing on the world stage  I cosponsored the America Competes Act which passed into law this year  The goal of this law is to improve math and science education  The final bill included two of my proposals  First  we will study educational excellence in math and science so that we can replicate success from school to school  The second proposal  which Senator Schumer and I offered  will create two new fellowship programs   modeled on the highly successful Newton Fellowship and Newton Master Teacher programs in New York City   to help train the next generation of science  math  engineering  and technology leaders   Finally  I am proud to report that we passed into law the largest increase in student aid in more than a decade to help students afford a college education  This bill will be the key to unlock the doors of college for many families  We increased Pell grants to  5 400 over the next five years  and New York students will already see more than  200 million in additional aid for the school year beginning next fall  Provisions from my Student Borrowers Bill of Rights were also included  This will help ensure that students receive accurate information on their loans and are not burdened with unaffordable monthly payments  Parts of my Non Traditional Student Success Act were also included  to support students who are working or raising families while also attending college   Fighting for the Heroes and Victims of 9 11  In March of this year  I chaired the first Senate hearing to ever examine the urgent health concerns of countless New Yorkers whose health has been affected because of September 11th and the toxic cloud of chemicals and debris that filled the air after the attacks  And in June  as chair of an environmental subcommittee  I led a hearing to examine the environmental impact of the 9 11 attacks   This builds on years of working with my colleagues in the New York Congressional delegation on behalf of the heroes and victims who survived the attacks   but did not survive unharmed  Many have suffered serious health problems as a result of the attacks  and so I have worked to fund monitoring and treatment programs   work that continues to this day   Earlier this year  Senator Schumer and I fought and won  3 6 million for 9 11 health needs that President Bush attempted to rescind in his budget  We also secured approval in the Senate for an additional  55 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those exposed to environmental hazards as a result of the attacks  This was the first legislation to expand 9 11 health programsto residents  office and commercial workers  students  and others who were exposed  We have a duty to rescue the rescuers who came to our aid at our moment of need  and a responsibility to all those who have a suffered in the wake of the horrific events of that day   Protecting Children  Supporting Families  In 35 years of public service  as and advocate for children and families  as First Lady  and as Senator  I have always believed that we have a duty to protect children by supporting parents raising the next generation   This year  I reintroduced the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act of 2007  This bill was named in honor of two year old Cameron Gulbransen  a Long Island boy who was killed when his father accidentally backed over him in his driveway  It aims to reduce the incidence of child injury and death in these kinds of accident  This bill proposes modest  cost effective steps so that we can prevent so many tragic accidents   I also proposed a series of steps to help parents struggling to balance work and family  Since President Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act  FMLA  into law in 1993  more than 50 million Americans have taken advantage of it  but we can go further  I am also a proud original cosponsor of the Healthy Families Act  which would provide working people with seven paid days of sick leave  giving parents time off from work to go to the doctor with their child or aging relative or to address their own health concerns   As part of these efforts  I have worked to improve the availability of quality child care  a struggle for so many working parents  Every week  more than 12 million children under six years old are in child care  That is why I introduced the Quality Child Care for America Act to invest in child care professionals  And I continue to work to help families often overlooked  For example  more than six million children in America  one out of twelve  are living in households headed by grandparents or other relatives  In New   York City alone  there are more than 245 000 adolescents living with grandparents  As relatives who often become guardians unexpectedly  these generous family members face unique challenges to successfully raising children  That is why I reintroduced the Kinship Caregiver Support Act to help these families navigate what can be a difficult path   We also have to protect our children from lead poisoning  There are still more than 24 million homes in the United States that have lead paint  with nearly 1 2 million units in New York alone  I have proposed a tax credit for safely removing lead based paint from homes  offering much needed incentives for property owners to ensure homes are free of environmental dangers that can harm our children   Finally  in the 44 years since Congress enacted the Equal Pay Act  women have shattered so many barriers  But many women and families are still held back by the unfair pay gap  Today  women working full time  year round  still earn only 77 cents for every dollar that a man earns  I reintroduced the Paycheck Fairness Act  to build on the Equal Pay Act  to help close the pay gap and close the door on wage discrimination   Moving Toward Energy Independence  Our current dependence on foreign oil poses a challenge to our economy  our environment  and our security  I have worked toward real solutions in the Senate to help turn the energy challenge into an opportunity to end our dependence on foreign sources of oil  combat climate change  protect our security  and create millions of new jobs   Achieving these goals will require national leadership  That is why I have introduced legislation to jumpstart a clean energy future  The bill would reform our energy tax system by shifting incentives away from polluting energy sources and towards clean energy technologies  To accomplish this goal  I have proposed the establishment of a  50 billion Strategic Energy Fund paid for by eliminating tax breaks for oil companies  already reaping historically high profits  and making sure they pay their fair share to create a clean energy future  The fund would be used to support the deployment of wind  solar  biofuels  and other clean energy technologies     We also passed the Clean Energy Act of 2007 through the Senate in June  This bill will increase our energy independence and fight global warming  It increases fuel economy standards for new cars and trucks  promotes renewable biofuels  institutes stronger efficiency standards  and protects the American consumer from price gouging at the gas pump  The bill also includes several provisions I authored  including a training program to help meet the growing need for skilled workers in the energy efficiency and renewable energy markets  and a provision to save taxpayer money and reduce pollution by making federal buildings more energy efficient   I am a cosponsor of legislation to require 20 percent of our electricity to come from renewable sources like wind and solar by the year 2020  A recent study found that achieving this goal would create 185 000 jobs  save consumers  10 5 billion dollars  combat climate change  spur  66 7 billion in new capital investment  and increase income to farmers  ranchers and rural landowners by  25 6 billion  I also support legislation to help promote the development of renewable fuels like ethanol   Finally  I have proposed legislation to ensure that all new and renovated federal buildings become zero emissions buildings by 2030  The federal government owns or leases about 500 000 buildings  and this legislation would reduce the  5 6 billion that the federal government spends to heat  cool and power them  I have also proposed a  1 billion Green Building Fund to help state and local governments make schools and other public buildings more energy efficient   Safeguarding the Environment  I am a cosponsor of the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act which sets a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050  I have authored legislation which passed into law to require the Secretary of Defense to consider the effects of climate change on our national security  The amendment implements recommendations from a report issued in April by eleven retired three star and four star admirals and generals   I worked to pass the Water Resources Development Act  This legislation will reform the way the Corps of Engineers does business  and includes important water resource projects in New   York State  And I am a cosponsor of the Great Lakes Collaboration Implementation Act of 2007  a bipartisan Great Lakes restoration bill that would help to reduce the threat of invasive species in the lakes  restore fish and wildlife  clean up contaminated sediments  and coordinate water quality management in the Great Lakes basin   Another piece of legislation  the Toxic Chemical Exposure Reduction Act  will require the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to set tougher regulations to protect the public from exposure to a carcinogenic chemical called TCE  I introduced the bill because this chemical is one of the most widespread industrial water contaminants in the nation found at many sites in New York  My effort is a response to lengthy delays by EPA in setting a new standard in the face of growing scientific evidence  I continue to believe that science  not politics  should dictate how we protect our children and families from pollution and toxins   Preserving the Dream of Home Ownership  In light of the ongoing turmoil in the housing market and the uncertainty surrounding millions of homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages  I recently introduced the American Home Ownership Protection Act to regulate unscrupulous mortgage brokers  empower borrowers with better information about their mortgages  and eliminate the worst elements of abusive mortgages  I also recently reintroduced the 21st Century Housing Act to modernize the Federal Housing Administration  FHA  so that it can be a viable alternative to the subprime mortgage market  Reforming the FHA is a practical step we can take to keep millions of Americans out of dangerous mortgages   Protecting our Security  I also continue to fight for smart  strategic homeland security  With policies based on evidence and funding based on risk  not politics   I am proud to report that this year Congress passed legislation to distribute more homeland security funding based on risk  And I continued my fight to restore the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to an independent  Cabinet level federal agency  to ensure that it has the authority it needs to effectively manage future crises   I also continue to work to improve emergency communications  I secured more than  43 million for investments in our 911 system  With the growing use of mobile phones and Internet based phone service  upgrading our nations emergency call centers so that they can locate and respond to all 911 calls  whether they come from a land line or a cell phone  is one of our top public safety concerns   I also offered legislation to continue the ban on disposable butane lighters from being carried aboard airplanes  The Transportation Security Administration  TSA  reversed their policy to ban these lighters  and contradicted their own previous position on the danger as well as the evidence of the threat  I proposed continuing the ban until Congress and TSA could better review the issue   I have successfully passed legislation to halt the Administrations plan of privatizing our homeland security  And I also successfully passed legislation to bar the Department of Homeland Security from paying bonuses to contactors who fail to do their jobs  It is wrong and I am pleased to help put a stop to it   Investing in Infrastructure  In the Congress  we have also worked to improve our nations infrastructure  I have fought for air safety and proposed reducing airspace congestion in the New   York area airports  And I called for  and secured  an investigation into dangerous near misses at our airports   I also testified before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure  Safety  and Security at a hearing on Rail Safety where I called for better security and safety on our nations railways  After a series of train derailments in upstate New York  I have called for a series of investigations and reforms to improve rail safety   In addition  the bridge collapse in Minneapolis is a tragic reminder of the growing challenges we are facing across the country to fix our crumbling infrastructure  Roadways  bridges  railroads are aging and face growing strain  The Senate passed the National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2007  bipartisan legislation I introduced with several colleagues  to address the deteriorating condition of our nations roads  bridges  drinking water systems  dams and other public works  The legislation would establish a National Commission on Infrastructure of the United States  charged with aiding in the nations economic growth by ensuring the nations infrastructure meets current and future demand  It is an important first step  I also worked with my colleagues in the Senate to secure an additional  100 million for New Yorks aging bridges  New York State has more than 17 000 highway bridges  with 12 percent classified as structurally deficient  and 26 percent classified as functionally obsolete   Supporting New Yorks Rural Communities and Small Towns  New Yorkers in rural communities and small towns also face particular challenges  and together we are working to address them  I introduced the Rural RISE Act which targets funding and policies toward helping rural and agricultural communities  so people have the opportunity to work and raise families in the hometowns they love   I have made it a priority to expand access to broadband  to ensure the information age economy reaches every corner of our state and country  including rural areas  My Rural Broadband Initiative would create greater accountability and funding to help bring broadband to underserved areas  I have previously passed broadband tax incentives through the Senate  and I will continue to work to ensure that small businesses and individuals can harness this important economic tool  vital to our success in the 21st century   And I continue to work to support our farmers and rural communities in the Farm Bill  Working with my colleagues in the Senate  we are improving the MILC dairy safety net  strengthening the country of origin labeling law  investing in renewable energy like cellulosic  significantly increasing funding for specialty crop producers  and helping to expand access to healthy fresh foods grown in New York  I also support the Milk Import Tariff Equity Act to level the playing field for our dairy farmers   I was proud to host another Farm Day in Washington to promote and highlight the many wonderful products New Yorks growers and producers have to offer  And I continue to pursue an ambitious agenda for our rural and small town communities  Together  we are working to protect United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  field offices  invest in crumbling schools  promote educational opportunities for rural students  and improve health care in rural areas by recruiting and retaining more health care professionals   Standing Up for Veterans  Supporting Our Troops  One of the most important responsibilities I have as a Senator and a citizen is to honor the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform   and to support our veterans  who are veterans for life   Earlier this year  I visited wounded service members and veterans at Fort Drum  the Syracuse VA Medical Center  Walter Reed Army Medical Center  and Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany shortly after my visit to Iraq and Afghanistan  During these visits  I heard heartbreaking tales of red tape and neglect  and persistent complaints about the process by which the Department of Defense  DoD  and the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  determines disability ratings that establish the level of disability benefits a veteran can receive   In March of this year  I introduced the Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act to restore disability benefits for wounded service members and to begin to fix the process by which disability rating determinations are made  Major provisions of my bill passed the Senate as part of the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act   Last year  I helped enact into law major pieces of my Heroes at Home legislation to help injured soldiers transition home from Iraq and Afghanistan and to support their families  This is especially important for returning service members struggling with traumatic brain injury  TBI  and post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   This year  I followed up on Heroes at Home with a new initiative to strengthen treatment and diagnosis of TBI and to train and certify loved ones as personal care attendants  This will enable them to provide quality care at home while receiving compensation from the VA  instead of struggling to make ends meet while also doing the difficult  often emotionally demanding work of caring for a loved one   In May  I introduced the 21st Century GI Bill of Rights to honor the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan by helping them to afford an education  a home loan  and credit to expand or start a small business   In March  to address the financial hardships faced by many families when a single parent service member makes the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of our nation  I introduced legislation to allow the guardians of a minor child whose parent has been killed in the line of duty to access the military death gratuity and other survivor benefits  I am also a cosponsor of the Retired Pay Restoration Act that would immediately end the prohibition on concurrent receipt of retirement and disability benefits for many disabled veterans   Additionally  in May  I introduced the Supply Our Soldiers Act of 2007 to allow military families to send packages postage free to loved ones deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan  The tremendous sacrifices that our service members and their families are making on behalf of our country should not be coupled with the financial hardship of paying to ship packages overseas  Not only can these packages contain needed supplies  but they also offer personal mementos from home  which can do so much to improve morale   In July  the Senate unanimously passed two resolutions I introduced to recognize the recipients of the Purple Heart  I also continued my strong support of the Purple Heart Stamp  introducing legislation that would make it a permanent forever stamp  I re introduced legislation to include National Korean War Veterans Armistice Day among the days when Americans should make a special effort to display the American flag  And I am a cosponsor of bipartisan legislation that would grant a Federal Charter to the Korean War Veterans Association  I have also introduced the Cold War Medal Act of 2007 to create a military service medal for members of the Armed Forces who served honorably during the Cold War   In September  the Senate unanimously approved two measures that I introduced that will assist military families in need  Specifically  these amendments will increase burial travel allowances for families of deceased service members and increase Temporary Lodging Expenses for service members moving to a military base experiencing a housing shortage   Finally  I have proposed extending the Family and Medical Leave Act to the loved ones of wounded soldiers  so that these family members could take more time off to care for an injured spouse or child  Often  they are forced to choose between the job they need and the family member they love  That is not right  We have a duty to serve the men and women who serve us  And we cannot forget the sacrifice that military families make as well   Fighting for our Workers   In this Congress  I have continued to work to fight for the rights of working families throughout New York and the country    Earlier this year  Congress passed into law the first minimum wage increase for workers in almost a decade  The law will increase the minimum wage to  7 25 by 2009  As in past sessions of Congress  I was an original cosponsor of this legislation  and worked to get it enacted into law    As in past sessions of Congress  I was an original cosponsor of the Employee Free Choice Act   legislation to ensure that workers can exercise their right to organize and bargain collectively without fear of coercion or intimidation  I was also an original cosponsor of legislation to guarantee collective bargaining rights to law enforcement officers when it is introduced in the Senate later this year  and was an early cosponsor of the RESPECT Act   legislation to expand collective bargaining protections to millions of workers designated as  supervisors  by the Bush administration NLRB    I joined with my colleagues to introduce legislation called the FOREWARN Act   which would modernize and improve the enforcement of the federal law that gives workers notice of an impending mass lay off  The legislation is designed to ensure that workers receive a real opportunity to obtain training and find new employment prior to the imminent loss of their jobs    I also cosponsored legislation to strengthen the protection of working conditions in the country  introduced legislation to invest in our nation s child care workforce  and led a bipartisan effort to block the rescission of unspent Workforce Investment Act funds    I was one of the lead cosponsors of bipartisan legislation to overturn the Supreme Court s ruling in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire  Rubber Company  The legislation would ensure that workers are able to enforce their legal right to equal pay under Title VII     I also worked to block the Bush administration from downsizing and privatizing essential government services throughout the state and the country  This session  I introduced and obtained passage in the Senate of a measure to block the Bush administration from downsizing the Federal Protective Service  which provides law enforcement and security services to federally owned and leased facilities throughout New York and nationwide  I also worked with other members to introduce an amendment and get language into an appropriations bill to block the Bush administration from privatizing the employees who operate  maintain and repair the nation s locks and dams
