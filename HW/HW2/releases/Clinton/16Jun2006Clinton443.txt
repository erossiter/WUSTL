Washington  DC    In a major policy address on the challenges of privacy in our increasingly data driven world  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called for a comprehensive privacy agenda  a Privacy Bill of Rights that secures the interests of consumers  stronger  better enforced protection for medical privacy and a new national security consensus setting out clear rules to allow the government to use new intelligence techniques and make sure the public knows its rights and limits   Senator Clinton announced that she will introduce legislation to enact this Bill of Rights  the Privacy Rights and Oversight for Electronic and Commercial Transactions Act of 2006  the PROTECT Act              At all levels  the privacy protections for ordinary Americans are broken  inadequate and out of date   It  s time for a new comprehensive look at privacy   We need consumer protections that are up to date with the technological and national security needs of our time  for a world in which we can be confident that our security and our privacy are both protected     said Senator Clinton     We can protect our privacy in a more data driven and dangerous world   This issue is too important to be dealt with haphazardly or not at all   We need to stand by our cherished American ideals and think intelligently about how they apply in this new century          Privacy Bill of Rights      Senator Clinton underscored that we need a new set of consumer protections that boil down to three basic rights               People have the right to know  and to correct  information which is being kept about them             People have the right to know what is happening to their personal information when they are cooperating with a business and to make decisions about how it is used            And in a democracy  people have the right and the obligation to hold their government and the private sector to the highest standards of care with the information they gather          These rights should be basic to all of the consumer transactions we undertake and be part of a basic Privacy Bill of Rights that has to be adhered to by every commercial information gatherer or marketer       New Privacy Legislation to Ensure These Privacy Rights      Senator Clinton  s Privacy Bill of Rights will be encapsulated in the PROTECT Act  the Privacy Rights and Oversight for Electronic and Commercial Transactions Act of 2006   The PROTECT Act will provide consumers with clear privacy rules  clear protections for their most private information  the right to sue when those rules have been violated  the right to protect their phone records  the right to freeze their credit when their identity has been stolen  the right to know what businesses are doing with their credit and credit reports  and the right to expect the government to use the best privacy practices itself with their personal information   Major provisions will include       Right to Clear Protections of Consumers   Most Private Information   Senator Clinton  s bill ensures that for the most deeply personal information about how we spend money on a daily basis  consumer information will be shared only when consumers   opt in             Right to Sue and Seek Damages   Currently  there is no set definition of what privacy violations cost the individual and little incentive for banks and other businesses in many instances to protect personal consumer data with the highest level of security   As a result  it is very hard for consumers to seek redress through the courts   Senator Clinton  s bill will create a tiered system of damages  exempting the smallest businesses with set minimums of  1000 for breaches and  5000 for actual misuse of information       Right to Protect Phone Records   Right now  it  s too easy to purchase  post or trade cell phone numbers and records   Buying and selling that kind of information is a gross invasion of privacy but it is not clear that it is a crime   This will only get more challenging as more consumers move to phone service based on broadband Internet technology for which no regulations currently exist   Senator Clinton  s legislation will work to get ahead of the curve of technology  making sure that consumers   private cell phone numbers and call records remain private       Right to Freeze Personal Credit   Right now  consumers that are victimized can place a credit   alert     but they cannot freeze their credit   Senator Clinton  s bill would allow consumers concerned their information has been compromised to contact credit agencies and say    no access and no new credit          Right to Know   Senator Clinton believes that the right to know is a critical consumer protection   Her bill would ensure that consumers have the               Right to Know When Identity Theft Happens   Senator Clinton  s bill will require that consumers are notified immediately if their credit or identity is compromised   Notification is currently required in some states but not all   As a result  many identity theft victims are unaware even years later that their information has been put at risk                 Right to Know When Your Data Leaves the United States   Some firms are sending data abroad for processing  away from the protections of U S  law   Senator Clinton would ensure that consumers will be notified when their personal data is sent abroad and have the right to   opt out                Right to Know Your Credit Report   Consumers should have credit information provided to them once each year without paying a fee or jumping through hoops   Senator Clinton  s bill would make this a standard practice       Right to High Standards from Government   The PROTECT Act would create a high level privacy czar in the Office of Management and Budget   This Chief Policy Officer for our government would have oversight into the workings of every government department and the power to make sure the law is being followed and best practices are being implemented          Right to Medical Privacy   Consumers have a right to expect that privacy protections will be enforced   As technology expands and medical information is more widely available  we need to make sure medical privacy protections keep up by ensuring one set of high standards for everyone who deals with healthcare information and making sure that these standards are upheld   We also need to put real teeth in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA  by making sure companies comply with the law and that those who violate it are held accountable
