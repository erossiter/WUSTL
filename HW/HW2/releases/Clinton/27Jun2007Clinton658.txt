June 27  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the One Year Anniversary of the 2006 Floods                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 A full year has passed since the devastating floods ripped through the region   While we have come so far in the past year  we still need to take care of those who are struggling to get back to where they were a year ago    Many areas have also had to deal with even more rain and floods over the past year  causing even more damage to property and testing everyones capacity to endure   Most recently we saw more destructive flooding in Delaware and Sullivan Counties   Despite so much devastation from the floods  the strength of the community became very clear  Neighbors banded together to help cope with the damage and others from around the region and the state came in to assist   The spirit and strength of the community was never stronger    While much has been accomplished in just one short year  we know that more needs to be done  I have worked hard with local community officials since day one to make sure that the full resources of the federal government were made available to the victims of the floods   We pushed FEMA to respond as quickly as possible and pushed the President to make essential funds available  We established a Feed and Forage Exchange to help our farmers and worked with the Army Corps to highlight debris clean up issues  We worked with local businesses to encourage them to stay in the region and pushed the federal authorities to redraft their flood plain maps for the future  Now we are fighting to secure  30 million in Congress to develop and implement improvements to the Susquehanna and Upper Delaware River Watersheds    There is much that can be taken away from the tragedies experienced during the floods  I am committed to working with all of our partners to try and mitigate the impact of future disasters with better communication systems  stronger flood walls and watershed improvements  There is still much more work to be done  Families  small businesses and farmers are still facing the after effects of this disaster   I will continue to work with local  state and federal officials to take care of the regions needs as we move forward
