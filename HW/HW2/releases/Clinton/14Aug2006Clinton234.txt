August 14  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Re  Governor Pataki  s Signing of New Law to Assist 9 11 Rescue Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I am pleased that the Governor has responded to my calls and to those of my Congressional colleagues  and the first responders  workers and volunteers themselves  for help with the obvious health crisis afflicting those who selflessly responded to the September 11th attacks           Last year  we successfully restored  125 million for ongoing health issues related to 9 11  and part of this federal funding included  50 million for the New York State Uninsured Employers Fund  to be used to help those workers who need it  Having urged the Governor to help families like those of Detective James Zadroga  I am grateful that he signed this legislation allowing families of police officers  firefighters  and other uniformed personnel who participated in the rescue  recovery and clean up operations at Ground Zero  to apply for death benefits          In addition  I hope this will assist 9 11 Health Coordinator Dr  John Howard continue coordinating the long term response and bring the appropriate federal resources to bear in helping these heroes  Many of us have been sounding these alarm bells for some time and they must be answered  We must not   and we shall not   forget the sacrifices made on that day and the sacrifices that continue to be made years later             In April  Senator Clinton joined U S  Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ   and Charles E  Schumer  D NY  in calling on New York Governor George Pataki and other Empire State legislative leaders to pass legislation providing full death benefits to the orphan of an NYPD detective who died from an illness directly related to his work at Ground Zero following 9 11  The senators said the legislation should allow   retroactive reclassification     which would pay full benefits to the beneficiaries of all those who die from injuries later linked to their work at Ground Zero  See more here
