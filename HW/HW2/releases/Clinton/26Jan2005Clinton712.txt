January 26  2005 Clinton Pushes For Prescription Drug Reimportation At First Aging Committee Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called for action on prescription drug reimportation  urging her colleagues to support bipartisan legislation to address this issue of critical importance to older Americans  The Senator  s comments came as she attended her first hearing in the 109th Congress of the Senate Special Committee on Aging          I am deeply concerned about skyrocketing prescription drug costs  and am eager to pass legislation to facilitate their safe reimportation   We have a good bipartisan bill which I am proud to be an original cosponsor of and I urge the leadership to speed its consideration by the Senate   Our seniors  many of whom are on fixed incomes  need relief as the price of medications is rising faster than inflation  consuming a larger and larger portion of their incomes     Senator Clinton said in her statement before the Committee          The increasing cost of these drugs means that many of our seniors face tough choices about their health  choices that no one should have to make  We ve all heard stories about seniors who try to stretch their dosages by splitting one pill over two days  or seniors who have to choose between buying food and getting a prescription filled  I think it s unconscionable that our health care system forces seniors to make these choices        We need to make drug reimportation safe  we need to make drug reimportation legal  and we need to do so as quickly as possible     Senator Clinton said in her statement        The bipartisan Dorgan Snowe reimportation legislation  of which Senator Clinton is a co sponsor  contains many provisions that will ensure safety while giving seniors access to cheaper drugs  The bill would allow seniors to safely access drugs from Canada starting 90 days after enactment   It would provide the needed authority and funding to the FDA to regulate foreign pharmacies and wholesalers  so that we can be sure that any drugs that enter the United States are safe for our seniors  And it will increase the consumer protections involved with internet pharmacies  so that seniors who don t live near the border can access imported drugs without being defrauded        The Senate Aging Committee  to which Senator Clinton was appointed late last year  has a strong history of calling the Congress   and the nation  s attention to issues affecting older Americans  The Committee was exploring health insurance coverage of older Americans prior to the enactment of Medicare in 1965   Since the passage of that legislation  the Committee has continually reviewed Medicare s performance on an almost annual basis  The Committee has also regularly reviewed pension coverage and employment opportunities for older Americans  It has conducted oversight of the administration of major programs like Social Security and the Older Americans Act and has crusaded against frauds targeting the elderly and Federal programs on which the elderly depend
