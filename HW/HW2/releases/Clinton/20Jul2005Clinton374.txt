July 20  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Kodak Announcement of Job Losses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The disappointing news of the additional layoffs today at Kodak is certainly a blow to the community  Our concern must be for the workers and their families who will be affected by this announcement  I understand that Kodak is creating partnerships with their  15 million economic development fund and is already working with some start up companies that have tremendous potential for growth  I hope Kodak can find the financial ground it needs on which to build for the future and utilize the tremendous entrepreneurial skills and talent of the Kodak workers in an effort to create new business enterprises and jobs in the area
