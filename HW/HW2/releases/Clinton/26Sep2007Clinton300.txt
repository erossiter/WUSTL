September 26  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Kyl Lieberman Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Earlier today  I voted for a non binding resolution that designates the Iranian Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization The Revolutionary Guards are deeply involved in Iran s nuclear program and have substantial links with Hezbollah   I voted for this resolution in order to apply greater diplomatic pressure on Iran  This resolution in no way authorizes or sanctions military action against Iran and instead seeks to end the Bush Administration s diplomatic inaction in the region   Iran has gained expanded influence in Iraq and the region as a result of the Bush Administration s polices which have also rejected diplomacy as a tool for addressing Iranian ambitions  While the United States has spurned talks  Iran has enhanced its nuclear enrichment capabilities  armed Iraqi Shiite militias  funneled arms to Hezbollah and subsidized Hamas  even as the government continues to damage its own citizens by mismanaging the economy and increasing political and social repression   I continue to support and advocate for a policy of entering into talks with Iran  because robust diplomacy is a prerequisite to achieving our aims    This legislation reaffirms my policy of engagement and refers specifically to the statement of Defense Secretary Gates who said that diplomatic and economic means are by far the preferable approach for dealing with the threat posed by Iran   In February  after troubling reports about the possibility of military action against Iran  I took to the Senate Floor to warn that President Bush needs Congressional Authorization before attacking Iran  Specifically  I said it would be a mistake of historical proportion if the Administration thought that the 2002 resolution authorizing force against Iraq was a blank check for the use of force against Iran without further and explicit Congressional authorization  Nor should the President think that the 2001 resolution authorizing force after the terrorist attacks of 9 11  in any way  authorizes force against Iran  If the Administration believes that any use of force against Iran is necessary  the President must come to Congress to seek that authority   Nothing in this resolution changes that
