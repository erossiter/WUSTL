December 30  2005 Clinton Calls For Bush Administration Investigation and Congressional Hearing Into Misuse of Critical 9 11 Small Business Assistance Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senator calls on President to address mishandling of loans meant to help local businesses recover and calls for a Senate hearing into allegations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to act in the wake of the Small Business Administration  s  SBA  mishandling of the post 9 11 small business Supplemental Terrorist Activity Relief  STAR  loan program  In a letter to the President  Senator Clinton said she was incensed by recent news reports and a report by the SBA  s own Inspector General that critical loans that were supposed to help small businesses recover after September 11th appear to have gone to businesses that were not impacted by the attacks  In her letter  Senator Clinton called on the President to act immediately and compel the SBA to answer questions about the program and to outline an oversight plan to ensure that the misuse and mishandling of the STAR program is not repeated  In early September  when the allegations about misuse of the STAR program first surfaced  Senator Clinton wrote to SBA Administrator Hector Barreto outlining many of her concerns            I am particularly incensed by the finding included in the SBA  s Inspector General  s report that despite the fact that in the months following September 11th  while many New York businesses struggled to just to stay afloat    SBA undertook efforts to promote the program by advising lenders that virtually any small business qualified and assuring them that SBA would not second guess their justifications       Senator Clinton wrote in her letter to the President              It is clear that the SBA  s assurances to lenders that there would not be any review or questioning of their practices created a lax oversight environment that enabled the misuse of this program  The fact that the OIG could not even determine the eligibility of many STAR loan recipients due to lack of documentation is a direct result of the conditions created by the SBA through its mismanagement and apathy towards how this program was implemented     Senator Clinton wrote            While New York businesses coped each day with the challenge of being successful in the shadow of September 11th  it is troubling to know that many other businesses with questionable qualifications in parts of the country far removed from New York received STAR loans     the Senator said in her letter     This becomes even more troubling by the fact that many New York businesses may have been dissuaded from even applying for STAR loans given the burdensome collateral requirements imposed by lenders    What is clear is that the questions and findings raised in the OIG  s report need to be fully and substantively addressed by the SBA and its associated lending institutions             Senator Clinton also today called on her Senate colleagues Olympia Snowe and John Kerry to hold a hearing into the misuse of the STAR loan program  For a copy of her letter  click here   http   clinton senate gov documents news 12 30 2005 pdf         The full text of Senator Clinton  s letter to President Bush follows          The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington DC 20500         Mr  President            It is with great concern that I have been following the reports of the Small Business Administration  s mishandling of the Supplemental Terrorist Activity Relief loan program   Indeed  the recent findings of the SBA  s Office of Inspector General  OIG  regarding the administration of that program in the weeks and months following September 11th compel me to write to you regarding my deep concern over the complete lack of oversight and the indifference to the questions raised to the SBA  s Administrator regarding this program           Indeed  the economic turmoil throughout the country resulting from the attacks of September 11th was severe  but clearly the largest economic  physical and emotional impact from those attacks was in New York City and State   I was pleased and gratified that federal programs and assistance were put in place to help small businesses impacted by the attacks   Nevertheless  as you know  many small businesses  especially in New York  were overwhelmed by the new burdens of a post 9 11 environment           As you know the STAR loan program was ostensibly created to assist small businesses   adversely affected    by September 11th   But it is clear from news accounts and the SBA  s Inspector General  s report that much of this aid may have been disbursed to businesses that may not have been impacted by September 11th at all   Indeed it is telling that the report indicates that in the OIG  s review of businesses who received loans  only 4 7 percent of STAR loan recipients were even aware that they had received loans through the STAR program           I am particularly incensed by the finding included in the SBA  s Inspector General  s report that despite the fact that in the months following September 11th  while many New York businesses struggled to just to stay afloat    SBA undertook efforts to promote the program by advising lenders that virtually any small business qualified and assuring them that SBA would not second guess their justifications      It is clear that the SBA  s assurances to lenders that there would not be any review or questioning of their practices created a lax oversight environment that enabled the misuse of this program           The fact that the OIG could not even determine the eligibility of many STAR loan recipients due to lack of documentation is a direct result of the conditions created by the SBA through its mismanagement and apathy towards how this program was implemented   As the OIG  s report states    SBA did not implement adequate internal controls and oversight of the STAR loan program to ensure that only eligible borrowers obtained STAR loans             While New York businesses coped each day with the challenge of being successful in the shadow of September 11th  it is troubling to know that many other businesses with questionable qualifications in parts of the country far removed from New York received STAR loans   This becomes even more troubling by the fact that many New York businesses may have been dissuaded from even applying for STAR loans given the burdensome collateral requirements imposed by lenders    What is clear is that the questions and findings raised in the OIG  s report need to be fully and substantively addressed by the SBA and its associated lending institutions           I believe that there needs to be a full accounting of how this program was implemented because I fully and strongly support the SBA and its mission to provide assistance to our nation  s small businessmen and women who are critical to our economic growth   Given the vital role the federal government plays in any rebuilding or recovery effort  the American people need to know that their tax dollars are well accounted for and used properly    As we embark on the rebuilding and recovery process in the Gulf Coast  I believe it is important that all questions raised about the STAR program be adequately answered in order to dispel any cynicism or doubt on the critical mission of the SBA   With the pivotal role the SBA will play in the Gulf Coast  s recovery  we need to ensure that future recovery and relief programs like the STAR program will not be subject to the same conduct  At this time when the American people have every reason to question the Administration s preparedness for disasters due to the failures surrounding Katrina and other recent events  I would hope and urge that you examine the OIG s disturbing findings about the implementation of the STAR program and take steps to ensure that all federal disaster assistance programs help those they re intended for and meet basic standards of good governance          On September 9  2005 I wrote to Administrator Barreto outlining many of these concerns  but have still not received a response as of yet to my questions   Given the new facts outlined in the OIG  s report  I respectfully urge you to compel the SBA to not only address the questions and concerns raised about this program  but to give assurances and outline an oversight agenda which will ensure that the misuse and mishandling of the STAR program will not be repeated          Thank you for your attention to this issue Mr  President and I hope to discuss with you a course of action on this matter soon           Sincerely          Hillary Rodham Clinton
