Click here for audio of Senator Clinton s comments     Washington  DC   Today  Senator Charles E  Schumer  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  Congressman Michael R  McNulty  Governor Eliot Spitzer  County Legislature Chair Susan E  Savage and Mayor Brian U  Stratton today announced that after intensive negotiations  Bechtel has agreed to retain 130 employees at its existing facility in downtown Schenectady that was scheduled to close  Another 30 employees now located at Bechtel Plant Machinery  Inc   BPMI  will be offered the opportunity to interview for open positions at the Knolls Atomic Power Lab  KAPL  in nearby Niskayuna   Finally  it is expected that about 60 employees will retire while another 70 positions will most likely relocate to the Pittsburgh area   BPMI currently employs 290 in Schenectady            While the Schenectady facility will be downsized  the total number of jobs that will leave the Capital Region has been reduced to about 70    BPMI will plans to sign a long term lease for the Schenectady facility ensuring that Schenectady County will continue to play a major role in the Navy Nuclear program  BPMI will also benefit from the new agreement by retaining key program staff based in Schenectady and by realizing savings from a consolidation plan               Mayor Brian U  Stratton said  Because of the outstanding leadership and quick response from Senator Schumer  Senator Clinton  Congressman McNulty and Governor Spitzer  we were able to save 130 good paying jobs from leaving New York State  and keeping them in downtown Schenectady for good  Working together with the County  and with our Congressional delegation in Washington  we have pulled victory from the jaws of defeat   Indeed  when upstate New York stands together  nothing can stand in our way           Senator Charles E  Schumer said that   While every job loss truly hurts  there is no question that today we have achieved a significant success for Schenectady and all of the Capital Region  We snatched a victory from the jaws of defeat  There is no question that Schenectady is poised for growth and I look forward to continuing to lead this fight for years to come    This was a long  hard fought process  and I am proud of the deal we all struck  I especially want to single out Mayor Brian Stratton for his tenacity in this effort   My colleagues at the federal  state  and local levels and the business community here in Schenectady did an outstanding job and worked tirelessly to create an agreement that would keep Bechtel in the Capital Region           Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said   I am so glad that our hard work has resulted in a solution that benefits both our national defense and the local community  which was innovative in identifying solutions which enabled us to maintain Bechtel s technology and engineering base in Schenectady   As a member of the New York delegation and the Senate Armed Services Committee  I would like to thank Admiral Donald who saw the merits of our argument that Bechtel should stay in Schenectady   I applaud all of the parties for working hard to achieve a solution that is good for the Navy  Bechtel and Schenectady           Congressman Michael McNulty said  By working cooperatively  the City of Schenectady  State of New York and the Capital District Congressional Delegation have assured that Bechtel Plant Machinery  Inc  will continue to have a presence in Schenectady  This is a testament of the commitment to the Tech Valley from elected officials at every level of government in the Capital District  and to the business friendly environment in New York State  added McNulty          Patrick Foye  Co Chairman of the Empire State Development Corp  said  We were proud to have worked on behalf of Governor Spitzer and the state of New York in helping preserving these jobs  all of which represent exactly the types of high tech jobs we must fight to keep and encourage as we confront the challenges of the worldwide innovative economy           Susan E  Savage  Chair of the Schenectady County Legislature said   We are extremely grateful to Senators Schumer and Clinton  Congressman McNulty and Governor Spitzer for rallying to and leading the effort to save Bechtel jobs in Schenectady   By savings these positions  we are keeping more than  20 million in direct economic impact here in the Capital Region each year   This agreement keeps Schenectady County at the forefront of the Navy Nuclear Program   This sends a strong message that Schenectady County will continue to fight for every job as we diversify and expand our economy through our aggressive economic development program           Ray Gillen  Chair of Metroplex and Commissioner of Economic Development in Schenectady County said   While some wrote this facility off  we worked together as a community with our fantastic leadership team in Washington and in Albany to save critical tech jobs for Schenectady County and the rest of the Capital Region  In the process  we will create exciting new tech space that will help us bring new employers to Schenectady County            The remaining space at the Liberty Street complex will be marketed to tech companies and other companies looking for space in the region   BPMI  as part of the agreement with State and federal officials  will commit to trying to assist small businesses in the area          Empire State Development  ESD  will provide a  2 million grant to Metroplex to sub divide the space creating an engineering center for Bechtel and office space that is in move in condition for other employers interested in locating at the complex   ESD will also provide up a total of  1 million to help underwrite lease and operational costs             The agreement announced today with Bechtel will create a new technology center in downtown Schenectady that will be used to bring additional tech employment and jobs to Schenectady County  while retaining key Bechtel engineering jobs in the community            Metroplex is already pursuing several companies that might be interested in leasing space          Bechtel originally announced plans last October to shutdown the Schenectady facility maintaining only a small satellite office at the Knolls Atomic Power Lab with the remaining jobs being shifted to the Pittsburgh area            As a result of today s decision  Bechtel will operate facilities in Schenectady and at a new site to be leased in Monroeville  PA with similar lease terms and provisions as the Schenectady site
