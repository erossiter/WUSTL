November 1  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Reaction to President Bush  s Pandemic Flu Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The sad fact is that our nation is simply not prepared to handle a major flu outbreak  let alone a pandemic   Since 2000  we have experienced three shortages of seasonal influenza vaccine   While it is welcome news that the Administration is focused on vaccine research and stockpiling in the event of a pandemic flu  the question is    how will the Administration handle distribution and communications with a system that has failed to meet seasonal flu vaccine demands in three out of the last five years            The President s plan calls for us to develop credible distribution mechanisms and prioritize countermeasure allocation for at risk populations   We already prioritize allocation for seasonal flu vaccine  and yet we re still not able to get it to all the seniors who need it   We must establish a tracking system  like the one called for in the Influenza Vaccine Security Act I introduced earlier this year with Senator Pat Roberts  that would allow the federal government  working with state and local health departments  to track vaccine from the factory to the clinic so all Americans know where local vaccine supplies are  particularly when a pandemic hits          Last fall  s flu vaccine shortage should have been a wake up call to the problem we will have on our hands when a pandemic strikes if we fail to address this critical public health challenge   Confusion and even panic broke out in some communities with people scrambling to get vaccines  while supplies went unused and unaccounted for in other areas   We can only assume that similar confusion and panic will occur in the event of a pandemic flu if this Administration fails to take steps to fix our domestic public health delivery and communications system now   The fact is that this Administration has not supported necessary funding to repair our broken public health infrastructure  to enable our state and local health departments to not only combat the threat of pandemic influenza  but the real life conditions which they face every day   They need to step up to the plate and start supporting critical needs now          One positive step forward would be for the Administration to support our legislation to ensure that fundamental fixes are made to our vaccine delivery system so we are able to adequately handle seasonal flu vaccine needs  as well as a flu pandemic   If we are to be prepared for the worst  we need to take first things first   We need a system that works   This Administration needs to understand that in the case of the flu  an ounce of prevention is truly worth a pound of cure
