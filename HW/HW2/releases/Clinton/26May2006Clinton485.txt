May 26  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Nomination of General Michael Hayden to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        WASHINGTON  DC   The next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency faces great challenges in reforming and improving an agency that is critical to providing our nation with accurate and timely intelligence about the threats facing our nation   It needs a leader who will ensure the CIA gives policymakers and Congress unvarnished analysis and advice and reinvigorates an agency that has suffered from politicization   The CIA director should also show respect for the rule of law and recognition of the oversight role of Congress   With the threats that our nation faces  we should expect no less            General Michael Hayden has had a distinguished career serving our nation  both in the military and as a leader in the intelligence community   However  I believe there are unanswered questions about whether he will exercise the independence and judgment necessary to be an effective CIA director in an Administration that has rejected contrary views          Recent reports have cast grave doubts on the Administration  s commitment to our rule of law and willingness to subject itself to Congressional oversight   Several months ago press reports disclosed that the National Security Agency has been secretly conducting a multi year program to eavesdrop on the calls of thousands of United States citizens living in the U S   As Director of the NSA  General Hayden oversaw the conceptualization  creation  and implementation of this program   More recently  it was reported that the NSA has also been collecting the phone records of tens of millions of U S  citizens   In my view  the Administration still has not provided adequate answers to Congress about these programs and has stonewalled Congress  s efforts to exercise its oversight role          In his public defense of the NSA  s domestic surveillance program  General Hayden excused the Administration  s decision to withhold from the full congressional intelligence committees legally mandated information that would have allowed Congress to properly evaluate the legal grounds for the program   During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week  General Hayden continued to assert that the President possesses inherent authority to override the law and to thwart meaningful Congressional oversight of such programs           At this critical juncture in our nation  s history  we need a CIA director who will exercise independence and not yield to the Administration  one who will be accountable and submit to the oversight of Congress when necessary   While General Hayden is a man of impressive credentials  he has not demonstrated a willingness to adhere to these principles   Since I expect him to be confirmed  I hope that he allays my concerns and provides the CIA with the kind of responsible leadership the CIA deserves and demands   But because I am not convinced he will do so  I cannot support his nomination
