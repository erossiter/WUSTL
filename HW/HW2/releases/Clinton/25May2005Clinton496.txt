                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Today Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Susan Collins  ME  and Representatives Patrick Kennedy  RI  and Ileana Ros Lehtinen  FL  announced the introduction of the Positive Aging Act of 2005 to improve access to mental health services for our nation s seniors  The bill introduction comes during Mental Health and Aging Week of National Mental Health Month        The Positive Aging Act of 2005 is designed to provide mental health care services in communities where seniors live  while taking steps toward integrating them with other essential health care services  All too often  seniors are unable to access adequate mental health care in their communities  even when they have access to other health care services in places like local community centers          In New York  there are two and a half million citizens aged 65 or older  and that population is only expected to grow  We must make sure that our nation s seniors have access to needed services by fully integrating mental health screening and treatment with other health services   Senator Clinton said          The mental health needs of older Americans are often overlooked or not recognized  This is particularly disturbing considering that one in five Americans aged 65 and older    including more than 32 000 Mainers    suffer from mental illness  This bill will help to promote the mental health and well being of our older citizens  It is an investment that will return tremendous dividends in terms of improved quality of life  better patient outcomes  and more efficient use of health care dollars   Senator Collins said         We can effectively treat many of the mental disorders common in older Americans  but to do this mental health screening must be a key component of primary care services for seniors   said Congressman Kennedy   Missed opportunities to diagnose and treat mental diseases continues to take a huge toll on the elderly  increasing the burden on their families and our health care system  Not only do we owe our seniors dignity and good health  but providing quality mental health care to older Americans that is also easily accessible  is just simply good policy   added Congressman Kennedy         The significance of this legislation cannot be underestimated  I realize the profound impact that access to quality mental healthcare has on our seniors  I believe that such a bill is not only beneficial  but it is also necessary for ensuring that our seniors have access to the mental healthcare they need in order to live a productive life   said Congresswoman Ros Lehtinen          Specifically  the legislation will provide grant funding through the Administration on Aging  which can be used for mental health screening and treatment services for older Americans  Areas that are underserved and include significant numbers of older adults will be given priority  In addition  the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration will be authorized to fund projects to provide collaborative mental health services in community settings where older adults reside and receive services         Senators Clinton and Collins and Representatives Kennedy and Ros Lehtinen first introduced the Positive Aging Act last Congress  More than 30 organizations have endorsed this legislation including the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry  American Psychological Association  National Association of Social Workers  and the Older Women s League  among others        Supporters of the   Positive Aging Act of 2005  S
