                                                                                                                                                                                                                        SCHENECTADY  NY    During a tour of the historic Proctor  s Theatre today  U S  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  announced that Proctor  s has been deemed eligible for historic tax credits from the United States Department of the Interior National Park Service and the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives Program  one of the nation  s most successful and cost effective community revitalization programs        Proctor  s Theatre was seeking eligibility for the historic tax credits in conjunction with the capital campaign for the  22 5 million expansion project which includes the enlarging of the main stage  the creation of a 450 seat IWERKS wide format film theatre  retail space  banquet space and an enlarged Box Office   Receiving this designation from the Federal Government allows Proctor  s to collect the net dollars of the sale of the tax credits  estimated to be worth as much as  2 5 million  which will be applied toward the  22 5 million project   With these credits  over  19 million will have been raised toward the project costs          This is incredible news for Proctor  s Theatre  So many people in Schenectady have already gotten behind the  22 5 million renovation project and these tax credits  which could be worth as much as  2 5 million  will take us even closer to that fundraising goal     said Senator Clinton  who helped Proctor s Theatre secure the credits    This is a tremendous boost for a project that holds so much promise  not only for the theatre  but for the city  This theatre    in all its beauty    truly represents the rebirth of Schenectady and I am pleased to be a partner with so many people in these expansion efforts           Mayor of Schenectady Brian U  Stratton said    Proctor  s expansion into a world class entertainment destination is  without question  the driving force behind the economic renaissance in downtown Schenectady   Senator Clinton has given Schenectady  s future a major boost in helping us to secure these important federal tax credits   Upstate cities like Schenectady are grateful and extremely fortunate to have Senator Clinton fighting to bring us our fair share from Washington           Proctor  s Board President  Rick Carlstrom stated    We especially appreciate the support and advice of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff   As on many occasions in the past  many people have come together to support Proctor  s efforts as a regional entertainment center         To become eligible for the Historic Tax Credits  the process begins by submitting the Historic Preservation Certification application to the State Historic Preservation Office  which then forwards the application to the National Park Service   The application is then reviewed to determine if it meets basic eligibility requirements in order to receive the tax credits  is consistent with the historic character of the property and meets all of the Secretary of the Interior  s Standards for Rehabilitation        Initially  Proctor  s Theatre was denied eligibility   Senator Clinton assisted with Proctor s appeal  along with United States Congressmen Michael McNulty and John Sweeney  Mayor of Schenectady  Brian U  Stratton  Don Ritter  Schenectady County Historian  Jay Musler  Fritz Liss  staff at Proctor  s Theatre and the resources of the City of Schenectady History Center   Also critical was the support of the League of Historic American Theatre and the Proctor  s Board of Directors who encouraged the theatre to appeal        Jointly managed by the National Park Service and the Internal Revenue Service in partnership with State Historic Preservation Offices  the Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program rewards private investment in rehabilitating historic buildings through financial incentives  Prior to the program  the U S  tax code favored the demolition of older buildings over saving and using them         Starting in 1976  the Federal tax code became aligned with national historic preservation policy to encourage voluntary  private sector investment in preserving historic buildings such as  abandoned or under used historic schools  warehouses  factories  churches  retail stores  apartments  hotels and offices   The program also provides a strong alternative to government ownership and management of such historic properties          The Historic Preservation Tax Incentives have proven an invaluable tool in revitalizing communities and preserving the historic places that give cities  towns  and rural areas their special character  The incentives generate jobs  both during the construction phase and in the spin off effects of increased earning and consumption  Rehabilitation of historic buildings attracts new private investment to the historic core of cities and towns and is crucial to the long term economic health of many communities  Enhanced property values generated by the Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program result in augmented revenues for local and state government through increased property  business  and income taxes  Historic Preservation Tax Incentives also create moderate and low income housing in historic buildings        Many other theatres around the United States  such as the Tennessee Theatre in Knoxville and the Ohio Theatre in Cleveland  have been granted eligibility for historic tax credits for their rehabilitation projects          For further information on the Historic Tax Credits  visit    INCENTIVES  A Guide To The Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives
