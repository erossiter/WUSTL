December 15  2006 Senator Clinton Reiterates Concerns Over   Passport Card    Planned for U S  Residents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Clinton Concerned that the Plan  s Potentially Severe Economic Impact and Serious Data Security and Privacy Concerns Have Not Been Taken Into Consideration    In Detailed Submission to the Department Of State  Senator Calls for a Full Economic Impact Study and an Assessment of Data Security and Privacy Concerns with the Proposal Before Any Further Decisions are Made                              Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton continued to express her concerns today over the Administration  s proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  including the card format passport or   passport card      In a long and full submission to the Department of State today  Senator Clinton said the Administration  s position on the card has   begun to strain credulity    and she seriously questioned its failure to consider the economic impact of the initiative or the data security and privacy concerns it poses to local residents along New York  s Northern Border       Click here to access a complete copy of Senator Clinton  s submission         The proposed rule is a matter of tremendous importance to my constituents in New York  as well as all Americans who live along the northern border   The security of our nation and its borders must be our greatest priority   However  in imposing new travel restrictions at the border  we must remain sensitive to the profound economic and social impact new restrictions can have on border communities   There is tremendous and legitimate concern that the Initiative would not only devastate the tourism and retail industry  but also greatly disrupt life on both sides of the American Canadian border   The notice of proposed rulemaking appears to largely neglect these concerns     Senator Clinton said in her submission today              The passport card as described in the notice of proposed rulemaking poses several problems   At the root of these problems are the card  s cost and the burden it would impose on U S  citizen travelers   The card would cost a total of  45 for an adult and  35 for a child  a burdensome cost that could prove prohibitive for many families who live in our border communities   In addition to cost  the proposal imposes several hurdles to attaining the passport card   State will issue and adjudicate the passport card in a manner similar to traditional passports   The notice does not mandate a specific turn around time for an application for a passport card  saying only that it would be the same as for a passport  which is roughly four to six weeks   No exception is allowed for the elderly or groups of minors on trips   No provision is made for day passes or those who appear at a border crossing without the proper documentation     Senator Clinton continued                Given the considerable evidence that the WHTI would have a dramatic and negative effect on the economies of border communities  it is troubling that State and DHS still have not conducted a review of the economic impact of the Initiative  and have not completed a single cost benefit analysis of their proposed passport card requirement and potential alternatives   In fact  in the notice of proposed rulemaking  State continues to take the position that a passport card rule is not an   economically significant regulatory action     that the rule is   not likely to have an annual effect on the economy of  100 million or more or to adversely affect in a material way the economy       or State  local  or tribal governments or communities     and therefore no rigorous cost benefit analysis is necessary under the law at all            This position has begun to strain credulity   Even setting to one side the overwhelming evidence that the Initiative will have a dramatic annual impact on the economy of border states  State itself estimates that 6 8 million  or about 51 percent  of U S  citizens who visited Canada in 2005 did not possess a passport   Even if only a fraction of those individuals were to purchase a passport card in a given year  the sale of the card itself would have an economic impact of more than  100 million in that year   Of course  if most of these individuals choose not to purchase the necessary documents to cross the border  the impact on cross border trade will be even more significant            The Government Accountability Office concluded earlier this year that DHS and State had yet to make many key programmatic and technical decisions regarding the Initiative  that the remaining issues present numerous challenges  and that DHS has not requested any funds to implement the Initiative in 2007   Congress has given the Administration an extra year and a half in order to implement new border crossing rules with care   Once again  in the strongest possible terms  I urge the Administration to use the additional time to perform a rigorous and comprehensive analysis of the costs and benefits of the Initiative and the passport card requirement  with an emphasis on the impact the requirements would have on the economies of our border communities  and a careful review of alternatives   The stakes are far too high for the Administration to continue to march forward in the dark on this important issue without any understanding of the economic consequences of its proposed plan     the Senator continued          Senator Clinton also pointed out that many of her constituents are concerned about the security of the information that would be contained on the card     The notice announces that the proposed passport card would use   vicinity read    radio frequency identification  RFID  technology   However  State and DHS do not appear to have tested this technology for use in a personal ID card  and a number of industry and privacy groups have voiced serious concerns that the RFID technology gives rise to several privacy and security concerns and that other options are preferable   Border identification requirements will not be successful unless people are confident that their personal information is secure   I urge State and DHS to give careful consideration to concerns that it has chosen the wrong technology for its program     the Senator said
