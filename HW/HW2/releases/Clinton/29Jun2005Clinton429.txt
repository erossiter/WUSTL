June 29  2005 With EPA Reviewing Regs on Human Pesticide Testing  Senator Clinton Applauds Passage of Amendment to Ban Testing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    Senator Clinton today applauded Senate passage of a bipartisan measure that she co sponsored to prevent testing of pesticides on humans  The amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from either funding or using studies in which humans are intentionally dosed with pesticides        Senator Clinton underscored that today s vote took on new urgency with news reports that the EPA is on the verge of issuing regulations that would open the flood gates for new EPA sponsored studies involving human pesticide testing  including studies on children  pregnant women and newborns         In disregarding standards for human testing  the EPA is putting our children at risk   said Senator Clinton   I am proud that the Senate agreed today that we need to put the brakes on this dangerous course  The Environmental Protection Agency must conduct and rely on safe  ethical tests to protect both the subjects of the tests and the integrity of the pesticide safety standards that protect our children         The anticipated EPA regulation is just the latest attempt by the Bush administration to weaken pesticide safety standards  At the urging of the pesticide industry  the EPA reversed a moratorium on evaluating studies in which humans are intentionally dosed with pesticides  Currently  the EPA is reviewing more than 20 human pesticide studies  many of which the National Academy of Sciences has determined violate accepted ethical standards  In fact  the National Academy of Science has found EPA pesticide studies in gross violation of ethical standards set out in the Nuremburg Code  the Declaration of Helsinki and the  Common Rule  that guides medical research in the United States         Earlier this year  the House of Representatives approved an identical amendment underscoring support for this action
