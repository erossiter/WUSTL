October 25  2005 Senator Clinton Meets With NRC Chairman Diaz Over Indian Point  Secures Commitment to Stronger Oversight of Nuclear Facility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton met today with U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  Chairman Nils Diaz to personally discuss recent leaks found near the spent fuel pools at the Indian Point power plant  as well as continued problems associated with the plant  s emergency notification system  During the meeting  the Senator called on the NRC to produce a comprehensive plan and timeline for dealing with these serious issues facing the facility              I had a good meeting with the Chairman today  and expressed my serious concerns over the recent leak of radioactive water and the continued failure of the plant  s emergency notification systems     Senator Clinton said    People living around the plant have a right to know about how this leak happened and what action is being taken  not only to identify the source of the problem  but to determine what the impact might be              During the meeting  Chairman Diaz informed Senator Clinton that he would soon announce enhanced oversight of Indian Point with respect to both the leaks and the emergency notification system   In addition  Chairman Diaz committed that the NRC would be implementing the provision Senator Clinton inserted in the energy bill by issuing detailed orders to Entergy in January to require them to back up their emergency notification system             Enhanced oversight is a very important step in dealing with the problems at Indian Point  and I welcome the Chairman  s commitment to increasing his agency  s role  However  I remain concerned about the lack of a comprehensive plan to deal with the problems the facility is facing and call on the NRC to produce a multi agency timeline as soon as possible             At the meeting  Senator Clinton presented Chairman Diaz with a letter outlining her concerns   The text of the letter follows          October 25  2005       The Honorable Nils J  Diaz  Ph D   Chairman  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Washington  D C   20555         Dear Dr  Diaz          Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss several issues of concern related to the Indian Point nuclear power plant            I requested the meeting on September 21st  when the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  announced that a leak from one of the spent fuel pools at Indian Point had been discovered weeks earlier   At that time  I stated that the people who live near the plant deserve answers about what happened  whether they are safe  and why they were not told about the problem sooner   In the month since that initial disclosure  some of these questions have been answered  some remain  and new ones have arisen            My greatest concern about the leaks is that they pose a potential threat to groundwater and drinking water   Last week  Entergy announced several steps it is taking to address the situation  eight more wells will be drilled around Indian Point 2 next month  the liner of the spent fuel pool will be inspected  starting in the next several weeks  and a mitigation plan will be developed within the next two months   These steps are welcome  but do not comprise a comprehensive plan   I would like your office to provide me as soon as possible with a detailed timeline of how the types  rates  and sources of all of the leaks will be identified  tracked and mitigated   I am particularly concerned that a sufficient number of wells be drilled to enable a full assessment of the extent of contamination   I would also like clarification of the role of the Department of Environmental Conservation  DEC  and the New York State Department of Health as well as other agencies in the testing process             I am also concerned about your public notification procedure  noting that it was several weeks following the leak before the details of the leak became available  I would like your office to provide me as soon as possible with a detailed plan for notification of community and elected officials should any future incidents occur          In addition  I remain concerned about continued failures of the emergency notification system   Last week  10 of 16 Indian Point sirens in Orange County failed to function properly when tested on a back up radio transmission   This latest problem follows several malfunctions of the system over the summer during power outages   As you know  I authored a provision in the energy bill to require the NRC to require installation of backup power for the Indian Point sirens within 18 months   While this provision was in its final stages of approval  Entergy announced that it planned to install backup power for the sirens   While I welcomed that announcement  I am now concerned that the issue is not receiving timely attention   Given the continuing failures of the system  it is imperative that the NRC move as quickly as possible to require an effective backup system for the Indian Point emergency notification system   Please provide my office with a timeline for implementation as soon as possible          Thank you for your attention to these important matters   I look forward to your reply            Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
