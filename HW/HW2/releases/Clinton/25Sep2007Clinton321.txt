September 25  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Situation in Burma                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Over the last several days  tens of thousands of Buddhist monks and sympathizers have taken to the streets to call for freedom and democracy in Burma   The ruling military junta has committed numerous  well documented atrocities against the people of Burma   Systematic use of rape as a weapon of war  forced child labor  recruitment and use of child soldiers and human trafficking are all too routine   I stand in solidarity with the people of Burma and continue to support sanctions against the Burmese regime in order to pressure the regime to end human rights violations and restore the democratic government   I add my voice to those praising the courage and commitment of the demonstrators and echo their call for the immediate release of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners by the Burmese government  who have dedicated their lives to the peaceful  non violent movement for democracy and reconciliation   I hope that the Burmese Government will avoid violence and heed the wishes of the Burmese people for greater freedom
