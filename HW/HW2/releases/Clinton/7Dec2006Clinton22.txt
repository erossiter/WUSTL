December 7  2006 Senator Clinton Reiterates Call on Department of Homeland Security to Keep Buffalo Niagara in the Urban Area Security Initiative Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Decision Expected Soon from the Department of Homeland Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC    In anticipation of the Department of Homeland Security  s  DHS  release of grant guidelines later this month  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton again today reiterated her serious frustration with DHS  s plan to eliminate the Buffalo Niagara region from the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI  threat based funding program  In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff  Senator Clinton called on him to reject the   reckless    and   shortsighted    decision          Earlier this year  the DHS placed Buffalo Niagara on the list of UASI cities getting only   sustaining funds    for FY06  meaning that the region would be phased out of the UASI program after the current fiscal year  Senator Clinton has been very vocal in her opposition to this proposal  criticizing DHS last January when they initially announced their decision and calling on Secretary Chertoff last August to personally visit Buffalo so he can see for himself the unique threats faced by the region            As the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  prepares to announce guidelines for the FY 2007 Homeland Security Grant Program  HSGP   I want to again express my profound disappointment with DHS  s determination last year that the Buffalo Niagara region is to be phased out of the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI  threat based funding program  and reiterate my hope that you will use this year  s grant program to reconsider this shortsighted decision     Senator Clinton wrote in her letter to Secretary Chertoff today              The decision to phase Buffalo Niagara out of the UASI program demonstrates a complete lack of appreciation for the security threats facing the region     Senator Clinton  s letter continued     Removing the Buffalo Niagara region from the list of eligible UASI recipients shows a failure to understand and to appreciate the region  s exceptional vulnerabilities   I am certain that a careful examination of the threats faced by the Buffalo Niagara region will lead DHS to agree with me that the decision to phase out Buffalo Niagara from the UASI program is both shortsighted and does not serve the homeland security interests of either Western New York or our nation as a whole           A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter follows        December 6  2006      The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C  20528      Dear Mr  Secretary       As the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  prepares to announce guidelines for the FY 2007 Homeland Security Grant Program  HSGP   I want to again express my profound disappointment with DHS  s determination last year that the Buffalo Niagara region is to be phased out of the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI  threat based funding program  and reiterate my hope that you will use this year  s grant program to reconsider this shortsighted decision             As you know  this past January DHS made the reckless decision to remove the Buffalo Niagara region from the list of high threat regions eligible for future UASI funds  giving it only   sustaining    funds for FY 2006 so that it can complete current homeland security projects   The decision to phase Buffalo Niagara out of the UASI program demonstrates a complete lack of appreciation for the security threats facing the region                  In reaching its decision  DHS reportedly limited its examination to Buffalo and the 10 mile radius surrounding the city  a calculation that ignores the numerous threats facing the entire region   The calculation disregards much of the region  s critical infrastructure  including the Niagara Power Project  the region  s five international bridges  and the over 600 chemical and hazardous materials facilities in the area   It ignores the fact that the Buffalo Niagara region is one of our nation  s most traversed international crossings  serving not only as a gateway for tourists but also for those who would do us harm   Moreover  it means DHS failed to consider Niagara Falls  one of our nation  s most recognizable and visited attractions          Removing the Buffalo Niagara region from the list of eligible UASI recipients shows a failure to understand and to appreciate the region  s exceptional vulnerabilities   I am certain that a careful examination of the threats faced by the Buffalo Niagara region will lead DHS to agree with me that the decision to phase out Buffalo Niagara from the UASI program is both shortsighted and does not serve the homeland security interests of either Western New York or our nation as a whole            Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
