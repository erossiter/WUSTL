December 21  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Re  Discovery of More Radioactive Water At Indian Point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I am extremely concerned about news that more radioactive water has been found at the Indian Point site   While I was pleased when NRC Chairman Nils Diaz committed to me in November that he would increase oversight of Indian Point  the recent discovery of radioactive water reinforces my conviction that we must find the cause of these leaks and determine what is needed to mitigate their impact in the most expedient manner possible to protect public health and safety
