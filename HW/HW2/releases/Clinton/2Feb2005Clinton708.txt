February 2  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the undecided 35th State Senatorial District Election                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The right to vote and to have that vote counted is guaranteed both by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of New York State  As we watched Iraqis vote by paper ballots this past weekend  the importance of elective representation as one of the cornerstones of a democracy could not have been clearer  I will fight to ensure that elections are conducted fairly  at home as well as abroad  and to protect the will of the people from interference by a political party        All of the nearly 600 ballots that have yet to be counted in this race for the 35th Senatorial district were cast by voters who are eligible to vote in that district  It is unacceptable that voters should pay the price of having their votes discarded because poll workers gave voters paper ballots instead of directing the voters to their correct election districts  I urge the Court of Appeals to protect the rights of New York voters and require these ballots be opened
