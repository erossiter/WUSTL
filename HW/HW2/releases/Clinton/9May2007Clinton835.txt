May 9  2007 Senator Clinton Welcomes Senate Investigation of Refinery Outages and Inspection of Gas Prices                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Calls on Senate Committee to Examine the Cause of Refinery Shutdowns and Whether any Price Gouging is Taking Place when the Committee Holds a Hearing on Gas Prices on Tuesday   Says Oil Companies Should Fix their Damaged Refineries without Passing Cost on to Consumers   Underscores Need for Federal Government to Ensure Refineries are Maintained and Inspected                   Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to examine the cause of refinery shutdowns and whether any price gouging is taking place when the Committee holds a hearing on gas prices next Tuesday            In her letter to Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and Ranking Member Pete V  Domenici  Senator Clinton underscored that the oil companies themselves should be held responsible for their facilities and should not pass the cost of temporary shortages on to consumers            Pointing to recent high refining profits  Senator Clinton stated that refiners should use some of their billions of dollars in excess windfall profits to repair and maintain their refineries without passing on the cost   Senator Clinton also asked the Energy Committee to look at whether stronger inspection and maintenance rules are needed for refineries            Consumers simply cannot continue to absorb the crippling cost of these rising gas prices  I am very concerned that oil companies are not being held responsible for their own infrastructure and are being allowed to pass shortages on to consumers as price hikes  They should instead use some of their windfall profits to cushion the blow at the pump  I urge the Senate Energy committee to look closely at these issues when they convene hearings next Tuesday so we can get to the bottom of the price spike and take action   Senator Clinton said          A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below            The Honorable Jeff Bingaman  Chairman   Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  D 304  United States Senate  Washington  D C   20510      The Honorable Pete V  Domenici  Ranking Member  Committee on Energy and Natural Resources  D 304  United States Senate  Washington  D C   20510      Dear Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Domenici       I write to request that you look at several pressing issues when you convene the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources next Tuesday to hold hearings on the recent spike in gas prices           Under your leadership  the Senate Energy committee recently reported a bill that will help to make the United States less dependent on foreign oil in the coming years   I look forward to working with you on that legislation when it is brought before the Senate            As important as these long term measures are  we now face the immediate problem of record high gas prices   As you know  the nationwide average price for a gallon of regular gasoline broke  3 00 this week  and is predicted to stay at those levels for the duration of the summer            United States Department of Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman has stated that the temporary shutdown of several oil refineries has reduced refinery capacity and is responsible for the recent spike in prices   According to reports  U S  gasoline inventories have dropped 12 weeks in a row and are down about 15 percent since February   This reduction in capacity comes at a critical time  when many areas of the country are changing over from winter gasoline blends to summer gasoline blends            Many of my constituents are suspicious of the timing and cause of these refinery outages   When you convene the Committee next Tuesday  I urge you to examine the cause of these refinery outages and whether we need stronger inspections or other processes in place to ensure that refiners invest adequately in the maintenance of their facilities   We know that the outages are hurting consumers  but they do not appear to be hurting refiners   Recent reports have indicated that refining profits in the first quarter of 2007 increased 36 percent over last year  and the U S  refining margin increased to over  17 per barrel of oil refined             In addition  I ask that you examine whether any price gouging has occurred as a result of these unanticipated shortages   I am a supporter of legislation that would give federal and state regulators new authority to prosecute price gouging in the wake of national energy emergencies  as well as put in place measures to ban manipulation and enhance the transparency of our nation s fuel markets           I appreciate your consideration of this request  and look forward to working with you to act to protect American consumers from unwarranted price increases and to advance legislation to reduce our reliance on oil            Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
