June 29  2006 Senator Clinton Welcomes Key Senate Panel Approval of  1 7 Million for Long Island Sound Dredge Disposal Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed approval by the Senate Appropriations Committee of the Fiscal Year 2007 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill  which includes  1 7 million to begin work on a long term management plan for environmentally sound disposal of material dredged from the harbors around the Long Island Sound             This is an important step toward stopping the dumping in the Long Island Sound     said Senator Clinton    New York and Connecticut must work collaboratively to find better alternatives to simply dumping dredge material in the Sound  I m thrilled that the Army Corps of Engineers will now have the resources to begin working with the States to identify those alternatives             Development of the plan  known as the Dredge Material Management Plan  DMMP   is an important step towards reducing  and potentially eliminating  open water disposal of dredge material in the Long Island Sound           In March of 2004  the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  proposed to designate two sites in the Long Island Sound as disposal sites for dredge material for twenty years  Responding to environmental concerns about the EPA proposal  Clinton voiced her opposition  and introduced legislation to set up an alternative process  The bill required the development of a Dredge Material Management Plan that would govern disposal in the Sound  As part of that process  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA were to evaluate upland disposal options and dump only the cleanest dredge material as a matter of last resort           In May of 2005  the EPA announced a new proposal to address the concerns raised by Senator Clinton and the environmental community  The proposal established a new process to govern disposal in the Sound going forward  Components of that process include                Any disposal must receive authorization from the U S  Army Corps of Engineers and is subject to EPA review  Specifically  the dredged material must satisfy environmental impact criteria contained in existing regulations              Before dredge material is disposed at one of the open water sites  it must be determined that there are no practicable  environmentally preferable management options available  such as landfill disposal  beach nourishment  or treatment              Use of the sites will be curtailed if a Dredged Material Management Plan for Long Island Sound to help manage dredged materials in a cost effective and environmentally acceptable manner is not completed within 8 years              The disposal sites will be subject to new management and monitoring protocols to track site conditions and prevent environmental damage  If this monitoring shows unacceptable damage  EPA can close the sites
