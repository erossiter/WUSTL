June 29  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the United States India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Today  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved legislation intended to help pave the way for a future U S  India agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation   I intend to vote in support of this legislation when it comes to the Senate floor             The United States and India are bound together by deep mutual respect and our common efforts to work towards a democratic  free and secure world   As co chair of the Senate India Caucus  I have sought to strengthen the ties that bind our two nations             The legislation that emerged from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is a significant improvement over the implementing legislation put forward by the Administration in March   The Administration  s initial proposal sought to undercut Congressional authority by asking us to effectively approve an agreement before it had even been negotiated with India  and before India had reached its nuclear safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency  IAEA              I have been carefully following the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  s consideration of this agreement   Senator Richard Lugar  the Foreign Relations Committee Chairman and Senator Joseph Biden  the Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member  are to be commended for the seriousness with which they exercised their jurisdiction over this legislation   Because of the efforts of Chairman Lugar and Ranking Member Biden  the bill that was voted out of committee today is a far better bill    The legislation passed by the Foreign Relations Committee not only retains Congressional prerogatives  but it also ensures that Congress will not have to vote to approve a final agreement until every single nation in the Nuclear Suppliers Group  NSG   the global regime given the charge for ensuring the responsible trade of nuclear technology  has agreed to permit the transfer of peaceful nuclear technology to India   By working through the NSG  we will help strengthen both that group  as well as the greater international nonproliferation regime that is center stage as we address the threats posed by the nuclear weapons programs of Iran and North Korea            As India continues to grow stronger and to shoulder more of the responsibilities that come with being a leading nation in the world  we must continue to work towards greater cooperation with our Indian friends to deal with our common challenges in security  energy  economics and health   I hope that this agreement is just the first step on that journey that our countries  and our people  will take together
