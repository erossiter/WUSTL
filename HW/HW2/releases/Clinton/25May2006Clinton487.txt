May 25  2006 Statement of Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Patty Murray on Plan B Revelations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Patty Murray  WA  issued the following statement on depositions released in a suit against the FDA showing political leadership actively delayed a decision on making Plan B available over the counter            It is clear that our worst fears were true   Two successive FDA commissioners   Bush Administration political appointees    blocked Plan B from being sold over the counter  overruling the FDA  s medical experts  advisors and the recommendations of over 70 organizations  including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics   It is outrageous that under this Administration  an agency entrusted with making unbiased decisions based on science has abused its authority and allowed ideology to govern its decision making   The FDA should not be playing politics with the health of American women   The American people must be able to trust that the FDA is the gold standard in drug approval   Every day that goes by without a decision on Plan B is a threat to both women s health and the integrity of the FDA and we call on Acting Commissioner von Eschenbach to resolve this issue without further politics or delay
