July 12  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Nomination of Dr  James Holsinger for Surgeon General                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  The Surgeon General is charged with protecting and advancing the health of the nation through health promotion and disease prevention efforts and with articulating scientifically based health policy analysis and advice for the President and the Secretary of Health and Human Services   In addition  the Surgeon General is supposed to elevate the quality of public health practice by advancing appropriate standards in the professional disciplines   I have grave concerns about the ability of Dr  Holsinger to fulfill these duties    A quarter century after the AIDS epidemic first appeared in our country  there is still stigma and ignorance about HIV   We need  as our nations chief health educator  someone who will be able to provide unbiased and accurate information about prevention and treatment  Several of the comments Dr  Holsinger has made about homosexuality raise doubts about his ability to be effective in this role as chief health educator  especially if the American people cannot rely on him as a source of unbiased scientific information   Many of our nations HIV and AIDS groups  including the New York AIDS Coalition  have stated their opposition to Dr  Holsinger because of these comments   If there is distrust between those who are on the front lines of our prevention efforts and the lead prevention advocate of our federal government  I fear that it will set back our efforts to prevent the more than 40 000 new HIV infections we face annually     I am also concerned about Dr  Holsingers management record while serving as Chief Medical Director for the Veterans Health Administration   During his tenure  the General Accounting Office released a report documenting several cases where patients died because of substandard care at the VA   Further  during his tenure as Kentuckys Secretary for the Cabinet and Family Services  Dr  Holsinger failed to adequately address problems at a state institution for individuals with developmental disabilities  leading the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to notify the facility that it would be cutting off Medicaid funds due to lack of compliance with federal regulations      This experience does not bode well for the ability of Dr  Holsinger to elevate the quality and standards of public health practice in our nation   Indeed  leading public health advocacy organizations  including the American Public Health Association and the Society for Public Health Education  have stated their opposition to Dr  Holsingers nomination    At a time when we have so many pressing public health issues facing us  it is critical we have someone who will inspire confidence among patients  providers and the public  Because of the questions that have been raised about Dr  Holsingers qualifications and ability to fulfill the duties of the job  I do not believe that he will be able to provide adequate leadership in the public health field as Surgeon General  and I must go on the record as opposing his nomination
