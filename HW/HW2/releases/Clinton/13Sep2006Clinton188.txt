September 13  2006 Senator Clinton Urges VA Secretary to Commit to Keeping Canandaigua VAMC Open                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Community concerned about lack of communication from federal officials while VA Secretary announces that other New York facilities will remain open   Clinton reiterates call for VA Secretary to heed the recommendations of CARES report and keep Canandaigua facility open                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Amidst continuing community concern  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on Veterans   Affairs  VA  Secretary Jim Nicholson to provide an immediate update on the status of the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  VAMC    In a letter to Secretary Nicholson  Senator Clinton notes that the Secretary has begun to make announcements about other VA facilities around the state and says she hopes that he will soon make a similar announcement about Canandaigua  During her recent visit to Canandaigua  Senator Clinton heard directly from local leaders who continue to be concerned about the lack of information that has been forthcoming on the VA  s decision            It has been over a year since the last Local Advisory Panel Meeting regarding the future of the Canandaigua VA and no clear indications have been given to the community about a timetable for a decision or about the decision itself  The VA still has not given any indication as to which plan they prefer out of the eight that were submitted and while the community appreciates the designation of the facility as a Center for Excellence  it remains unknown what  if any  impact this will have on the final decision     said Senator Clinton following the release of her letter          In her letter to Secretary Nicholson  Senator Clinton reiterates her concern that the voices of New York veterans directly affected by his decisions had not been sufficiently heard   The Senator also calls on the Secretary to heed the 2004 recommendations of the VA s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  process and the views of the Canandaigua Local Advisory Panel to retain the critical veterans  health care services provided by the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  VAMC             I urge Secretary Nicholson to give the CARES mandate and the concerns of the Local Advisory Panel his full consideration when coming to a decision about the future of the Canandaigua VA Medical Center   I hope Secretary Nicholson uses this opportunity to reaffirm the 2004 CARES Commission decision recommendation  which called for maintaining VA facilities in Canandaigua  including nursing home  domiciliary and residential rehabilitation  gero psychiatric services and hospice care   I look forward to continuing to work with the Department of Veterans Affairs on behalf of veterans in New York and around the Nation who are depending on us to keep the commitment we have made to them     said Senator Clinton            The 2004 CARES decision for Canandaigua indicated that            The facility should remain open          The Master Plan will include construction of a new multi specialty outpatient clinic and nursing home complex to replace the patient care facilities currently located on the Canandaigua campus          The new nursing home complex will accommodate nursing home  domiciliary and residential rehabilitation patients and will provide gero psychiatric services and hospice care          These new facilities will ensure that Canandaigua veterans are treated in modern  state of the art facilities designed for provision of quality health care and built to more effectively meet their needs  and         The new facilities will remain in Canandaigua and be incorporated into the Master Plan          A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter is attached       The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary  United States Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20420    Dear Mr  Secretary     I write with great interest regarding the current status of the Canandaigua VA Medical Center  VAMC  within the CARES process   Given your recent and welcome decision to retain the existing VAMC  s in Manhattan and Brooklyn  I am hopeful that there will be a similar outcome for the facilities in Canandaigua   As you know  the Canandaigua VAMC has provided superb health care to veterans in Central New York since the 1930  s            In May 2004  the CARES decision for Canandaigua indicated that the facility should remain open   Specifically  it stated    The Master Plan will include construction of a new multi specialty outpatient clinic and nursing home complex to replace the patient care facilities currently located on the Canandaigua campus   The new nursing home complex will accommodate nursing home  domiciliary and residential rehabilitation patients and will provide gero psychiatric services and hospice care   These new facilities will ensure that Canandaigua veterans are treated in modern  state of the art facilities designed for provision of quality health care and built to more effectively meet their needs   The new facilities will remain in Canandaigua and be incorporated into the Master Plan             In August 2005  the Local Advisory Panel heard eight business plan options for the future of the Canandaigua campus   All eight recommended maintaining facilities in Canandaigua    none called for closure   Unfortunately  no further Local Advisory Panel meetings have occurred since last August  In April of this year  amid concerns that the VA was not fully engaging the Local Advisory Panel and New York veterans vested in the future of Canandaigua  I asked that you ensure that their views and recommendations would be considered as part of the CARES process   Additionally  I was concerned that the needs of our newest veterans were not being thoroughly evaluated and accounted for in your final recommendations   In your response of May 19  2006  you stated that Stage 1 was complete  but that   the LAP and stakeholders will have an opportunity to review the Stage 2 analysis    and make recommendations    prior to final decision               Since you have already begun to announce the disposition of sites under the CARES process  I urge you to give the CARES mandate and the concerns of the Local Advisory Panel your full consideration when coming to a decision about the future of the Canandaigua VAMC   I also request that you reaffirm the 2004 CARES Commission decision recommendation regarding Canandaigua as which called for maintaining VA facilities there including nursing home  domiciliary and residential rehabilitation  gero psychiatric services and hospice care   I look forward to an update on the future of these facilities and to working with you on behalf of veterans in New York and around this Nation who are depending on us to keep the commitment our Nation has made to them               Sincerely yours     Hillary Rodham Clinton
