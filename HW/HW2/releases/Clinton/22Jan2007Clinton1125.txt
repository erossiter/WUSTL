                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Senators  Reps  and Responders Call for More Treatment   in President s Budget  Plan to Treat and Monitor 9 11 Ill     Current Treatment Funds Will Run Out this Summer  Funds for 2008 Nonexistent New York  NY   Today  Senator Charles Schumer  D NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Congresswoman Carolyn B  Maloney  D Manhattan  Queens   Congressman Vito Fossella  R Staten Island  Brooklyn  and Congressman Jerrold Nadler  D Manhattan  Brooklyn  gathered at Ground Zero with a group of 9 11 responders  family members and others who will be attending tomorrow s State of the Union Address           Those heading to Washington include John Sferazo and Marvin Bethea of the Unsung Heroes Helping Heroes Foundation  Joseph  Linda and Tylerann Zadroga  the father  mother and daughter of 9 11 responder James Zadroga  who died last year of an illness caused by 9 11  Ceasar Borja  Jr   the son of retired NYPD officer and 9 11 responder Ceasar Borja  who is in need of a lung transplant  and Robert Gulack  a Manhattan office worker suffering lung damage because of exposure to World Trade Center debris          With the first and only dose of federal funds for 9 11 health treatment running out  the elected officials and responders called on President Bush to include ample 9 11 health funding  both for this year and for 2008  in his upcoming budget proposal   The participants also requested that the Bush Administration develop a comprehensive plan to monitor everyone exposed to Ground Zero toxins and treat anyone who is sick as a result            The administration needs to do the right thing for those who have given so much   Senator Schumer said   It is time for the Administration to step up and provide adequate funding for monitoring and treatment for the 9 11 workers in the President s FY 08 budget            These first responders  volunteers and their families are living proof of our very real need to provide for their medical treatment  now and in the future  I hope that as the President presents the State of the Union on Tuesday night  he acknowledges their situation and provides the funding in the upcoming budget that is needed to take care of these brave and selfless people who never questioned their responsibility on 9 11 and are now paying a terrible price   Senator Clinton said           The President must act now or 9 11 health clinics are going to get foreclosure notices   said Rep  Maloney    We cannot let that happen   More responders should not have to die before we finally do right by the heroes of 9 11   It is well past time for 9 11 responders and lower Manhattan residents to get the care they need and deserve           Rep  Fossella said   We have made progress over the last year to begin getting the resources necessary to help our 9 11 heroes  However  we now need a significant investment by the federal government into health monitoring and treatment for those who are sick or injured  In addition  the federal government must develop a comprehensive plan to address the health impacts of 9 11  We continue urging the White House to provide adequate funding in the 2008 budget to help all those who are sick or injured as a result of the terror attacks            The Federal  State  and City governments are clearly culpable for recklessly allowing thousands of people to be exposed to environmental toxins in the days following 9 11   said Rep  Nadler    And yet  we are seeing 9 11 victims struggling to pay health care costs with inadequate or no insurance  a horrendous number of worker s compensation claims rejected  and a government still failing to test and clean up apartments  workspaces and schools  which would prevent more people from getting sick           Senators Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Reps  Maloney  Nadler  and Maurice Hinchey gave their gallery passes to the State of the Union to the responders  who will highlight the urgent need for additional federal funding for 9 11 health treatment and monitoring           In a meeting with NY elected officials last month  the Bush Administration appointees responsible for directing the federal government s 9 11 health policy were informed that health treatment programs that have received federal funding will likely run out of money and be forced to close their doors as early as this summer   More than 32 000 people are registered in the two major treatment programs  operated by Mt  Sinai Hospital and the New York City Fire Department          Read more statements and remarks by Senator Clinton concerning the lasting health effects of 9 11
