March 11  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Settlement of the Holocaust Survivors  Gold Train Case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I am so pleased by the news that the Justice Department has finally settled the case of the Hungarian Gold Train brought by Hungarian Holocaust survivors  achieving the resolution deserved by thousands of survivors  Over the course of the last year I have urged the Administration to act on this pressing issue  including a letter I sent last May with Senator Arlen Specter and 15 additional Senators to Attorney General Ashcroft calling for immediate action  we have tried to achieve the resolution deserved by the survivors who were literally dying as their case languished  While nothing can heal the wounds suffered by many of these survivors  I am grateful and relieved that our government is providing long overdue redress to these aging men and women         For the past year  Senator Clinton has worked hard to push for a resolution in the Gold Train case  In March of 2004  Senator Clinton wrote to Attorney General John Ashcroft to ask for immediate action on the  Gold Train  case  amid reports that officials at the United States Department of Justice were  dragging their feet  on resolving the matter  In May  Senator Clinton joined with Sen  Arlen Specter  R PA   and several of her Senate colleagues in a bipartisan letter calling on the Attorney General to solve the matter with survivors  In October  Senator Clinton issued a statement before the Senate urging the Justice Department to end  half a century of silence and cover up  and provide these survivors with the adequate compensation they deserve        In May of 1945  a train laden with valuables that had been seized from Hungarian Jews by the Nazis was turned over to US forces  Unfortunately  the United States maintained that the origin of the valuables was  unidentifiable  and the train s contents were never returned to their owners  According to the U S  Commission on Holocaust Assets  the Gold Train was an  egregious failure  of the United States to follow its own policy regarding restitution of property after World War II  Over a thousand New Yorkers and other Americans who faced Nazi cruelty and fled oppressive forces during or after World War II were waiting for justice for the mishandling of their property from the so called  gold train
