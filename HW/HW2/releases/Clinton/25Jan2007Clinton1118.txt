January 25  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Port Authority  s Authorization of the Purchase of the Operating Lease at Stewart International Airport                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Port Authority s decision to purchase Stewart Airport is a significant milestone and a very positive step for Stewart as it continues to create more travel opportunities for the region  The Port Authority s purchase of the Stewart lease will not only relieve some pressure on our other major airports  it is a major economic and commercial investment in the Hudson Valley  I applaud Governor Spitzer s decision to support this proposal  I have long seen the value in Stewart Airport as a major gateway to New York and I am pleased that the efforts of the entire community to promote its potential are paying off
