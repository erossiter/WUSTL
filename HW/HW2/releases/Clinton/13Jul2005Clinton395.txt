July 13  2005 Lieberman  Clinton  Nelson  Reed  Tauscher  Udall Introduce Legislation to Increase U S  Troop Strength by 80 000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    With the United States Army straining to meet its current obligations and the National Guard and Reserves stretched to the limit  Senators Joseph Lieberman  Hillary Rodham Clinton  Bill Nelson and Jack Reed and Representatives Ellen Tauscher and Mark Udall today announced that they will introduce legislation to significantly increase the Army  s baseline troop strength   The United States Army Relief Act will boost the overall troop levels authorized by Congress by 20 000 active duty members per year over the next four years  giving the Army the breathing room to reduce the overburden on our active duty troops as well as our Guard and Reserve and rebuild our capacity to respond to future threats             The United States Army is facing a crisis today     Senator Lieberman said     It is not a crisis of quality  bravery or commitment  Our Army is a magnificent force and the men and women in today  s Army are as good as any who have ever worn the uniform   The crisis is there simply are not enough of them                To protect our country in the post 9 11 world  we need an Army large enough to respond to threats wherever danger lies  but the strain on our Army and our over reliance on our Guard and Reserves are pushing our capacity to the breaking point     said Senator Clinton     We need to get serious about addressing this challenge and this legislation is an important step in the right direction                We have an opportunity to increase the effectiveness of the Army and alleviate the stress placed on the National Guard and Army Reserves due to the long term commitment the Administration has made in Iraq     Senator Reed stated     While increasing the size of the Army is absolutely necessary to maintain our commitments across the globe  it is also critical that the increase  s funding is provided in the annual Defense Authorization budget rather than relying on continued supplemental after supplemental                The Army is being asked to do too much with too few people in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere     said Senator Nelson     At the same time  the United States must be prepared to meet a broader range of threats   anywhere in the world  especially from terrorists             Since 1945  the size of the active duty Army has dropped in times of peace and spiked during wartime   At the end of the Cold War  the Army shrank as part of the   peace dividend      However  now  in a time of war  the size of our Army has not followed the historic precedent of increasing to meet the demands placed on it   While we have increased defense spending since September 11  permanent troop levels have not risen accordingly                         Without increasing troop levels  the force requirements of the ongoing operations in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere as part of the Global War on Terror are unsustainable   There are currently approximately 499 000 active duty Army troops backed up by nearly 700 000 National Guard and Army reservists  a third less than the force level on hand when the first Gulf War was fought in 1991   This relationship between the total number of troops versus the number of operationally deployed troops has resulted in an active duty force that is stretched to the limit           In addition to hampering the military  s ability to successfully complete the missions assigned to it  this overuse has significant consequences for domestic homeland security operations   A disproportionate number of federal  state and local first responders are also Guard and Reserve members   At a time of strain for large municipalities struggling to secure their infrastructure against the threat of terrorism  the drain on available personnel as well as budgets is unacceptable             In announcing the legislation  the Members of Congress emphasized that this prolonged strain on our active duty members of the Army and our Guard and Reserves is damaging the long term ability of these components to operate effectively   Increased force requirements since September 11 have resulted in soldiers facing constant deployments into war zones without rest  training and preparation   The Guard and Reserve have been strained to the breaking point for years on end   To continue to retain and recruit the high quality soldiers we need for our 21st century fighting force  we must slow down their deployment schedules and make them more predictable             As a member of the House Armed Services Committee  I have long sought solutions to relieve our overstretched military and give us enough troops to meet current and new threats to the United States   Raising the cap on the size of the U S  Army will reduce the need for back to back tours  stop loss orders  and lengthy  unpredictable deployments  making the military a more attractive place to serve   It  s critical that we combat the recruitment and retention problems that threaten to break our all volunteer Army by reducing the overwhelming burden placed on the shoulders of such a small number of soldiers     said Representative Ellen O  Tauscher                    The war in Iraq has put a tremendous strain on our Army  Our troops are overstretched   not just in Iraq and Afghanistan but in 117 other countries around the world   and unprepared to meet potential future threats   Additionally  we continue to rely too heavily on our Guard and Reserve  Our troop levels should reflect the fact that we are at war   said Representative Udall    Without this bill  we risk asking too much of our men and women in uniform who have performed so courageously and sacrificed so much in their service to this country  They  future recruits  and the country all need to know that we are committed to providing the resources necessary to keep our Army strong            In order for the Army to fulfill its operational requirements today as well as face the contingencies of the future  it must be larger   Some progress was made toward this goal when Congress authorized an increase of 20 000 troops   However  this increase was not enough to provide the long term relief or support that the Army requires in order to fulfill its mission   In order to provide a lasting  long term solution to the Army  s challenges  an additional increase of 80 000 troops is required   This number will equip the Army with sufficient personnel so that it may not only engage in a stabilization operation like Iraq  but so that it may do so while maintaining optimal troop rotation schedules
