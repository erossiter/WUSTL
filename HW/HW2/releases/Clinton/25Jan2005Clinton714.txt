                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   With the 109th Congress underway  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today signaled that Homeland Security would remain one of her top priorities  with the introduction of the Domestic Defense Fund Act of 2005  providing critical resources to our first responders and to communities on the front lines of our nation s defense        The Domestic Defense Fund Act of 2005 is similar to legislation that Senator Clinton introduced last year and is aimed at increasing the flow of Homeland Security funds directly to local communities  The legislation would provide threat based and direct funding to cities and towns  as well as states  and would increase the overall amount of federal dollars available  The legislation also includes  2 billion for the Urban Area Security Initiative  which provides resources to high threat urban areas  as well as much needed funding for port  rail  inter city bus  and truck security and the protection of high threat non profit organizations        This legislation  which is co sponsored by Senator Charles Schumer  is supported by the US Conference of Mayors  the International Association of Fire Fighters  and the National Association of Police Organizations         Throughout the more than three years since the September 11th terrorist attacks  communities across America have found themselves on the front lines in the war against terrorism and our states  cities  counties  towns  and villages    working with our first responders    have been forced to shoulder a significant portion of the burden that goes along with that responsibility          We cannot continue to leave our communities on the front line without the resources to protect us   Senator Clinton said   The Domestic Defense Fund Act of 2005 will significantly improve our nation s homeland defense by providing our local communities  states  and first responders with the critical homeland security resources they so desperately need   Senator Clinton said          DOMESTIC DEFENSE FUND ACT OF 2005  Under this legislation  communities and states across America will receive federal funds directly to help them improve security and public safety locally  Modeled on the Community Development Block Grant program  the Domestic Defense Fund of 2005 provides  7 billion in annual funding to local communities  states  and first responders  This funding must be allocated based on threat  vulnerability  and many of the specific factors homeland security experts have long recommended  The legislation makes it explicit that this funding will not supplant or be in lieu of funding for traditional first responders programs like the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program and the Assistance to Fire Fighters  FIRE  Act program  which have proven successful in helping first responders perform traditional functions  such as fighting crime and responding to fires         Under the Act  Domestic Defense funds can be used for a wide variety of homeland security needs  such as training  planning  first responder interoperable communications equipment  personal protective equipment  and first responder overtime expenses         The key provisions of the Act are              Direct Funding to Metropolitan Cities and Urban Counties   2 45 billion        Increased Funding for the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI   which

than 1 000 cities in metropolitan areas with a population of 50 000 or more and urban counties across the United States based on a specific threat and risk based formula  This formula includes the following factors  which are equally weighted  except the three factors immediately below that will receive greater weight              Intelligence threat information  25        Population

power facilities  energy infrastructure  inland waterway infrastructure  rail transportation infrastructure  and agriculture infrastructure  and      Proximity to each of the following  international borders  major U S  water and land ports  airports  and national icons and federal facilities that may be targets of terrorist threats         Funds must be distributed directly to communities within 60 days of the date the funds are appropriated        The remaining 30 percent   1 05 billion  in grant funds will be distributed initially to the states for the purpose of the states then transferring funds to smaller communities  The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security must allocate these funds to the states based on factors such as threat  vulnerability  population  population density  the presence of critical infrastructure  and other factors the Secretary deems appropriate  States must transfer funds to these communities within 45 days of the date the states

in responding to terrorist attacks              establishing timely notification systems that enable communities to communicate with each other when a threat emerges  and             improving communication systems to provide information to the public in a timely and effective manner about any threat and the precautions the public should take         II  Direct Funding to States    An

Increased Funding for the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI     While communities all across the country are struggling to improve their homeland defense  there are certain communities that have been deemed high threat high risk urban areas by the Department of Homeland Security  In addition to high threat high risk urban area grants  DHS funds UASI programs to improve the security of our rail  port  and bus  and trucking infrastructures  as well as for the protection of certain high threat non profit organizations         The Domestic Defense Fund authorizes   2 billion for UASI programs  For high threat high risk urban areas  the Secretary will make allocations based upon criteria including credible threat  vulnerability  population  population density  the presence of critical infrastructure  the identified needs of public agencies  and other factors the Secretary deems appropriate  Grant funds must be transferred directly to the high threat urban areas within 60 days of the date the funds are appropriated         IV  Flexible Emergency Assistance Fund    The Domestic Defense Fund provides  500 million for a Flexible Emergency Assistance Fund from which the

terrorist threat              when a state or local community has been asked to assist in a federal investigation concerning homeland security or terrorism             when a federal agency has requested a state or local government to assist that agency in performing homeland security functions  and             when a local community is the venue of a high profile terrorist trial related to homeland security or terrorism        The Secretary may also use funds to reimburse local communities and states for the personnel costs associated with activation of first responders who serve in the Reserves or National Guard         V  Federal Preparedness  Equipment and Training Standards    The Act requires the Department of Homeland Security  in consultation with first responders  states
