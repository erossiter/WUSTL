December 21  2007 Senator Clinton Announces Department of Homeland Security Inspector General to Launch Investigation of Contractor Bonuses at Her Urging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  Inspector General  IG  has agreed to examine award fees for DHS contractors   In particular  the DHS IG will investigate the award fees paid to Chenega Technology Services Corporation and will work with DHS to collect information on the number and value of contracts DHS awarded during the 2007 fiscal year that include award fee provisions  and the oversight mechanisms DHS has to ensure that award fees are awarded in a proper manner   In addition to calling for the investigation  Senator Clinton secured a measure in the FY2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill to bar DHS from awarding bonuses to contractors without regard to performance    The American people deserve to know that precious homeland security funds are being used appropriately   It is critical that the Department of Homeland Security hold contractors accountable  not reward bad behavior   With high risk areas like New York fighting for limited homeland security funds  it is beyond the pale that DHS is awarding bonuses to contractors that they havent even earned  said Senator Clinton      In announcing the investigation  Senator Clinton noted that she had requested a broader based investigation and expressed serious concern about the inability of the DHS IG to undertake such an investigation   In a letter to Senator Clinton  the DHS IG indicated that  Generally  insufficient record keeping  extensive staff turnover in key acquisition roles  and inadequate data systems are common challenges we encounter in accomplishing our DHS acquisition reviews    Senator Clinton wrote to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General in November calling on the IG to expand an investigation of federal contracting practices to investigate the practice of award fees by DHS  especially when it comes to no bid contracts  Senator Clintons call came following a recent report by the DHS Inspector General that DHS improperly awarded a  475 million no bid contract to Chenega Technology Services Corporation  which according to the report likely did not provide the government the best value and that DHS did not comply with federal regulations   According to the IGs office  the agency also provided award fees to the company as part of its contract      The following is Senator Clintons letter to DHS Inspector General Richard L  Skinner requesting an investigation     November 26  2007   Mr  Richard L  Skinner  Inspector General  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C  20528   Dear Mr  Skinner    I write regarding a disturbing report you issued last month that raises serious questions about contracting practices at the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   The report  Customs and Border Protection Award and Oversight of Alaska Native Corporation Contract for Enforcement Equipment Maintenance and Field Operations Support  OIG 08 10   details how DHS improperly awarded a  475 million  no bid contract to Chenega Technology Services Corporation to maintain X ray  radiation and other screening machines at U S  border checkpoints  Your report concludes the contract award likely did not provide the government the best value and that DHS did not comply with federal regulations    Additionally  your staff informs me that award fees were given to Chenega as a part of its contract with DHS  Given that your report did not focus on award fees to Chenega  the details of these fees are unclear  However  taken together with your conclusion that the Department improperly awarded the underlying contract to Chenega  it is disturbing to hear that DHS has provided an award fee to this corporation     This disconnect between performance and award fees appears to be part of a troubling pattern  The Federal Acquisition Regulations  FAR  state clearly that cost based award fee contracts are intended to motivate excellent contractor performance in areas such as quality  timeliness  technical ingenuity  and cost effective management  Despite this guidance  during the course of the past several years there have been a number of reports documenting how award fees are being doled out by DHS to contractors regardless of performance     Evaluation of TSAs contract for the installation and maintenance of explosive detection equipment at United States Airports  DHS Inspector General  September 2004   TSA awarded a contract to Boeing for the installation and maintenance of explosive detection equipment at airports  TSA paid more than  44 million to Boeing without any evaluation of Boeings performance      Transportation Security Administration Review of the TSA Passenger and Baggage Screening Pilot Program  DHS Inspector General  September 2004   TSA awarded four pilot program contracts to determine whether private companies could provide and maintain passenger screening performance at levels equal to or greater than the TSA screener force  The Inspector General found the award fee determinations lacked performance criteria  were highly subjective and based primarily on contractor self assessments and input from TSA officials      Observations on the Department of Homeland Securitys Acquisition Organization and on the Coast Guards Deepwater Program  GAO 07 453T   February 8  2007   GAO found that despite documented problems in schedule  performance  cost control  and contract administration throughout the first year of the Deepwater contract  the contractor had received a rating of 87 percent  which fell in the very good range and resulted in an award fee of  4 million     In too many cases  DHS appears to be awarding bonuses despite poor performance  or worse  without even evaluating work  Failing contractors should be rooted out  not rewarded  Given your report of what appears to be noncompliant federal contracting practices on the part of the DHS and a pattern of providing award fees to contractors without justification  I request that you expand your investigation into the practice of award fees by the Department  especially when it comes to no bid contacts  Specifically  I would ask that your investigation review the following questions     Section 3501 of the U S  Troop Readiness  Veterans Care  Katrina Recovery  and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act  2007  P L  110 28  states  The Secretary of Homeland Security shall require that all contracts of the Department of Homeland Security that provide award fees link such fees to successful acquisition outcomes  which outcomes shall be specified in terms of cost  schedule  and performance   DHS has engaged in a number of contracts in Fiscal Year 2007  How many of these contracts included award fees and were these award fees based on successful acquisition outcomes  What was the total amount of these award fees      Did the Department of Homeland Security violate P L  110 28 in providing award fees to contractors Fiscal Year 2007      Were award fees given to Chenega Technology Services Corporation justified and based on successful acquisition outcomes      What mechanisms are currently in place at DHS to ensure that award fees are awarded in a proper manner  Are these mechanisms enforced in providing award fees for DHS contracts  What can the Department of Homeland Security do to ensure that award fees are justified and based on successful acquisition outcomes     Thank you for attention to this matter      Sincerely   Hillary Rodham Clinton
