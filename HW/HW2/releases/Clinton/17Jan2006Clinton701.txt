January 17  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Department of Homeland Security Passport Alternative for Border Communities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Today  s announcement by the Department of Homeland Security that they intend to introduce a   passport card    for travel across our borders still leaves many questions unanswered and considerable room for concern  While I am pleased that the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State have abandoned their   passport only    requirement for U S  citizens who live in border communities  more details need to be forthcoming about the price and availability of their proposed   passport card     The plan outlined today does not sufficiently address all of the issues that make a passport only requirement so burdensome  including cost and accessibility  As I have said before  while national security  and in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount  it is crucial that any new travel requirements be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism and the regional economy  Any alternative must be sensible  easily obtainable and affordable and must take into consideration the realities of life along the border  I will continue to press the Department of Homeland Security for answers to these questions and for an alternative that takes into consideration the realities of life along the border   New York  s Northern Border communities deserve nothing less
