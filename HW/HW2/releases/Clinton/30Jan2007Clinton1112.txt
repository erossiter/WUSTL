January 30  2007 Senator Clinton Applauds AU Decision to Prevent Sudan from Assuming African Union Chair                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today applauded the decision of the African Union to decline to appoint Sudan as its chair  African Union nations elected Ghanaian President John Kufuor to serve as chairman in 2007  In a letter sent last week  Senator Clinton joined a bipartisan effort to encourage African Union  AU  leaders to consider all appropriate diplomatic means to prevent Sudan from gaining the chairmanship due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Darfur  Allowing Sudan to chair the AU would have raised serious questions about the organization  s ability to stop the violence and genocide in Darfur            I called on African Union leaders to provide assurance to the people of Darfur that they are willing to work toward stopping the increased violence  AU member states have once again proven to the international community that they are willing to send a bold message to the Sudanese government by keeping them from gaining the Chairmanship     said Senator Clinton          The Sudanese government has continued to resist international efforts to increase the peacekeeping mission in Darfur  Currently  one of the only protections being provided to the people of Darfur is the African Union Mission in Sudan  AMIS   The letter outlines the Senators   concerns that allowing Sudan to assume chairmanship of the AU could result in AMIS losing local and international legitimacy and endangering its own security           Senator Clinton has continually pressed both President Bush and the international community to more robustly combat the violence in Darfur  Recently Senator Clinton sent another letter to President Bush underscoring the growing need for action in Darfur  The letter also addressed the need for the Administration to share with Congress details of its  Plan B  for Darfur as the Sudanese government continues to resist full deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to the region  Senator Clinton was joined by 13 other senators in sending the letter to African Union leaders              The full text of the letter sent to African Union leaders follows             Dear Mr  Madam President       As you know the African Union  AU  will be conducting a vote for its chairmanship on January 29  2007   We write to encourage you to consider all appropriate diplomatic means to prevent Sudan from gaining the chairmanship due to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Darfur           Since the conflict in Sudan  s Darfur region ignited in early 2003  it is estimated that nearly 450 000 Sudanese have died from combat  hunger  and disease and more than 2 million people have been displaced   This atrocity has also had a profound effect on volatile regions across Sudan  s western border  where flows of Sudanese refugees and insurgents exacerbate existing security and humanitarian crises in Chad and the Central African Republic            African governments   concern over Khartoum  s continuing role in abuses in Darfur led the AU to defer Sudan  s chairmanship in 2005 and again in 2006   The situation in Darfur deteriorated substantially in the past year  largely due to the Sudanese government  s continuing policies of arming abusive militia forces  attacking civilians  and ensuring that perpetrators of abuses enjoy complete impunity from prosecution          The under staffed African Union Mission in Sudan  AMIS  is currently the only protection being provided to the people of Darfur  and its troops and operations are increasingly vulnerable due to rising insecurity   Despite the passage of the United Nations  UN  Resolution 1706 in August 2006  which authorized a sizeable UN force to be deployed  the government of Sudan has continued to resist international efforts to create a more robust peacekeeping mission in Darfur   If Sudan assumes chairmanship of the AU  AMIS will lose local and international legitimacy  endangering its own security and that of the civilians they were sent to protect   In a worst case scenario  Sudan  s oversight of AMIS could clear the war for a   second wave    of genocide in Darfur          Allowing Sudan to chair the AU would put into question the AU  s commitment to addressing conflict  human rights abuses and genocide   As you know  the AU has a responsibility to set a precedent and send a message to Sudan that the genocide is unacceptable and there will be consequences if more aggressive measures to stop the killing are not taken  The international community must not let the first genocide of the 21st century continue unabated   We urge you to set an example for the rest of the AU members by standing up for the people of Darfur and preventing Sudan from becoming the chairman of the AU
