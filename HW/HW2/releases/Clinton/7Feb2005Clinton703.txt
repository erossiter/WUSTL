February 7  2005 Senator Clinton Protests Planned Elimination of Community Development Block Grant program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        President s Budget a devastating blow to highly successful funding program for cities across New York and the nation   New York State could lose millions of dollars in funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today said she was disappointed by the President s decision to effectively eliminate the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  program in his Fiscal Year 2006 Budget  According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD   in Fiscal Year 2005  New York cities received almost  400 million in much needed grants through the program for affordable housing  social services  neighborhood revitalization and job development        The Bush budget would eliminate the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  and replace it with a new  consolidated program that is supposed to carry out the activities of 18 existing economic and community development programs  This new program is funded at  400 million less than the amount spent on CDBG alone last year  In sum  the 18 programs cost more than  5 6 billion a year and the Bush budget slashes this investment by 33 percent to  3 7 billion  In a further blow  the President s budget also eliminates the Community Services Block Grants  CSBG   a vital anti poverty funding program  in the same way        In Fiscal Year 2005  CDBG funding provided  393 million in 2004 to New York state  Late last week  after hearing reports of the proposed cuts  Senator Clinton wrote to President Bush directly to urge him to increase funding for both CDBG program          This is an incredible blow to cities across New York and the nation  The Community Development Block Grants program is a lifeline for many individuals already struggling to make ends meet   Senator Clinton said   And now the President wants to leave them out in the cold          Since 1974  this successful program has provided critical funds to cities so that they can make affordable housing available  revitalize run down neighborhoods and provide economic development opportunities to those who need them most   Senator Clinton said   I call on the President to rethink this near sighted decision          The CDBG program  begun in 1974  is designed to allow communities to develop affordable housing  neighborhood revitalization activities and economic opportunity  principally aimed at low and moderate income persons  Over the past 10 years  Congress has funded the CDBG program at no less than  4 billion dollars in each fiscal year  CDBG funds are tied to hundreds of major job creation and affordable housing success stories across the country         The Council of State Community Development Agencies  the National Association for County Community and Economic Development  the National Association of Counties  the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials  the National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies  the National Community Development Association  the National League of Cities  and the United States Conference of Mayors have all opposed the cuts        On Friday  Senator Clinton letter sent to President Bush protesting reported cuts to the CDBG program  The letter  which was signed by a number of Democratic Senators including Senators Schumer  Kerry  Kennedy  Corzine  Lautenberg  and Durbin  was prompted by media reports that suggested that the President s budget would propose cuts of up to 40  in the almost  5 billion program that allocates community development funding to cities across New York and the United States  Senator Clinton also joined with Senator Kennedy in sending a letter to the President protesting the proposed cuts to the CSBG program        A full breakdown of FY 2005 Community Development Block Grant Funding for cities in New York can be obtained on the Department of Housing and Urban Development s website at http   www hud gov offices cpd about budget budget05 index cfm          A copy of the Senators  letter is attached        February 3  2005       The Honorable George W  Bush President of the United States Washington  D C  20500       Dear Mr  President        We write in anticipation of receiving your proposed 2005 Budget because of initial reports concerning your Administration s proposal to eliminate nearly half of the  5 billion previously made available to cities  counties  and states in the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  program  The CDBG program permits communities to implement affordable housing and neighborhood revitalization activities and these funds are tied to hundreds of major job creation and affordable housing success stories across the country        The Council of State Community Development Agencies  the National Association for County Community and Economic Development  the National Association of Counties  the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials  the National Association of Local Housing Finance Agencies  the National Community Development Association  the National League of Cities  and the United States Conference of Mayors have all opposed these proposed cuts because they know that without these funds  creating opportunities for investment in our urban areas will only become exceedingly more difficult        The CDBG program  begun in 1974  is one of the most successful programs run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development  We cannot understand what it is about a program  with a mission designed to provide decent housing  a suitable living environment  and expanding economic opportunities  principally for low and moderate income persons  that would cause your Administration to initiate massive budgetary cuts as reported in recent weeks        If we are to move forward as a nation  and put more Americans back to work  then the CDBG cuts your Budget is expected to contain are simply unworkable  On December 26  2004  you hosted a White House Economic Conference in which you said   One of the tests of leadership at all levels of government is to confront problems before they become a crisis   Mr  President  we believe that the type of budgetary cuts you are proposing for our cities  counties  and states  will exacerbate the job  housing  and economic development crises so many American communities face at this moment        If reports that the CDBG program is currently slated for massive cuts are accurate  we urge you to reconsider such a harmful proposal  We look forward to working with your Administration to solve the economic problems facing communities across America  but we cannot make much progress if one of the most effective tools at our disposal    CDBG    is destroyed         Sincerely
