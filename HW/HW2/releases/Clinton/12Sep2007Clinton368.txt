September 12  2007 NJ  NY Senators Work to Get Government Answers about Reducing Flight Delays                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As Major Concerns Remain Over NY NJ Philly Airspace Redesign  Two Successful Amendments Will Mandate Assessments of Available Options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC  New Jersey and New Yorks U S  Senators today successfully passed legislation that would mandate the federal government to provide answers about plans to reduce flight delays  The Senators successfully attached two amendments to the Transportation  Housing  and Urban Development Appropriations bill  which passed the Senate today  requiring the government to report on available options  which is particularly important to the New York New Jersey Pennsylvania Region  the nations most densely congestion airspace    The amendments  which will go into effect when the bill is signed into law  were spurred by record delays for the flying public this summer and major concerns that the Federal Aviation Administrations announced Airspace Redesign for the New York New Jersey Philadelphia area will increase aircraft noise while providing only minimal delay reductions    Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ  and Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  were joined by Hillary Clinton  D NY  and Charles Schumer  D NY  on an amendment to ensure that the federal governments independent investigatory arm will examine the effectiveness of a variety of approaches used nationwide to reduce flight delays  The Senators said that Government Accountability Offices  GAO  report  which will be completed within 120 days of the bill being signed into law  will help determine if the Airspace Redesign plan will have a substantial effect on flight delays and whether other options used elsewhere will be more effective    Meanwhile Senator Clinton was joined by Senators Schumer  Lautenberg and Menendez on an amendment that would require the Secretary of Transportation to report to Congress about how the FAA intends to reduce congestion and flight delays in the New York New Jersey Philadelphia airspace by next summer  The amendment  which was co sponsored by Senators Dodd  Lieberman  Casey and Specter  would force the FAA to come up with a plan by next summer on how they will reduce these delays  The full implementation of the Airspace Redesign plan is not scheduled to be completed until 2011  In the meantime  the FAA must come up with a plan to address congestion and delays at area airports before the implementation of the Airspace Redesign project is complete     Air travelers have spent the summer stuck in airport terminals and on the tarmac  If theres a way to more substantially reduce grueling flight delays while keeping the roaring noise of jets out of our neighborhoods  we need to know  said Senator Menendez  This will give us an independent  thorough assessment of flight delay reduction options so we can see if it has been done better in other areas  Its pretty evident that the FAAs current plan just isnt going to fly with New Jersey residents    The Bush Administration wants to sacrifice our quality of life by allowing more flights over our homes and while providing little  if any  relief to delayed travelers   That s the wrong approach  said Senator Lautenberg   Our measure will require a better study of how to improve flight delays in our region without causing excessive air noise    The Airspace Redesign Project is a major undertaking and one that has the potential to impact so many New Yorkers  but its not a silver bullet in relieving the congestion in our airspace  This summer has been awful for commercial flyers when it comes to delays and the Administration must come up with a plan to address this problem as soon as possible   We must have a plan that helps clear the skies while addressing the very serious concerns about noise levels for communities on the ground  Senator Clinton said  We cannot wait ten to fifteen years for this resolved   We must clear up the delays at our airports  stop the terrifying near misses on the ground and relieve the congestion  as well as reduce noise to surrounding communities and consider the very real impact on residents sooner rather than later    Anyone who has taken a flight recently knows that the situation in Americas airports is appalling  and its only getting worse  said Senator Schumer  Our skies are gridlocked and the FAA has done next to nothing about it  While moves toward next generation technology are promising  we cannot wait another decade for the FAA to implement changes to address this crisis  This study will force the FAA to report on how they plan to address delays in the short term  The bottom line is that the FAA let conditions deteriorate to the point of chaos  and if the administration isnt held accountable by Congress  I have little reason to believe that the situation will improve   Details of Menendez Lautenberg Clinton Schumer amendment   Directs the GAO to conduct a study of the efficacy of various approaches used in the past by the FAA and the DOT to address delays at our nation s airports   Within 120 days of enactment  the GAO is to report which strategies have worked best to comprehensively reduce flight delays at an airport within 6 months or less   Specifically  the GAO is instructed to examine efforts by the FAA to induce voluntary schedule reductions at Chicago s O Hare International Airport  the FAA s mandatory flight reduction operations at LaGuardia International Airport and Reagan National Airport  the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Metropolitan Area Airspace Redesign and any other significant efforts by the FAA or the DOT to reduce flight delays at a major U S  international airport   Details of Clinton Schumer Lautenberg Menendez amendment   Specifically  the amendment requires the Secretary of Transportation to submit to Congress a report detailing how the Federal Aviation Administration plans to alleviate air congestion and flight delays in the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Airspace by August 31  2008  The report would have to be submitted to no later than 120 days after the enactment of the legislation
