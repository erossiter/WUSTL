September 6  2007 NY Senators   Tri State Reps   Request 9 11 Health Care Funding  in President s Budget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC  Today  Senators Charles Schumer  D NY   Senator Hillary Clinton  D NY  and Reps  Carolyn Maloney  D NY   Jerrold Nadler  D NY   Vito Fossella  R NY   Ed Towns  D NY   Christopher Shays  R CT  and Frank Pallone  D NJ  sent a joint letter  click here for a copy of the letter  to Jim Nussle  the incoming Director of the Office of Management and Budget  urging him to include adequate funding for the World Trade Center  WTC  Responder Health Program in the Presidents budget for Fiscal Year 2009  In January 2007  the Administration announced that the President s FY08 budget would request  25 million for the health needs of WTC Responders  At that time  then OMB Director Rob Portman stated that the  25 million was intended to serve as a placeholder until the Administration could prepare a comprehensive plan and more accurately determine the level of funding needed  However  the Administration has yet to release either its plan or its re evaluated funding request  The Administration needs to fully fund without further delay the health care  treatment  and testing of the thousands of selfless first responders who didnt hesitate for a moment to answer our nations call for help in the days  weeks  and months after 9 11  said Senator Schumer  With the sixth anniversary of 9 11 fast approaching  the federal government must step up to the plate and give these heroes the help and support they need and deserve  A continuing tragedy of 9 11 is the illness and suffering that is being experienced by our first responders  workers and volunteers  Sustained funding is critically needed to take care of those who are suffering  The Administration needs to make good on its commitment to provide adequate federal funding to cover all who are ill  Senator Clinton said  We are asking the President to follow through on his commitment to care for the thousands of 9 11 responders who are sick as a direct result of their service to our country  said Rep  Maloney  The WTC Responder Health Program needs both adequate funding and Presidential leadership to keep its doors open  We have learned a lot in the six years since 9 11  said Rep  Nadler  We have learned that the air was not safe to breathe  that the EPA has performed an inadequate test and clean program  and that thousands of first responders  residents  area workers and students that were exposed to the toxins released on 9 11 have become ill  Unfortunately  we have also come to understand that the federal response to their needs has been insufficient and the White House has been missing in action since it first proposed a fraction of the funds needed in its formal budget request  We are asking the White House to exercise the leadership necessary to request and secure proper funding for programs that will meet the health needs of the exposed community  Rep  Fossella said  It is critical that a steady stream of funding be available to ensure that our first responders continue to have access to medical monitoring and treatment  The  25 million was a starting point until a comprehensive analysis could be performed to determine a more exact amount of funding that would be needed  America s unsung heroes risked their own lives and health in responding to the 9 11 attacks  We have a responsibility to ensure that those who are sick or injured get the care they need  Those first responders and residents who are suffering from all types of respiratory illnesses are relying heavily on the WTC Responder Health Program  It is necessary that the President keep his promise and fully fund this project  said Congressman Towns   For years  efforts to create an organized  effective health plan system for first responders to Ground Zero have been incomplete and uncoordinated  Much work needs to be done to ensure those affected receive the care they deserve  and I hope the administration will fulfill its commitment to those exposed to the toxins from September 11  2001  and in the resulting cleanup  said Congressman Shays  Six years of administration foot dragging must end  Pallone said  The Bush administration needs to live up to its promises to provide critical funds for monitoring and treating 9 11 rescue and recovery workers  I would hope that the new OMB Director would take his predecessor s promises to heart  and would request the necessary funds to begin the process of helping the workers who accepted the call to serve their nation after its darkest day
