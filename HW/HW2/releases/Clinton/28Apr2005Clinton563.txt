April 28  2005 Senator Clinton Denounces Republican Leadership and White House Deal to Cut Medicaid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today denounced the decision by the White House and Congressional Republicans to slash Medicaid funding  calling it a prescription for disaster for states  local governments  health care providers and those who depend on the program as their only means of health care coverage   The budget agreement will cut Medicaid funding by  10 billion  cutting funding to New York by  1 37 billion over the next five years                Slashing Medicaid funding will do nothing to address Medicaid  s challenges   It will undermine the program and increase the burden on our states  local governments and health care providers when we should be working together to strengthen the program     said Senator Clinton     It is unconscionable to balance the budget on the backs of our most vulnerable Americans and that is exactly what the White House and Congressional Republicans have decided to do           Senator Clinton also stated that a planned White House Medicaid commission will do little to spur real reform   Senator Clinton joined forces with Senators Smith and Bingaman to win approval in the Senate budget resolution of a bipartisan commission to recommend how to improve service delivery and quality in the Medicaid program in a way that is cost effective   This bipartisan commission was removed from the final budget deal in favor of a presidentially appointed commission to recommend changes to Medicaid          It is indefensible to use calls for reform as a cover to further undermine Medicaid   We need to start with a commitment to strengthen Medicaid and uphold our commitment to preserve the health care safety net for our most vulnerable Americans   This commission is cause for serious concern            The Republican Medicaid cuts will have a profound effect on the delivery of health care in New York  forcing untenable choices about who can keep coverage and who can qualify for benefits in the future  New York s Medicaid program provides insurance to 4 1 million New Yorkers  including 1 7 million children  1 4 million adults and 1 million elderly and disabled beneficiaries   Medicaid is truly the last resort for these children  seniors  disabled Americans and New Yorkers living with AIDS and other chronic diseases         The Medicaid cuts will hit rural areas particularly hard   Nearly one in four residents of rural areas is uninsured  compared to less than one in five of those living in urban areas   Nearly 16 percent of people who live in rural areas have Medicaid coverage    compared with about 10 percent of people in urban areas  Medicaid covers more than one in four children in rural areas  27 percent of children in rural areas are enrolled in Medicaid  compared with less than 19 percent of children in urban areas
