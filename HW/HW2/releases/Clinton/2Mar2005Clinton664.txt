March 2  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Republicans Anti Poverty Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Today s announcement of an anti poverty proposal is simply a continuation of the Bush Administration s attempt to leave New Yorkers and other Americans who need our help the most out in the cold  We should not let them pull the wool over our eyes  Their anti poverty proposal will only add to the already alarming high number of American families and children living in poverty        I don t know how my Republican colleagues can seriously talk about an anti poverty program while the President proposes to slash critical programs like Head Start  LIHEAP  job training and ignore the need to increase minimum wage  These are investments in Americans that encourage and help our fellow citizens gain the skills and abilities to become self reliant  contributing members of our society  But the President has decided to slash job training and employment service programs by  316 million and cut education funding by  530 million  If adopted  this would be the first cut in education funding since 1996    leaving many children behind        It is time to take action and actually show compassion for individuals who need our help the most  Ninety percent of those who benefit from President Bush s tax breaks earn  200 000 or more each year  Instead of cutting taxes for the wealthy  we should be taking positive steps like increasing the minimum wage for those who are working multiple jobs to make ends meet  To defeat poverty you actually need to help people get out of poverty by giving them the resources they need  not take them away piece by piece
