                  Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed unanimous Senate approval of an amendment to the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act she introduced to increase burial travel allowances for families of deceased servicemembers   The amendment requires the Department of Defense  DoD  to authorize burial travel allowances for minor siblings of a deceased servicemember  and when necessary  provide burial travel allowances for the person authorized to direct the disposition of the remains I am pleased that the Senate has approved this much needed provision  Families suffering the loss of a loved one while serving their country so bravely should not be burdened with additional financial hardships  said Senator Clinton  This amendment will close the gap that currently exists in burial travel allowances  and provide comfort to families during the difficult grieving period    Senator Clintons amendment would authorize minor siblings of deceased servicemembers to travel to burial services at government expense   Currently  only spouses  dependent children  and parents of deceased servicemembers are authorized burial travel allowances  while travel for minor siblings of the deceased servicemember is either paid out of pocket  or with emergency funds provided by DoD    In some instances the emergency fund approval process has been untimely  causing a delay in travel plans or an absence of a family member   Additionally  DoD requires servicemembers to designate an individual responsible for burial arrangements as the Person Authorized to Direct Disposition   This person can be a spouse  parent  or another blood relative  however only spouses and parents are authorized burial travel allowances   Travel for a blood relative who is serving as the Person Authorized to Direct Disposition  and who is not a spouse or parent of the deceased servicemember  must pay out of pocket or apply for emergency funds to travel to the burial they are responsible to arrange  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform and their families have the best quality of life and support they need  most recently securing a series of measures in the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act approved unanimously by the Senate  The final FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act awaits full Senate passage    Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed unanimous Senate approval of an amendment to the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization Act she introduced
