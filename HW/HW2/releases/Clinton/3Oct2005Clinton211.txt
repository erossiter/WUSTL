October 3  2005 Clinton Calls on Bush Administration to Implement Federal Government Oil Savings Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senate Democrats Call For Initiative to Reduce Federal Petroleum  Use by 40 percent by 2020  Relying on Alternatives and Efficiency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined sixteen of her colleagues in calling on President Bush to make a serious  long term commitment to curbing America  s dependence on oil  starting with the federal government itself   In a letter sent today  the Senators urged the President to immediately require federal agencies to begin implementing a Clinton era Executive Order  which established a five year  20 percent petroleum savings goal   They also urged the President to extend the order  and to set a 40 percent savings target for federal agencies by 2020   Since 1999  the federal government has reduced its petroleum consumption by less than one percent               The President has asked Americans to conserve oil  but has not taken steps to reduce the oil consumption of the federal government     Senator Clinton said    It is time for the President to implement an aggressive plan to ensure that the federal government is doing everything possible to use oil more efficiently              The letter was sent on the same day that Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman unveiled an energy saving program that outlines ways for Americans to conserve on oil consumption  but fails to provide any commitment by the federal government to reduce its own consumption   Last week  President Bush said    there  s ways for the federal government to lead when it comes to conservation     but there has yet to be any plan to back these words            In 2000  President Clinton signed an Executive Order setting a goal of reducing federal government petroleum consumption by 20 percent in five years   According to a recent report by Department of Energy  since Fiscal Year 1999 the federal government has reduced its petroleum consumption by only 0 6 percent   In fact  the most recent data on federal fleet compliance indicates that the Executive Office of the President also failed to meet its requirements for alternative fuel vehicles established under the Energy Policy Act of 1992  signed into law during the first Bush Administration            Text of the letter follows below           October 3  2005          President George W  Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  Washington  DC  20500               Dear Mr  President           The recent hurricanes and their tragic aftermath continue to teach us many critical lessons about the importance of federal leadership in response to national emergencies and natural disasters   One of these lessons is that American consumers  businesses  and our economy as a whole are unacceptably vulnerable to oil supply shocks and price volatility that endanger both the economic and national security interests of the United States             We are prepared to work with you to help ease the immediate  short term burdens of energy price spikes on American families and communities   But in addition  we believe that developing a serious  long term strategy to curb our nation  s dangerous dependence on oil is long overdue   As such  we noted with interest your call last week for American consumers and federal employees to curtail non essential travel and conserve gasoline supplies  and that   there s ways for the federal government to lead when it comes to conservation              We agree that as the nation  s largest energy consumer  the federal government itself can play an important role in enhancing the energy security of the United States   But this initiative deserves more than passing lip service   This nation must make a long term commitment to the adoption of cutting edge efficiency and alternative fuel technologies   Federal leadership can help put America on the path toward energy independence           In April 2000  the Clinton Administration recognized this potential when it issued Executive Order 13149   This policy set a national goal of reducing federal agencies   petroleum consumption by 20 percent in Fiscal Year 2005  using a combination of alternative fuel and vehicle efficiency technologies   The initiative was designed to   help promote markets for more alternative fuel and fuel efficient vehicles  encourage new technologies  enhance the United States  energy self sufficiency and security  and ensure a healthier environment through the reduction of greenhouse gases and other pollutants in the atmosphere      Today  these objectives have taken on a new urgency           But unfortunately  five years later  the federal government has failed to make serious progress in meeting these goals   In fact  the Fiscal Year 2004 annual report compiled by the Department of Energy suggests that the federal government has reduced its petroleum consumption by a mere 0 6 percent since Fiscal Year 1999   America can and must do better          The rapidly evolving global economy and the national security related challenges we face at the dawn of the 21st Century make it abundantly clear that curbing our dangerous dependence on oil is a pressing national priority   As such  we urge you to direct federal agencies to begin immediately striving for compliance with Executive Order 13149  s original goal of reducing petroleum consumption by 20 percent            But in addition  we believe that the lessons of the recent hurricanes  as well as the domestic and international implications of our nation  s oil dependence demand an even bolder  long term vision of American energy independence   We further urge you to extend this Executive Order to require a 40 percent reduction in federal petroleum consumption by 2020   This step would demonstrate a serious federal commitment to improving our nation  s energy security  setting an example for the rest of the country to follow   Moreover  it could save the equivalent of 112 million gallons of gasoline  or almost 2 7 million barrels of oil  each year           Securing our nation  s energy future is among the biggest economic and national security challenges faced by our generation   The status quo  in which the security of the United States and the vitality of our domestic economy is left to the whims foreign regimes and companies that may not have the best interests of our nation at heart   is simply not an option   How your Administration and Congress rise to meet this challenge will be one of the most important tests on which future generations of Americans will come to measure our leadership and resolve            We stand ready to work with you to develop a serious and sustainable national strategy to curb our nation  s dangerous dependence on oil   We urge you to take these important first steps  which would truly establish the federal government as a leader in the effort to improve America  s energy security            Sincerely           Senator Cantwell       Senator Bingaman       Senator Reid       Senator Kerry       Senator Wyden       Senator Boxer       Senator Lieberman       Senator
