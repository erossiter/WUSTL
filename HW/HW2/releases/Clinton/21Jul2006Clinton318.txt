July 21  2006 Schumer  Clinton Announce Key Senate Panel Approval of  12 1 Million in Defense and Military Construction Funding for Central New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Funds included in Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill and Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed approval late yesterday by the Senate Appropriations Committee of the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill and the Fiscal Year 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Bill  which includes  12 1 million for Central New York          The bills will now proceed to the Senate floor for consideration   Following consideration and passage on the Senate floor  the bills will head into a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between their versions  Following conference  the bills will again be sent to the House and Senate for final approval  after which they will be sent to the President for his signature            This is great news for Central New York   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Capitol Region and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Capitol Region defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge   I am also thrilled that funding was allocated for NEADS   Northeast Air Defense Sector Support Facility at the former Griffiss Air Force Base  This funding is crucial in securing the best training and equipment available for our courageous sons and daughters serving in uniform                As our men and women in uniform continue to fight bravely overseas  these New York companies are helping to support them with the best equipment and technology available  This funding is a tremendous boost to these local companies who are on the cutting edge of research and development and are also local employers  contributing to our regional economy  As we look to develop the state  s future as a center for research and results  these are the kinds of investments that we need to continue making     Senator Clinton said    I am also very pleased that the Senate Appropriators have retained the funding for NEADS   Northeast Air Defense Sector Support Facility which is critical to the mission and the future of the former Griffiss Airforce Base             Funding in the FY 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Bill includes         NEADS Support Facility  Phase II    6 6 million    This bill includes  6 6 million above the President  s budget request  to complete Phase II construction of the Northeast Air Defense Sector Support Facility   NEADS requires a new support facility to replace aging ones  which are currently not co located  and to improve force protection of assigned resources   This is a two phase construction project with Phase I having been approved and supported with  3 million in FY 06 military construction funding   The Northeast Air Defense Sector is located on the former Griffiss Air Force Base   Unit personnel are housed in three different locations   Relocating the Headquarters building inside the SOCC Compound and moving personnel from Depot 1 to this building will improve protection of NEADS personnel and facilities          Funding in the FY 2007 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill includes          Source Sentinel    Detection of Biological Agents in Water    1 5 million    This funding will allow Source Sentinel to further their project on the Detection of Biological Agents in Water   This project will support the research  development  application and commercialization of basic and applied research to deploy biosensors to protect water and air systems against man made natural toxin incursion with near real time alert  information fusion and automatic manual response reaction in order to assure protection of municipal water supplies   If implemented successfully  the project has the potential to provide detection and alert capability for the over 4 000 uncovered reservoirs and 15 000 water treatment facilities nationwide   Designed to be deployed on a buoy  on a submerged fixture or in a potable water pump station  the device provides continuous real time monitoring via air and water quality sensors that are able to detect and provide ample near real time warning of the presence of agents that are potential biological terrorism agents  These technologies will be able to provide ample near real time warning of the presence of inorganic and organic chemicals and specific bacteria in air or water  and will provide an integrated response system that aids an alerted operator in the conduct of the correct emergency action plan measures and procedures in the event of a toxin incursion into the air and water supply from before or at the intake       Rome ITT    Masint Warfighter Tools    1 5 million     This funding for Air Force Research Laboratory  AFRL  Rome Research Labs and ITT Space Systems Division will help them to further their Measurement and Signals Intelligence  MASINT  project   MASINT offers huge benefits in identifying obscured and hidden targets  but the near term challenge is to integrate MASINT into existing and future information processing systems in a way that enables users to manage and display the information in time to take action   MASINT gathers measurements from unintentional radiation  effluent and debris sampling  acoustic signals  non visible imaging and other sources and then subjects that data to specialized processing in order to transform it into actionable intelligence for both national command and tactical users   This funding would allow the AFRL Rome Research Site to build upon the initial success of the MASINT Visualization Tools Program and allow an expansion into newer  less mature techniques such as hyperspectral  acoustic and overhead non imaging infrared   It will also expedite the integration of MASINT into the information architectures of other national security agencies       Syracuse Research Corporation    Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Base Protection  LCMR BP  Systems    1 5 million    The Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar  LCMR  operates in the battlefield today  protecting the war fighter from mortars and rockets  By networking LCMRs and or other sensors together in the Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar Base Protection  LCMR BP  System  the safety of our soldiers will be increased and the accuracy of our responses will be greatly enhanced  The LCMR BP will provide scalable  low cost high reliability forward operating base protection that can handle a variety of threat situations with greater reliability to warn and respond         The Cortland Companies    Synthetic Material Arresting Cable    1 million    This funding will continue existing efforts to investigate the use of lightweight  synthetic materials and novel cable construction to replace the steel cables that recover aircraft aboard U S  Navy Aircraft Carriers   This testing includes   fatigue testing and analysis at a Navy Test Site that is representative of shipboard gear  design improvements based on fatigue tests  development of synthetic material sheaves and model development and validation in order to quantify performance benefits associated with synthetic cable   Synthetic cables could improve the factor of safety of the entire system by 60    Because the strength to weight of synthetic materials is 4 5 times better than steel  system inertia is significantly reduced  enabling the arresting gear to apply breaking force much earlier in the stroke  The use of synthetic cable also possesses a potential weight savings of 62 tons per carrier and increase arresting gear performance by 25
