April 18  2007 Clinton Calls on President to Provide Disaster Assistance to Storm Damaged Areas Throughout New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Calls on IRS to Extend Tax Filing Deadline by Two More Weeks for Impacted Residents Listen to audio of Senator Clinton s comments   Washington  DC   In anticipation of a request for federal assistance from New York s Governor Spitzer  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to quickly provide the necessary aid and assistance to the areas that have been hit by the recent Nor easter storm as soon as it is formally requested by the Governor  In a letter to President Bush  Clinton asked that as soon as he receives the request for disaster assistance from Governor Spitzer  the White House expedite FEMA s assessment of the storm damage and issue a Presidential Disaster Declaration consistent with the Stafford Act as soon as possible            This storm has wreaked havoc on many communities  leaving many people and their homes and businesses severely damaged  Governor Spitzer has already toured some of the devastated areas  As soon as the Governor requests the necessary federal assistance  I hope the President will grant his request so that residents  business owners  farmers and other can get on with the job of recovering and rebuilding their lives   Senator Clinton said   I know that New York and local officials are already working together to collect damage information in the interest of building the strongest case for federal assistance and when they do  I hope the President will be willing to help           Senator Clinton today also called on Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Mark Everson to grant a further extension of at least two weeks for the tax filing deadline to the 1st of May to enable the residents to ensure their families  safety and assess their damages and losses without fear of missing the IRS deadline  The IRS has announced a special 48 hour extension of time to file tax returns granted to victims of the April 16 storm in the Northeast            I also hope the IRS will consider a longer extension of the filing deadline to enable impacted families to take care of their homes  property and welfare without fear of missing the tax filing deadline  I appreciate that the IRS has already granted a 48 hour extension but I think that many families will need even longer than that         A copy of Senator Clinton s letters to President Bush and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Everson are attached       The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President       I write in anticipation of a request from Governor Eliot Spitzer seeking an Presidential Disaster Declaration for those counties in New York that were severely impacted by the recent Nor easter storm that ravaged parts of the northeast and urge your quick approval            The storm has caused excessive damage to infrastructure and private property   According to press reports  in New York City  the National Weather Service said  52 inches of rain fell on Central Park on Monday and 7 57 inches on Sunday  a record for that date  In Westchester County  approximately 8 inches was recorded in White Plains  The area is not expected to dry out completely until Friday   Homes and businesses remained without power Tuesday morning and across parts of New York basements are flooded  houses are threatened due to erosion and businesses are water damaged   States of emergency have been declared in the Columbia  Greene  Rockland  Putnam and Westchester counties with Mamaroneck  New Rochelle  and Yonkers among the most severely affected   Rivers in Westchester and the Hudson Valley overflowed their banks   Long Island witnessed flooding in coastal communities  including Copiague  Amityville  Lindenhurst  Lake Ronkonkoma and Babylon  which also face the threat of more flooding with the coming high tide   On Fire Island  some homes were clinging to the shoreline after waves eroded the sand          To recover  residents will need necessary federal assistance to repair their homes and small businesses   I also assume that local governments  already stretched by structural financial shortfalls  will need further assistance to restore infrastructure and to assist their citizens          Upon the request from Governor Spitzer  I urge you to expedite the Federal Emergency Management Agency s  FEMA  assessment of the storm damage and issue a Presidential Disaster Declaration consistent with the Stafford Act as soon as possible I look forward to working with you to help the citizens of New York recover from this storm          I thank you for your immediate consideration   Please do not hesitate to contact me directly should you need additional information          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton        Dear Mr  Everson       As you know parts of New York State were hit by a severe storm this past weekend that has resulted in significant flooding  power outages  dangerous travel conditions and other hazards in the affected areas            I am aware that the Internal Revenue Service  IRS  has granted an extension of the tax filing deadline by two days beyond today s date   I certainly appreciate the IRS s consideration of the ability of taxpayers affected by the storm to file timely returns   However  given the extensive nature of the disruptions caused by the storms  I believe that a longer extension is warranted   Indeed  the relentless rainfall  snowfall and other dangerous weather conditions brought by the storm have precipitated evacuations in some areas  not to mention the hundreds of millions  if not billions of dollars in damages to homes  businesses and other property to those affected   In light of these circumstances  at least a two week extension of the tax filing deadline to the 1st of May would enable the residents of New York to ensure their families  safety and assess their damages and losses without fear of missing the IRS deadline           I request that you give all due consideration to this request and please keep in mind the harsh conditions being faced by thousands of New Yorkers   I believe that extension of the tax filing deadline is reasonable and would tremendously benefit the residents of New York affected by this storm  while causing minimal disruption to the IRS  duties and timetables           Thank you for your attention to this matter
