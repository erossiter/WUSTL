                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Senator says recent outbreaks and vaccine shortages increase the need for education about how to prevent and treat the disease      Summer months also bring higher demands for vaccine and information                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  to step up their education efforts about meningococcal meningitis  a disease that affects thousands of Americans each year  causing about 300 deaths nationwide  About 60 cases of meningococcal meningitis occur annually in New York          In a letter to the CDC today  Senator Clinton noted that recent vaccine shortages mean there is a need for increased education to reach target populations about early detection and treatment  The summer months are when the target populations for the meningitis vaccine    adolescents and young adults   are heading off to camps and colleges  at which many of them will be living in shared quarters that may facilitate meningitis transmission  Senator Clinton today also released a fact sheet about meningococcal meningitis  how to recognize the symptoms and where to get help            Meningococcal meningitis is a very serious but preventable and treatable disease   The current vaccine shortages  which have come right at the same time as those most vulnerable to the disease are heading to camp and soon to college  mean that we must take extra steps to warn parents  camp counselors  teachers and others about how to recognize and treat this potential threat     Senator Clinton said    While the CDC has taken steps to deal with the vaccine shortage  more needs to be done to expand our early detection and treatment efforts              A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter to the CDC is attached          July 7  2006      Julie Louise Gerberding  M D   M P H   Director  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Department of Health   Human Services  1600 Clifton Road  N W   Atlanta  Georgia 30329      Dear Dr  Gerberding       As you are aware  our nation is currently experiencing a shortage of a vaccine for meningococcal meningitis  commonly referred to as MCV 4  which has caused significant concern among pediatricians and parents   While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already taken action to revise its recommendations for vaccination to reflect this shortage  I am writing to request that you take additional action regarding this disease to ensure that employees at camps and colleges are fully educated about meningococcal disease          Meningococcal meningitis affects thousands of Americans each year  causing about 300 deaths nationwide   About 60 cases occur annually in New York   Those who survive this disease may be affected by permanent hearing loss  neurological dysfunctions  and paralysis   What makes this disease particularly dangerous is the rapidity with which symptoms progress   Yet if patients with meningococcal disease receive early treatment with antibiotics  the risk of death and disability can be reduced          While vaccination is our best defense against meningococcal meningitis  in this time of shortage  it is imperative that we expand efforts to improve early detection   The target populations for this vaccine    adolescents and young adults    are now heading off to camps and colleges  at which many of them will be living in shared quarters that may facilitate meningitis transmission   As a result  I believe that we must increase our efforts to ensure that those institutions and their employees are aware of the symptoms of meningitis  the dangers posed by this disease  and the actions that should be taken if they are faced with possible cases of meningococcal disease   I would ask that you increase the CDC  s efforts to perform outreach with camps and colleges to improve early detection and treatment of meningococcal meningitis          I understand that you have been working with state and local health departments during this shortage  and I ask that you continue efforts to keep them informed and aware of this shortage   While the CDC is encouraging providers to track those patients who defer receiving the vaccine  it is imperative that we provide adequate technical assistance to providers and state and local health departments to ensure full follow up and vaccination of children who do not receive the vaccine during this shortage   I would urge you increase your efforts to partner with professional organizations to help providers understand the importance of tracking and implement such systems in their practice          Thank you for your agency  s efforts to raise awareness of this disease   As this shortage continues  I look forward to working with you to ensure that we are able to improve early detection of this disease  track those who defer the vaccine  and reduce the number of deaths that result from meningitis annually           Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton      MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS FAQ      What is meningococcal meningitis     The New York State Department of Health  NYSDOH  defines meningococcal meningitis as a rare  but potentially fatal bacterial infection that causes inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord       How is the disease spread     The American College Health Association  ACHA  says that meningococcal meningitis is spread through the air by respiratory droplets  coughing  sneezing  etc    or by direct contact with infected persons  sharing drinks or cigarettes  kissing  etc          How common is the disease  How dangerous is it     The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  says that each year in the United States  1 400 to 2 800 people get meningococcal disease   10 14  percent of people with meningococcal disease die  and 11 19  of survivors have permanent disabilities  including neurological effects  impaired hearing  and loss of limbs        Who is most at risk for getting this disease     According to the American College Health Association  approximately 30  of all cases of meningitis in the country occur in adolescents and young adults  Further research recently released by the CDC shows freshmen living in dormitories have a six times higher risk of meningococcal disease than college students overall   Approximately 100 to 125 cases of meningococcal disease occur on college campuses each year  and 5 to 15 students will die as a result           The NYSDOH also says that patients with respiratory infections  compromised immunity  those in close contact to a known case and travelers to endemic areas of the world are also at increased risk       What are the symptoms of meningococcal meningitis     NYSDOH says that early symptoms usually associated with meningococcal disease include fever  severe headache  stiff neck  rash  nausea  vomiting  lethargy  and other flu like symptoms       What should I do if I notice these symptoms in myself or my child     Because the disease progresses rapidly  often in as little as 12 hours  if you notice the sudden onset of two or more of these symptoms  the NYSDOH recommends that you seek immediate medical attention       Is there treatment available for meningococcal meningitis     According to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene  DOHMH   there are several effective antibiotics for treating the disease       Should people who have been in contact with a diagnosed case of meningococcal meningitis be treated      The NYSDOH says that only people who have been in close contact  household members  intimate contacts  health care personnel performing mouth to mouth resuscitation  day care center playmates  etc   need to be considered for preventive treatment  Such people are usually advised to obtain a prescription for a special antibiotic from their physician  Casual contact  as might occur in a regular classroom  office or factory setting  is not usually significant enough to cause concern        Is there a vaccine   Who should get it     Yes  there is a vaccine available that the NYSDOH says protects the body from most strains of meningitis  approximately 70  of all cases result from these strains    The NYSDOH also says that the side effects are very mild  most commonly redness and or pain at the place of injection for up to two days          On February 10  2005  the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  ACIP  for the CDC voted to recommend that all incoming freshmen living in dormitories be vaccinated against meningococcal disease   The ACIP also recommended vaccination for all adolescents at high school entry and during pre adolescent health care visits  Because of the current shortage of vaccine  check with your health care provider to discuss your need for vaccination           For further information about meningococcal meningitis and vaccination             Contact your physician or student
