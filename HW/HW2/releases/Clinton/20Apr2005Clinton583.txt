April 20  2005 Senator Clinton Meets With Secretary Nicholson to Advocate for New York  s VA Hospitals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Senator Clinton Meets With Secretary Nicholson to Advocate for New York  s VA Hospitals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Veterans   Affairs Secretary R  James Nicholson yesterday to express her concerns regarding the next phase of VA CARES and called for a fully transparent process that will provide New York  s veterans with a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard   The Senator also called on the Secretary to support guaranteed funding for VA health care to ensure our men and women in uniform have access to the healthcare services they need and deserve        At the meeting  Senator Clinton invited the Secretary to visit VA hospitals in New York and secured his commitment that he would consider her concerns on several key issues in the ongoing debate about the future of the facilities in Canandaigua  Montrose and Manhattan         As I have explained previously during the CARES initiative  I have serious concerns regarding the process by which the VA decided to make changes in New York facilities   During this next phase in the process  I must underline how absolutely essential it is that the VA  s planning process for the Canandaigua  Montrose  Castle Point  Manhattan and Brooklyn VA  s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York  s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process     Senator Clinton said in a letter to the Secretary further outlining these critical issues         Mr  Secretary  as you know  our nation s veterans have served their country with distinction  Our nation made a pact with those who serve their country in the Armed Forces   a commitment that those who served would have access to quality health care through the VA hospital system  The men and women who served our country are the best this nation has to offer  and they deserve to be treated as the best   We need to be there with open arms when our veterans come home  and we must continue to stand with them over the years         Throughout her time in the Senate  Senator Clinton has been working hard to protect the interests of New York veterans    to provide full funding for veterans  health care  to make mandatory the funding of VA health care  and to keep New York VA hospitals open       Please see the attached letter sent to Secretary Nicholson      April 19  2005       The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary  United States Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W   Washington  D C   20420       Dear Mr  Secretary        I would like to congratulate you on your appointment as Secretary of the Veterans Administration and to thank you for taking the time to meet with me today regarding a number of veterans issues important to New Yorkers   I have outlined some of the critical veterans   issues the Senate will be addressing during the 109th Congress   I have raised several of these issues with your predecessor  former secretary Anthony Principi  to whom I was always able to communicate the views and concerns of New York  s veterans   I look forward to working with you toward our common goal    providing veterans with the highest quality health care        You assume your duties as secretary in the midst of a critical debate in Congress regarding the future of veterans   health care  and at a point in time when many New Yorkers are particularly concerned with the outcome of the Veterans Administration  s  VA  Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  initiative        VA CARES INITIATIVE       As I have explained previously during the CARES initiative  I have serious concerns regarding the process by which the VA decided to make changes in New York facilities   I must underline how absolutely essential it is that during this next phase in the process  the VA  s planning process for the Canandaigua  Montrose  Castle Point  Manhattan and Brooklyn VA  s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York  s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process        a  VA  s National CARES Decision Document  VA Decision Document   The May 2004 VA Decision Document incorporated some of the changes advocated by New York  s veterans  and my colleagues and I who represent New York   At the same time  the Decision Document did not heed a number of concerns I had raised regarding several recommendations that would seriously affect New York  s who receive care at the Canandaigua  Montrose  Castle Point  and Manhattan VA hospitals        b  Canandaigua  Montrose and Castle Point VA  s  I implore you to keep VA facilities in Canandaigua   The veterans of New York achieved a remarkable victory in former Secretary Principi  s decision to keep VA facilities in Canandaigua   As the VA considers the details of future Canandaigua facilities  veteran and stakeholder input will be vital        I continue to be deeply concerned that the Decisions Document directs movement of inpatient beds from the Canandaigua VA to facilities in Syracuse and Buffalo  and from the Montrose VA to Castle Point  apparently without the VA having completed its strategic planning process for long term care and mental health care   In the absence of strategic plans  proceeding with these changes at New York  s facilities calls into question the VA  s commitment to follow congressionally expressed intent regarding CARES   As the result of the introduction of the Clinton Enzi CARES amendment to the Fiscal Year 2004 Senate VA HUD appropriations bill  the House Senate conferees specifically stated in the Fiscal Year 2004 Consolidated Appropriations conference report that they   are concerned that the realignment recommendations of the CARES Commission may lead to a reduction in long term care  domiciliary care  and mental health services   The VA is expected to expedite the strategic planning process for these services   Based on the Secretary  s statements the conferees urge that no closures or reduction in long term care  domiciliary care  and mental health services  will take place until the full analysis is completed      In addition  in November 2003  former Secretary Principi pledged   no net reduction in VA  s capacity to provide inpatient mental health and long term care prior to completion of a comprehensive assessment of veterans   need for these services           c  Manhattan VA  I am strongly opposed to the potential closure of the Manhattan VA and consolidation with the Brooklyn VA campus   Therefore  I opposed the Decision Document  s call for the VA to complete a   feasibility study    for the consolidation of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA campuses        As I have said on previous occasions  it would be a grave error to close the Manhattan VA   The Manhattan VA contains six tertiary care specialties that the VA has designated as centers of excellence   The Prosthetic and Orthotic Laboratory has a unique role in the region in producing artificial limbs   The relationship between New York University School of Medicine  NYUSM  and the Manhattan VA that helps to make possible the high quality of health care at the hospital would be imperiled         In addition  the practical matter of transportation deserves great weight in the VA  s deliberations   The high quality tertiary services at the Manhattan VA attract veterans from New York  and other states including New Jersey and Pennsylvania   One of the reasons the Manhattan VA is able to serve these veterans is its amazing accessibility  located  as it is  in the heart of Manhattan  at the center of a mass transit system that is unmatched anywhere else in the nation   Further  the Manhattan VA can serve to provide vital surge capacity in the event of an emergency        d  PricewaterhouseCoopers Federal Advisory Committee Process  Given how essential transparency is during this phase of the CARES process  I would appreciate receiving copies of whatever written guidance has been provided by the VA to PricewaterhouseCoopers  the contractor retained to oversee the planning studies for the VA  and to the local Federal Advisory Committees  FAC  s  formed to assist the process   Again  I cannot stress strongly enough how essential it is that transparency and full and fair community involvement be part of the process from beginning to end   With the full involvement of the community in these decisions  the VA will help to maximize the possibility that that our veterans will get the highest quality health care they deserve        As PricewaterhouseCoopers and the FAC  s proceed with their work  they should keep in mind that legislation was included as part of the Veterans Health Programs Improvement Act of 2004 that requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to notify Congress before implementing a major mission change at the Manhattan VA medical facility   The notice to Congress must include an assessment of the effect of the mission change on the population of veterans served by the facility  a description of the availability and quality of health care  including long term care  mental health care  and substance abuse programs  available in the area served by the facility  an assessment of the effect of the mission change on the economy of the community in which the facility is located  and an analysis of any alternatives to the mission change proposed by the community in which the facility is located  by specified other groups  or by the Department of Veterans Affairs          ADDITIONAL VA HEALTH CARE ISSUES       a  Guaranteed VA Health Care Funding  I urge you to support guaranteed funding for VA health care   During this Congressional session  I have cosponsored Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Ranking Member Daniel Akaka  s S  13  Fulfilling Our Duty to America s Veterans Act of 2005   I also cosponsored legislation in the 108th Congress that would have guaranteed funding   As we enter the Fiscal Year 2006 appropriations cycle  I will work with my colleagues on this vital initiative        b  Fiscal Year 2006 Budgeting for VA Health Care  I also urge you to support full funding for VA health care in Fiscal Year 2006  FY06   As you know  in March the Senate debated the budget for veterans   health care for FY06   I voted for an amendment that passed and added  410 million in additional funding for veterans health care   However  I was disappointed that a separate amendment    allocating approximately  2 8 billion for VA medical care    was defeated   The adoption of that amendment would have helped to avert potential cuts in services and staff  shorten waiting times for care and benefits  and provide much needed assistance to veterans nationwide        c  Prescription Drug Co Pays and Enrollment Fees  I supported the amendment to add approximately  2 8 billion because it would have helped to ensure that Priority 7 and Priority 8 veterans are not forced to pay an enrollment fee or an approximate doubling of co payments for prescription drugs        d  State Veterans Homes  The  2 8 billionmendment would also have helped to sustain the VA  s commitment to support state veterans homes in New York and nationwide   Last year  Congress provided a helping hand to state veterans homes through legislation that I cosponsored and which passed as part of the Veterans Health Programs Improvement Act of 2004        That legislation clarified that per diem payments by the Department of Veterans Affairs for the care of veterans in state veterans homes shall not be used to offset or reduce other payments made to assist veterans   The intent of that provision was to permit more VA funding to remain with state veterans homes such as those in New York State  in order to enhance care for veterans   I have seen first hand how that funding can be put to good use   In September 2004  I visited the Long Island State Veterans Home in Stony Brook  LISVH  and spent time with its staff and residents   I witnessed the high quality of care these veterans are afforded        Therefore  I was very disappointed to learn that the Administration  s budget request sought authority to   prioritize    among veterans and essentially limit VA per diem payments to state nursing homes by priority group   The challenge presented by the Administration  s proposal was outlined in stark relief yesterday at an event on Long Island highlighting challenges facing military families  At the event  we heard from a representative of LISVH   According to LISVH  the proposal to restrict eligibility for VA per diem payments would result in the loss of millions of dollars in funding for LISVH  a devastating blow to LISVH that would threaten its very existence        e  VA Mental Health Care  Increased funding for VA mental health care is a priority of mine and I was disappointed that the Senate did not adopt an amendment to the Iraq Afghanistan Supplemental bill that would have added nearly  2 billion for veterans   health care needs  including more than  500 million for mental health care   A study published in July 2004 in The New England Journal of Medicine indicates that that more than 15  of soldiers and marines returning from Iraq may be at risk  by virtue of their brave and heroic service  of developing a mental health disorder such as post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  or major depression   I know you agree that we owe it to all our veterans that the mental health care they need is available        Mr  Secretary  as you know  our nation s veterans have served their country with distinction   Our nation made a pact with those who serve their country in the Armed Forces    a commitment that those who served would have access to quality health care through the VA hospital system   The men and women who served our country are the best this nation has to offer  and they deserve to be treated as the best   We need to be there with open arms when our veterans come home  and we must continue to stand with them over the years        Thank you again for the constructive meeting we had today  I look forward to working with you on behalf of the veterans of New York  and on behalf of the veterans around this Nation who are depending on us to keep the commitment our Nation has made to them        Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
