October 20  2005 Clinton Legislation to Crack Down on Sex Offenders Approved by Key Senate Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    The Senate Judiciary Committee today approved legislation cosponsored by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton that would overhaul our country  s sex offender laws  creating important new protections for New York  s families and communities   The bill  the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act  now moves to the Senate floor for consideration            This legislation takes important steps to stop sexual predators in their tracks by putting real teeth in registration requirements     said Senator Clinton     We need to do everything we can to help protect the next child from being a victim and I will work to speed passage of this important bill on the Senate floor             Today  there are over 550 000 registered sex offenders in the United States and more than 20 000 in New York   Unfortunately  too many convicted sex offenders receive and serve limited prison sentences and too many are able to live among the general public unchecked and unknown to their communities            The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act would place the responsibility on sex offenders to register with local authorities and require them to notify those authorities when they move or change jobs   For the first time  sex offenders would be required to register in person and the bill would make it a felony to fail to register  a step up from current New York law which makes it a misdemeanor the first time a sex offender fails to register   The bill would set national minimum standards for classifying sex offenders  a big step toward eliminating the lag time in classification and registration that occurs when sex offenders move across state lines   The legislation also requires states to put tier 2 and 3 sex offenders on both state and the national sex offender databases  and makes public for the first time the National Sex Offender Registry  NSOR   which currently is only accessible by law enforcement   The NSOR was created by the Clinton Administration to make it easier to apprehend sex offenders   The bill also provides  10 million in grants to states for electronic monitoring of sex offenders and it increases penalties for committing sexual offenses against a minor   According to the Department of Justice  child molesters serve  on average  only 43  of their sentences   The bill also ensures that the civil confinement of sexual predators  in accordance with state law  is an available option          Companion legislation is currently being considered in the United States House of Representatives  sponsored by Representative Mark Foley  FL           Senator Clinton is also a co sponsor of the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Database Act of 2005 or Dru s Law  which would make the National Sex Offender Registry publicly available via the Internet   Dru s law passed the Senate in late July and is pending consideration in the House
