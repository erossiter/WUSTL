February 5  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Reported Drop in Cooling Water at Indian Point Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This latest incident at Indian Point appears to have been resolved   But I believe it underscores the need for an Independent Safety Assessment at the plant  and I will soon reintroduce legislation to require one   Many of my colleagues agree with me that an ISA is essential and while we have not yet been able to persuade the Bush Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to undertake one  I believe that in this new Democratic Congress we will achieve that goal   I think that continued public confidence in the facility will depend on a much closer look at how Indian Point is run  and I will be working to make that happen
