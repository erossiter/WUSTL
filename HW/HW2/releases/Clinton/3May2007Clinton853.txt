May 3  2007 Senators Schumer and Clinton Secure Commitment on Generic Versions of Biologic Medications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that they have secured a commitment that the FDA Revitalization Act  currently under consideration on the Senate floor  will include a pathway for the FDA to approve generic versions of biologic medications before it is sent to the President later this year   In making this commitment  Senator Edward Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  HELP  committee    which has jurisdiction over the bill and of which Senator Clinton is a member    announced that legislation on follow on biologics will receive a mark up in the HELP Committee on June 13           Biologics treat some of the most devastating diseases around and no one should be denied access to them because they re too expensive   said Senator Schumer   Today s news is a significant step toward providing safe and affordable generic biologics drugs   It is high time for these vital treatments to become more affordable   our legislation is just what the doctor ordered            We must provide the FDA with the authority and flexibility to approve biopharmaceuticals subject to a workable  abbreviated approval pathway that is efficient  effective  and scientifically grounded  We must also include measures to ensure timely resolution of patent disputes as well as adequate incentives for continued innovation   said Senator Clinton on the Senate floor            Senators Schumer and Clinton in February joined with Representative Henry Waxman to introduce the  Access to Life Saving Medicine Act   which would give the FDA the express legal authority to approve safe  lower cost copies of biotech drugs  also known as biologics or biopharmaceuticals   Biotech drugs  which are produced from living cell cultures rather than being synthesized chemically  are among the fastest growing and most expensive components of the nation s drug bill   Currently there is no statutory pathway for generic versions of biotech drugs to enter the market  even after all patents have expired   As a result  the manufacturers of biotech drugs can charge monopoly prices  indefinitely             Patients who rely on biologic drugs spend as much as tens of thousands of dollars a year  yet there is currently no clear pathway for lower cost competitors to enter the market  as there is for generic versions of traditional chemical drugs   Biologic drugs are at the cutting edge of treatment  and it s time our regulations caught up   said Senator Schumer           In 1984 when the Waxman Hatch drug law was written  very few biologic drugs existed and there wasn t any need at that time to empower the FDA to approve lower cost versions of existing biologic drugs  This  as we know  is no longer the case  and it is time to enact legislation that will allow the FDA to approve safe and effective follow on versions of biotech drugs   noted Senator Clinton on the Senate floor          Biotech drugs can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year  imposing financial burdens on patients  employers  insurers  and federal and state governments   The  Access to Life Saving Medicine Act  would authorize FDA to approve abbreviated applications for biological products that are  comparable  to previously approved brand name biological products and it gives the FDA the authority to require any additional clinical information it deems necessary
