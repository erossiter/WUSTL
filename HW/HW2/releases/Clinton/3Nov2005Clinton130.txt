November 3  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Budget Reconciliation Bill  s Misplaced Priorities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    In its total  the Republican budget represents a set of priorities that I believe are inconsistent with this government  s responsibilities and obligations to the American people           Unfortunately  Democratic efforts to make this a bill that reflected the values of the American people were repeatedly defeated  Requiring full offsets for all spending and tax cuts so as not to exacerbate our record budget deficits and national debt were shot down   Our proposal to ensure the protection of one of the most sensitive environmental areas in the U S  Alaskan National Wildlife Refuge from the oil industry was turned back   Our efforts to extend expanded Medicaid coverage to the thousands of victims of Hurricane Katrina was stopped in its tracks           While the proponents of this budget will claim that their proposal is a solid step forward in reducing the deficit  in reality what they will only achieve is the partial financing of their tax cut agenda on the backs of seniors on Medicare  those living in poverty on Medicaid and low income housing residents   And who finances the rest of this agenda   The fact is that when all is said and done  the entire Republican budget package will actually increase the budget deficit by  30 billion            As gas prices have soared  and working families continue to struggle to fill their tanks with skyrocketing home heating bills on the horizon  does the Republican leadership ask the oil conglomerates who have just reported record profits to shoulder some of the burden in providing heating assistance for the poor and elderly   No  they actually make sure that the oil companies can continue to offer higher dividends to their share holders and give them access to ANWR            As the gap between rich and poor continues to grow  does the Republican leadership ask the wealthiest Americans to forgo a small portion of their tax cut   No  they simply cut spending for health care  education and environmental protection with one hand and dish out an additional  70 billion in deficit financed tax cuts with the other            As the national debt has grown to unprecedented levels  does the Republican leadership put forward fiscally responsible proposals to reduce the deficit or pay down the debt which is increasingly being held by foreign nations like China and Japan   No  in fact  under this budget  in five years the national debt will exceed  11 trillion            Democrats know what a real deficit reduction and economic growth package looks like   It requires shared sacrifice and the moral courage to make tough decisions    And we know what good can be achieved through those difficult choices   This is evidenced by the 22 million jobs created  the largest budget surpluses on record and the longest economic growth on record the last time we took the initiative to get our fiscal house in order            What is clear from this budget is that the Senate can and must do better for the American people   We need a budget that reflects the priorities and values that have made this Nation great and  simply put  this budget failed that test miserably
