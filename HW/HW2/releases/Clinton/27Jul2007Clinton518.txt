July 27  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Approval of Bill Enacting 9 11 Commission Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement on Senate approval of the 9 11 Commission recommendations conference report   The bill now heads to the Presidents desk to be signed into law    I am proud that  under Democratic leadership  the Senate has finally approved the remaining recommendations of the 9 11 Commission   Enacting the 9 11 Commission s recommendations is a long overdue step forward for our national and homeland security   I would also like to praise the persistence and hard work of the families of the victims of September 11th whose resolve led to the creation of the 9 11 Commission    This bill addresses vulnerabilities we still face more than six years after 9 11   It ensures that precious homeland security funds will be allocated more on the basis of risk and increases funding for high threat urban areas like New York City   It provides critically needed funding to finally ensure emergency communications between our first responders are interoperable so responders can talk to each other when a crisis strikes   It finally funds the grant program I secured in law in 2004 to upgrade our 911 emergency response systems  which in too many areas can not pinpoint the location of incoming calls made from cell phones or internet based phone systems   And it steps up inspections of cargo  a critical vulnerability in our homeland security  so that 100 percent scanning will be required before cargo comes into the United States      These are real steps forward for our safety and security and I hope the President will act quickly to sign this bill into law
