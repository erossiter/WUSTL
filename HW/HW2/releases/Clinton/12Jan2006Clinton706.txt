rates located in pockets of unincorporated areas  Sen  Clinton has introduced the Suburban Core Opportunity  Restoration and Enhancement Act to provide economic and tax incentives to help suburban areas revitalize their neighborhoods  create employment opportunities  develop affordable housing and expand business opportunities        The senator also addressed the need for the passage of the

suburban affluence          The only way we can meet the rising demand for community services confronting us on Long Island is to do what we are currently doing more efficiently  to work together collaboratively  cross sectorally in new ways for Long Island  s future and overcome the fragmentation that too often divides us     said Gallagher          United Way of Long Island is changing     said John Durso  president of Long Island Federation of Labor  AFL CIO    And  it  s changing significantly  Its mission is not focused solely on raising money  although funds raised increased 15 percent last year  It is to improve people  s lives and create lasting change in our community  We are proud to partner with U S  Sen  Hillary Rodham Clinton  United Way of Long Island and the Long
