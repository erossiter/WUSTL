                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Bill to Create National Commission on Infrastructure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    Today  U S  Senators George V  Voinovich  OH   Thomas Carper  DE  and Hillary R  Clinton  NY  introduced the National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2006  legislation created to address the deteriorating conditions of our nation  s roads  bridges  drinking water systems  dams and other public works   If enacted  the bill will establish a National Commission on Infrastructure of the United States   The commission will be charged with aiding in the nation  s economic growth and ensuring the ability of the nation  s infrastructure to meet current and future demands            The tragedy of Hurricane Katrina made painfully clear the dire need for improvements to our aging infrastructure   The deterioration of our nation  s waterways and infrastructure systems are impacting our economy  the environment  and the welfare of the American people   The economic benefits of infrastructure projects speak for themselves   Right now  our infrastructure is collapsing due to insufficient funding     said Sen  Voinovich     This legislation gets at the heart of the problem by establishing a commission that will provide concrete recommendations for future infrastructure needs   It has gained broad support from many different organizations  such as the U S  Conference of Mayors  the National Association of Counties  and the U S  Chamber of Commerce   If enacted  this commission will lead the way in providing long term solutions to the current problems we face today                The future health of our economy depends upon the proper investment in infrastructure  whether we are talking about transportation  water supply  wastewater treatment or levees     said Sen  Carper     No nation can be successful without these fundamental building blocks   As we look for the best way to address the future needs of our country in light of tighter and tighter budgets  we need to ensure that we can properly maintain our current infrastructure and set targeted priorities for future investments                Our nation  s economic strength throughout history has been inexorably linked to the investments made in our public infrastructure   From the Transcontinental Railroad to the National Highway System  the public sector  s investments in our roads  our waterways  our railways and our aviation systems have defined the bedrock strengths of the American economy and its people    We need to ensure that we continue to make the right investments to rebuild and strengthen our aging infrastructure to ensure our nation  s future prosperity   The consequences of ignoring this challenge will be staggering   This bipartisan legislation will help foster the consensus needed to move forward and enact the bold proposals necessary to ensure the viability of our nation  s infrastructure     said Sen  Clinton          This legislation is the first important step in revitalizing our nation  s weakening infrastructure  Hurricane Katrina made evident the serious need for the repair and improvement of our nation  s aging infrastructure and waterway systems   The backlog of unfunded Army Corps of Engineers operation and maintenance projects mandated by Congress is  1 2 billion   This is up from  250 million when Senator Voinovich arrived in the Senate in 1999          The bill would mandate                      Establishment of the National Commission on the Infrastructure of the United States to ensure that the nation  s infrastructure meets current and future demands and facilitates economic growth                       Completion of a study by February 2009 that will address all matters relating to the state of the nation  s infrastructure  including capacity of infrastructure improvements to sustain current and anticipated economic development  the age  condition and capacity of public infrastructure  repair and maintenance needs  financing methods and investment requirements                       Development of recommendations for a federal plan outlining infrastructure priorities  and                      Completion of a report to Congress by February 2009 that will detail infrastructure legislation deemed necessary for the next five  15  30 and 50 years
