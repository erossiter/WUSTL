December 1  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on World AIDS Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   Today  on World AIDS Day  let us remember the millions of people who have died  Let us keep in our thoughts and prayers the 33 million living with HIV around the world and the more than one million Americans living with the disease here at home  And let us renew our commitment as individuals and a nation to fighting this disease by caring for those in need  by helping countries torn apart by the epidemic  by combating the dangerous stigma that often still exists  by working to prevent new infections and by investing in research into treatments and an eventual cure  I will continue to stand up for policies in the Senate that reflect the scope and urgency of the AIDS epidemic  Our needs are growing  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently estimates that 40 000 Americans are infected with HIV every year  a number expected to rise as the CDC accounts for increases in infection rates   It is critical that our response keeps pace   I will continue to fight for greater funding for the Ryan White program and other initiatives to help people living with the disease in America   And I will work to overcome the veto of the Labor  Health and Human Services Appropriations Bill by President Bush that puts ideology ahead of funding for prevention and treatment  Over the next year  we have the opportunity to strengthen and reform the President s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  known as PEPFAR  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to ensure this program increases access to treatment and care in those countries hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic  As a first step  I plan to introduce in the Senate the Protection Against HIV Transmission for Women and Youth  PATHWAY  Act  It is time to develop a new strategy to address the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV in our country and around the world  and end the ideological requirement that demands one third of all prevention funding be spent on scientifically unfounded abstinence only programs  We cannot allow ideology to stand in the way of the smartest  best policies to stem the tide of this epidemic  Communities must be able to implement programs that address their specific needs  Lives are on the line  Today s theme is Stop AIDS  Keep the Promise  Every one of us can help keep that promise in our families  communities  and country  Every one of us can live up to our values and respond to the AIDS crisis with the compassion  commitment  and urgency required
