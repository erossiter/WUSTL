April 25  2005 Senator Clinton Meets With Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff  Calls Upon Him to Strengthen Homeland Security Efforts Throughout State                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Clinton Urges Commitment to Threat Based Funding   Asks Chertoff to Support Creation of a Northern Border Coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     New York  NY   At a meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  specifically called upon the Secretary to champion threat and risk based funding for all Homeland Security Programs and urged support for her efforts to create a Northern Border Coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security   Following the meeting  Senator Clinton joined Secretary Chertoff  Senator Chuck Schumer  NY  and Mayor Michael Bloomberg for a briefing on rail safety at Grand Central Station          I have long advocated for better coordination on Northern Border security  both within U S  government agencies and between the U S  and Canada   A Northern Border Coordinator would ensure that we have measures in place to increase the security of our border and the ports of entry along the border     said Senator Clinton     I hope Secretary Chertoff will support the need for this critical position             On funding  Senator Clinton urged Chertoff to ensure that the Northern Border receives the necessary level of resources to provide ample staffing and to implement technological advances as soon as possible   The Senator also reiterated her call for Secretary Chertoff to champion the use of threat and risk based formulas to allocate homeland security funding to local communities  states and first responders   Senator Clinton stated that while she recognized that Secretary Chertoff has stated support for threat based funding  actions speak louder than words            I raise this issue because on a number of occasions  then Secretary Ridge had acknowledged the need for threat and risk based funding  but there was little evidence of any significant effort on the part of the Administration to push for the use of a better funding formula     Senator Clinton said     I hope that you will use all resources and authority available to you to implement threat and risk based funding in all the homeland security programs intended for our local governments and states  From rail safety to port security to protecting our borders  we have much work to do   but we should all be able to agree on one thing   failure to act is simply not an option           The following is a copy of a letter Senator Clinton gave to Secretary Chertoff this morning addressing threat based funding and Northern Border concerns          April 25  2005       The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C   20528         Dear Mr  Secretary        It was good to meet with you prior to your confirmation and I look forward to continuing our discussion on how to work to help make New York  s and our nation  s homeland defense as strong as possible          I wanted to follow up on a number of issues that I raised in my February 15 letter to you as well as some additional issues       I           Threat Based Funding    I have long championed the need to use threat and risk based formulas for the allocation of critical homeland security funding to our local communities  states  and first responders   I know that you agree with the need to allocate these resources in this way  and are aware that President Bush  s proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2006 called for threat and risk based funding for the State Homeland Security Grant Program  SHSG    While that is a positive step  I also hope that you will use all resources and authority available to you to implement threat and risk based funding in all the homeland security programs intended for our local governments and states           I raise this because on a number of occasions  Secretary Ridge had acknowledged the need for threat and risk based funding  but there was little evidence of any significant effort on the part of the Administration to push for the use of a better funding formula   Indeed  it was the Department of Homeland Security that initially chose to allocate resources in the SHSG Program based on population alone   Unfortunately  Congressional appropriators  in Fiscal Year 2005  required the use of a formula that was based on population alone  just as the Department of Homeland Security affirmatively chose to do in Fiscal Year 2004          I hope that the Fiscal Year 2006 appropriations legislation will contain no such language   I will again call upon the appropriators to do what is in the best interest of homeland defense and not require a population based formula  but  at the end of the day  it will require significant leadership on your part specifically  and the Bush Administration in general  to encourage Senate and House leadership to propose a homeland security appropriations bill that reflects threats         II         Northern Border Concerns    Last week  I introduced legislation establishing a Northern Border Coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security   I hope you will support this legislation   For too long  Northern Border security has received the short end of the stick when it comes to federal resources   While we have made some progress in increasing resources along the border  much more needs to be done  That is why I have long advocated for better coordination on Northern Border security  both within U S  government agencies and between the U S  and Canada          My bill would establish the position of Northern Border Coordinator within the Directorate of Border and Transportation Security of the Department of Homeland Security  Specifically  the Northern Border Coordinator would be responsible for devising and implementing measures to increase the security of the border between the United States and Canada and the ports of entry located along the border  improving the coordination between the agencies responsible for that security  serving as the primary liaison with state and local governments and law enforcement agencies regarding security along the border between the U S  and Canada  and serving as a liaison with the Canadian government on border security         The recent announcement about a passport requirement for crossing the border demonstrates the need for a Northern Border Coordinator   A Northern Border Coordinator  acting as a liaison with border communities  could have raised a red flag about the impact of this requirement on border communities           Because of the importance of this issue  as a follow up to my April 15 letter to you and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  I want to reiterate my concerns with respect to the April 5  2005  announcement by the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State that would require United States and Canadian citizens to utilize a passport to enter the U S  from Canada         According to that announcement  the Departments of State and Homeland Security are pursuing a  Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  that would  require all U S  citizens  Canadians  citizens of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda  and citizens of Mexico to have a passport or other accepted secure document to enter or re enter the U S  by January 1  2008   The media note also states that other documents may be determined to be acceptable  including  the Customs and Border Protection Secure Electronic Network for Travelers Rapid Inspection  SENTRI   NEXUS and Free and Secure Trade  FAST  program cards          President Bush subsequently expressed surprise that U S  citizens would be required to show a passport and has directed that a review of the initiative be undertaken to determine whether there are alternatives   While President Bush reportedly referred to the large number of crossings that would be affected in his home state of Texas  I can attest to the equally profound impact on the State of New York         National security and  in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount and I have made security at New York s Northern Border a top priority since September 11  2001   However  it is crucial that any new requirement be sensitive to the potentially serious impact of this proposal on tourism and the regional economy   I would again urge that the Department of Homeland Security  along with the State Department  consider this proposal very carefully and take into account the concerns of the business and residential communities along New York s Northern Border         I also hope that you will work to ensure the Northern Border receives the necessary level of attention and resources to provide ample staffing and to implement technological advances at the earliest possible time   This is especially important because the Northern Border has traditionally not received enough federal resources or attention   Through large annual increases in border patrol agents and other initiatives  I am convinced that it is possible to enhance border security  while facilitating the binational trade and tourism between Canada and the U S  that so many of my constituents depend on for their livelihood         Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
