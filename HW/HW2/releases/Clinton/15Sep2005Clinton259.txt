September 15  2005 Clinton Renews Concerns Over U S Border Passport Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Calls on Colleagues in Congress to prevent funds from going to Administration Initiative before proposal fully considered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on her colleagues in Congress to prevent funds going to a Bush Administration initiative to require passports at U S  borders  The Senator made her concerns known in a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Senate and House Appropriations Subcommittees on Appropriation  who are currently considering the FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill and have the ability to prevent funds from going to the initiative            National security  and in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount   I have made security at New York  s northern border a top priority since joining the Senate   However  it is crucial that any new requirement be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism and the regional economy   There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers that this passport requirement would devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border     Senator Clinton wrote in her letter              Based on the immediate and dramatic response of border state residents in New York and other states to the announcement of the passport initiative several months ago  it is imperative that Congress require the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to listen closely to the voices of border state residents and consider all feasible alternatives that will both enhance security and facilitate commerce     Senator Clinton wrote          On September 1  2005  the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  announced they would be formally submitting the   Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative    for public comment   Although the Initiative has been altered to come into effect by the end of 2006 and the Department has indicated that other documents issued under various programs designed to speed border crossings will be considered  according to the DHS release announcing the comment period    the passport will be the document of choice for travel within the Western Hemisphere or re entry             Senator Clinton has expressed her serious concerns about the   Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative    since it was first previewed in April of this year  The Senator has written to both Secretary of State Rice and Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff and met with Secretary Chertoff on this critical issue          September 9  2005         Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members          As you confer on the FY06 Homeland Security Appropriations bill  I write to urge your support for inclusion of Senate Amendment 1111  sponsored by Senator Dorgan and adopted in the Senate by unanimous consent on July 14  2005  in the final conference report           This amendment addresses the proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  Initiative  planned by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    The Initiative would require all United States citizens  Canadians  citizens of the British Overseas Territory of Bermuda  and citizens of Mexico to have a passport or other accepted secure document to enter or re enter the United States   The Dorgan Amendment which passed the Senate would direct that no appropriated funds under the Act can be used to promulgate regulations to implement the Initiative              National security  and in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount   I have made security at New York  s northern border a top priority since joining the Senate   However  it is crucial that any new requirement be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism and the regional economy   There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers that this passport requirement would devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border             On April 16  2005  the Washington Post reported that President Bush expressed surprise that U S  citizens would be required to show a passport and directed that a review of the DHS initiative be undertaken to determine whether there are alternatives   While President Bush reportedly referred to the large number of crossings that would be affected in his home state of Texas  I can attest to the equally profound impact on New York State           Notwithstanding  on September 1  2005  DHS announced they are moving ahead by formally submitting the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative for public comment   Although the Initiative has been altered to come into effect a year later  by the end of 2006  and other documents issued under various programs designed to speed border crossings will be considered  according to the DHS release   the passport will be the document of choice for travel within the Western Hemisphere or re entry              The Dorgan Amendment would ensure that proper consideration is given to the impact of any new requirements on regional economies  and that a full review is conducted of acceptable alternatives   While we must do everything in our power to secure our nation  we must also take into account the very real concerns of business and residential communities along the border regarding the impact on commercial  tourist and personal traffic           Based on the immediate and dramatic response of border state residents in New York and other states to the announcement of the passport initiative several months ago  it is imperative that Congress require the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State to listen closely to the voices of border state residents and consider all feasible alternatives that will both enhance security and facilitate commerce             Thank you for your consideration          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
