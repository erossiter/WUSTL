June 29  2005 Senator Clinton Praises Passage of Adult Stem Cell Bill  Urges Expansion of Embryonic Stem Cell Research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Clinton hailed the unanimous approval by a key Senate panel today of the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005  legislation she co sponsored that will expand access to adult stem cell therapies like cord blood and bone marrow transplantation   In praising approval of the bill  Senator Clinton underscored the need to also expand access to embryonic stem cell research and urged support for pending legislation she has co sponsored to achieve this goal         Cord blood cells hold immense promise for treatment of leukemia  lymphoma  sickle cell anemia and other blood disorders  and this bill will help make lifesaving treatments available to thousands of Americans     said Senator Clinton     This legislation is an important step  but to realize the full potential of stem cell research  we also need to lift the Bush Administration  s choke hold on scientists struggling to pursue the promise of embryonic stem cell research   I will work in the Senate to pass legislation that will achieve this goal while ensuring that this research adheres to the highest ethical standards            The Bush Administration has prohibited research on any embryonic stem cell lines created after August 9  2001   Federally funded scientists are limited to performing research on approximately 20 stem cell lines  not all of which are suitable for research   The limited number of cells available for federal funding is hindering research into many chronic  debilitating and fatal conditions  hurting millions of Americans living with Parkinson  s  Alzheimer  s and diabetes among others         On stem cell research  the Bush Administration is yet again putting ideology over science  limiting our ability to discover new treatments for debilitating diseases     Senator Clinton emphasized     Without access to federal funds for embryonic stem cell research  our scientists are falling behind as researchers in South Korea and other countries make advances that our scientists simply cannot          Senator Clinton has co sponsored S  471  which would allow research on stem cell lines derived from embryos created for fertility treatments and voluntarily donated by parents   She is also a co sponsor of S  876  which sets up an ethical framework for stem cell research while setting forth a clear  unequivocal ban on human cloning   Both of these bills have the support of Senators on both sides of the aisle committed to speeding the progress of medical research and Senator Clinton will work with her colleagues to help pass this legislation this Congress
