March 6  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Libby Verdict                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    While justice has been served in the Libby case  the real lesson to come from it is that we must be vigilant in ensuring that the intelligence on burgeoning threats to our nation is beyond reproach   Clearly  the Bush Administration wasn t forthcoming about the intelligence failures leading up to the war in Iraq and as a result damaged the country s credibility   We need to ensure that our intelligence is accurate  reliable and free of political influence
