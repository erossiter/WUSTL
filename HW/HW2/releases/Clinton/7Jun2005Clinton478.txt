June 7  2005 Senate Panel Approves Clinton Legislation  to Help Prevent a Dirty Bomb Attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Clinton Presses for Action on Back Up Power for Nuclear Power Plants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee today approved legislation introduced last month by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  to strengthen safeguards on radioactive materials that could be used to make a dirty bomb  The Senate panel included the major provisions of Senator Clinton s bill  the Dirty Bomb Prevention Act  in the Nuclear Security Act of 2005  comprehensive legislation that will now go to the Senate floor          In the wake of the tragedy of 9 11  we must be doing everything we can to make our State and our country more secure  One of the things we need to do is keep radioactive material out the hands of terrorists to prevent them from making a dirty bomb   said Senator Clinton   I am pleased that my legislation to fill gaps in our current dirty bomb prevention efforts won approval today by a key Senate Committee  and I hope the Senate addresses this critical bill soon  By passing this legislation  we can do a better job of controlling radioactive material so it does not fall into the hands of those who wish to do us harm          Radiation sources are numerous in the United States and not all radiological materials are subject to federal oversight  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  reports that about 157 000 general and specific licenses have been issued authorizing the use of radioactive materials for industrial  medical  and other uses  About 1 8 million devices containing radioactive sources have been distributed under these licenses  A 2003 GAO report found that since 1998  there have been more than 1 300 incidents where radiation sources were lost  stolen or abandoned  While not all of these sources and incidents present potential dirty bomb threats  it is clear evidence that we need to improve oversight of radioactive materials         The legislation approved today aims to correct serious deficiencies in security by taking immediate action to close gaps in our control and oversight of these materials  The legislation gives the NRC the authority and mandate to provide oversight of Radium 226 and other naturally occurring radiological materials that have historically remained outside of federal control  Radium 226 is of particular concern  The Department of Energy considers it one of the top ten isotopes of concern for use in a dirty bomb  and it is on the list of radiation sources that the United States has agreed to control as part of adhering to the International Atomic Energy Agency Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources  However  it remains in the public domain and outside of the federal regulatory net  Radium 226 was used in medicine starting early in the 20th century  increasing in use until the 1950s when there were more than 5 000 radium users in the U S         The legislation would also require the NRC within six months to enact a  cradle to grave  tracking system to ensure that we know the location of all radiation sources of concern at all times  The bill also requires the establishment of import and export controls for radiation sources so that we know what is coming into and leaving our country as part of our efforts to control these materials         Finally  the bill includes forward looking measures to help reduce our risks  The bill directs the Academy of Sciences to conduct an assessment of whether some current industrial uses of radiation could be replaced with non radioactive or less dangerous radioactive materials and creates an interagency task force on radiation source protection that will provide recommendations to Congress and the NRC on the safety and security of radiation sources        Senator Clinton today also pressed the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate panel to address the recent decision by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  not to mandate emergency response backup power systems for emergency sirens at New York s and the nation s nuclear power plants  Senator Clinton has urged that the NRC to require that each commercial reactor licensee ensure that emergency notification systems that are in place to notify nearby residents of an emergency at the plant would work in the event of a power failure  At today s meeting  Senator Clinton secured a commitment from EPW Chairman Inhofe to work towards including a provision to address the backup power issue in the Nuclear Security Act of 2005 when it moves to the Senate floor  In the absence of such legislation or NRC action  emergency sirens at New York s nuclear power plants  including Ginna  Indian Point  James A  Fitzpatrick  and Nine Mile Point  will remain unequipped with backup sources of power
