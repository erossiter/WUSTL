March 16  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Great Lakes Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    The Great Lakes are not only national treasures  they are vital economic tools for the communities that surround them  Home to an incredible variety of fish and wildlife  supporting our industrial heartland and attracting millions of dollars in recreational tourism  they are an environmental and economic resource to be preserved for generations and they are particularly important to New York  Approximately 80 percent of New York s fresh surface water  over 700 miles of shoreline  and 40 percent of New York s lands in over 25 counties are contained in the drainage basins of Lake Ontario  Lake Erie  and the St  Lawrence River   These waters support populations of trout  salmon and other fish that draw anglers from both inside and outside of New York  The last comprehensive survey was conducted in 1996  and it found that there were 415 000 Great Lakes anglers in New York that year   These fishermen made 5 5 million fishing trips  accounting for 22 percent of all New York sport fishing activity   This means dollars in our economy  a 2001 New York Sea Grant study estimated that expenditures in New York on fresh water fishing are approximately  1 9 billion            It is clearer than ever that the Great Lakes need our help   Pollution  habitat degradation  and aquatic invasive species are taking their toll on the Great Lakes   A 2005 report from a group of prominent Great Lakes scientists concluded that historical threats are combining with new ones  and have brought the Lakes to a tipping point   We need to act now   The good news is that we know what needs to be done  In May of 2004  President Bush created the Great Lakes Task Force  and stated that the  Great Lakes are a national treasure constituting the largest freshwater system in the world    The Federal Government is committed to making progress on the many significant challenges that remain    The Administration then took a step toward meeting that commitment by leading a group of 1 500 people from the region who developed a Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy that identifies key actions that need to be taken in the next five years to restore the Great Lakes  Unfortunately  the President did not take the next step  which is to provide new funding to put the plan into action   The plan calls for a set of actions over five years that will cost approximately  20 billion   But instead of proposing new funding to deal with pollution from sewer systems  the President  s budget cut the Clean Water State Revolving Fund by nearly  200 million dollars            We can  t leave the new Great Lakes plan on the shelf to collect dust   Congress needs to lead where the Administration has been unwilling to do so   I plan to join with Senate colleagues to introduce legislation to fund and implement the recommendations of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy   And I will continue working to enact legislation to combat the introduction and spread of invasive species in the Great Lakes
