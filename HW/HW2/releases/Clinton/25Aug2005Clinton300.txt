

the Defense Department  s recommendations to close the Rome Defense Finance Accounting Service  DFAS  facility               Consolidate the Information Directorate to Rome by moving an information directorate facility  from Wright Patterson to Rome  and              Maintain the Pentagon  s decision to realign the positions at Rome Lab Sensors Directorate             I  m delighted that the BRAC commission accepted the strong arguments that we made and reversed the decision to close Rome  s Defense Finance and Accounting Service facility    Thanks to the hard work of the community  Rome  s DFAS facility will continue to provide its high quality services to our nation  s Department of Defense   Today  s action will preserve the almost 400 jobs that were jeopardized just a few short months ago   Moreover  this decision leaves the door open for further expansion of up to 600 additional jobs at the DFAS facility  a measure that I have long supported and will continue to fight for as a member of the Armed Services Committee            I  m also delighted that the BRAC commission accepted our arguments and has located the Information Directorate facility to the Rome Air Force Research Laboratory   Rome  s role as the headquarters for the Information Directorate makes it the ideal place for this mission  This decision will ensure that the Air Force Research Lab in Rome will continue to be a world class facility supporting our national defense   I was proud to work with the Rome community in making the case to the Commission and I look forward  as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  to continuing to support the Rome Air Force Research Laboratory in the years to come             As New York  s first Senator to sit on the Armed Services Committee  Senator
