   Senator Clinton has been an unwavering champion in the fight to recognize the heroism of those who have received the Purple Heart   Senator Clinton cosponsored legislation  S  Con  Res  56  during the 107th Congress expressing the sense of Congress that a commemorative postage stamp should be issued to honor members of the Armed Forces who have been awarded the Purple Heart  Senator Clinton wrote to the U S  Postmaster General urging support for a commemorative stamp to pay tribute to the Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit  And in May 2003  Senator Clinton attended the ceremony to launch the first issue of the Purple Heart Stamp in Newburgh  NY   The Senate also has approved legislation  sponsored by Senator Clinton and Senator Chuck Hagel  NE   supporting a   National Purple Heart Recognition Day    and honoring all soldiers who were severely injured while serving their country and who were awarded a Purple Heart            The Order of the Purple Heart for Military Merit  commonly known as the Purple Heart  is the oldest military decoration in the world in present use  The Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the President of the United States to members of the Armed Forces who are wounded in conflict with an enemy force  or while held by an enemy force as a prisoner of war  and posthumously to the next of kin of members of the Armed Forces who are killed in conflict with an enemy force  or who die of a wound received in conflict with an enemy force  There are over 1 535 000 recipients of the Purple Heart Medal approximately 550 000 of whom are still living           The Purple Heart was established on August 7  1782 during the Revolutionary War  when General George Washington issued an order establishing the Honorary Badge of Distinction  otherwise known as the Badge of Military Merit  or the Decoration of the Purple Heart           The text of Senator Clinton s petition follows          The Honorable John E  Potter  Postmaster General  United States Postal Service  475 L Enfant Plaza  S W   Room 10022  Washington  D C   20260         Dear Mr  Postmaster General          I write to urge you to ensure that the Purple Heart stamp continues to be issued for years to come   The Military Order of the Purple Heart of the U S A   MOPH  has informed my staff that it understands the stamp will be discontinued in 2006 because of a projected rate rise for stamps   I understand that the National Commander and National Adjutant of the MOPH have contacted you directly to advocate continuing the stamp in a modified format  taking account of any rise in rates   I write in full support of MOPH  s request           While I understand your office receives thousands of requests for stamps each year  I believe that the extraordinary nature of the Purple Heart medal makes an extremely compelling case for continuing to issue the stamp           American troops are bravely serving their nation in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  making sacrifices on our behalf  and following in the long line of courageous service by previous generations of Americans who risked or gave their lives for the freedom we all enjoy today   The Purple Heart stamp is one way in which Americans may honor them and express our gratitude for their service           The history of the Purple Heart Medal gives the stamp special significance   As you know  the Purple Heart Medal dates back to the Revolutionary War and was originally created by General George Washington as the Badge of Military Merit   In February 2002  I wrote to you in strong support of issuance of a commemorative stamp paying tribute to the Purple Heart  our nation  s oldest military decoration  and the hundreds of thousands of American veterans who have earned this honor   I was pleased that the Purple Heart stamp was issued  and I was particularly honored to attend the ceremony to launch the first issue of the Purple Heart Stamp in Newburgh  New York in May 2003           The Purple Heart Stamp honors those service men and women who have made tremendous sacrifices in the defense of our nation   I strongly urge your support and approval for continuing to issue an official Purple Heart stamp for years to come  as tribute to these sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform           Thank you for your consideration of this request   I look forward to your response           Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
