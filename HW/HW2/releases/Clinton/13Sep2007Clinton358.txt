                  Clinton Urges USDA to Shift Focus to Enhancement of Services  Rather Than Pursuing Plans to Consolidate and Reduce Local Field Offices   Legislation Would Block Planned Closure of

            Click here for an audio statement    Washington  DC  Today Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton once again called on the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  to halt their proposal to close local Natural Resources Conservation Services  NRCS   Farm Service Agency  FSA   and Rural Development  RD  field offices in New York State and throughout the country  In a letter to USDA Secretary Michael Johanns  Senator Clinton voiced her strong opposition to the plans  pointing out that the field offices serve as vital resources to New Yorks rural communities  and suggested that the focus of the USDA should be concentrated on improving the quality of the field offices rather than eliminating them    The USDA field offices provide convenient locations where New Yorks farmers have access to a host of outstanding resources that are not only helpful but sometimes vital for their businesses  said Senator Clinton  The benefit to rural Americans is greatly diminished if they are forced to spend valuable time and money traveling greater distances to several different offices to obtain services they used to receive closer to their operations and their communities  This is not a choice that our farmers can live with  and it is not a burden they should have to bear  I strongly urge the USDA to consider the negative impact this will have on farmers in New York and throughout the country  and to withdraw their proposals to consolidate and close the local field offices    In response to feedback following a series of public meetings held by the USDA  Senator Clinton continued to urge the USDA to withdraw their proposal to reduce staff and close or consolidate local field offices  Senator Clinton has argued that a more productive course of action would be to work on addressing staffing shortages by enhancing recruitment and training efforts  and to tackle the difficulties associated with the current computer system so that there could be a more efficient capitalization of the available services  Facilities planned for closure in New York are located in Albany  Broome  Clinton  Fulton  Herkimer  Monroe  Niagara  Onondaga  Oswego  Rensselaer  Steuben  Suffolk  Sullivan  Tompkins  Wayne And Yates Counties     Earlier this summer  Senator Clinton introduced legislation that will act as a companion to legislation introduced in the House by Rep  Stephanie Herseth Sandlin  The bill will prohibit the closure or relocation of any county field office of the USDA until at least one year after the enactment of the coming Farm Bill  to provide for the continuation of agricultural programs for fiscal years after 2007   This language was accepted into the House version of the 2007 Farm Bill and Senator Clinton is pushing for its inclusion in the upcoming Senate version of this reauthorization     A copy of the Senator Clintons letter to Secretary Johanns is attached    September 13  2007   The Honorable Michael Johanns  Secretary  United States Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20250   Dear Mr  Secretary    I am writing in regards to the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  proposals to close Natural Resources Conservation Services  NRCS   Farm Service Agency  FSA  and Rural Development field offices     Recently  the USDA concluded a series of public meetings in New York State on these proposals   Based on the feedback I have received from those meetings  it is clear to me that New York communities and producers strongly oppose the current proposals     New York producers have raised a number of concerns about the proposals   First  many producers are concerned that closures will mean longer travel to field offices  raising transportation costs at a time when farmers are already being squeezed by higher energy costs   Second  many farmers are not convinced that the proposed closings will increase the efficiency of services or benefit farmers  as the USDA has claimed     These field offices serve as a vital resource for New York communities   The offices provide important information and opportunities to farmers  allowing for greater success in our rural communities   Rather than closing the offices  the USDA should address staff shortages by creating programs to sustain and train current and future employees to serve areas where limited staff and recruitment are a problem   I am also aware of difficulties associated with the current computer systems used for USDA services   These problems should be addressed instead of pursuing a plan that will discourage capitalizing of those services    With all of these concerns  I have concluded that the USDA proposals should not go forward   I have introduced S  1821  which would prohibit the closure or relocation of any county  local or field office of the FSA  NRCS or any office related to the rural development mission of the USDA until at least 1 year after the enactment of the 2007 Farm Bill      This legislation has already been embraced by the House of Representatives in their version of this year s reauthorization   However  in the best interest of our farmers  I believe that you should withdraw the closure proposals and work on a plan that improves the quality of USDA field offices    I look forward to working with you  the USDA and my colleagues in the Senate  to ensure the best possible service for our farmers    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton
