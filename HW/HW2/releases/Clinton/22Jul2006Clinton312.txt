July 22  2006 Senator Clinton and Rep  Israel Hold Joint Military Forum                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Clinton  Israel Call for Passage of   Heroes at Home    Initiative for Returning Soldiers Babylon  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  New York  s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee and U S  Rep  Steve Israel  D Huntington  NY   the only New York Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee joined veterans  returning troops and their family members in a forum for military families greatly impacted by the war in Iraq   During the forum  Clinton and Israel called for passage of the   Heroes at Home    initiative which would enhance support services for U S  troops transitioning back home from Iraq and Afghanistan   The forum was hosted by Babylon Town Supervisor Steve Bellone           Hundreds of thousands of troops have rotated through Iraq and Afghanistan  including hundreds of courageous men and women from Long Island  More military service members than ever are surviving these conflicts  but surviving these wars and transitioning home can be an uphill battle     Senator Clinton said    As we heard today  our newest generation of war heroes and their families need our help as they transition home after serving bravely in Iraq and Afghanistan   These heroes deserve our best resources and support to ensure that returning home means returning to life               While our service members have been battling in Iraq and Afghanistan  we  ve had to battle in Congress for adequate equipment in the military theater and adequate services for when they come home     said Rep  Israel     We need to protect our troops while they are in combat  but not lose sight of the challenges facing them upon their return home   This means giving them access to comprehensive health care  financial security and employment and education assistance             The   Heroes at Home    initiative  which Senator Clinton worked to get included in the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Authorization Bill passed by the U S  Senate  must be reconciled with the House Defense Authorization Bill   The initiative would assist military service members of Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  with readjustment to work  posttraumatic stress disorder  PTSD  and other mental health issues and traumatic brain injury  TBI   The measure  which is supported by the National Military Family Association and the Wounded Warrior Project  also provides support to the family members of our returning troops          The Clinton legislation would charge an existing Department of Defense Mental Health Task Force with identifying the mental health problems occurring among National Guard and Reserve members who undergo multiple deployments and making recommendations on ways to improve mental health services for them  The bill would also establish a special working group focused on the transition of National Guard and Reserve members to civilian jobs and designate an office for employers  employment assistance organizations  and associations of employers to provide them with best practices and education for ensuring the success of Guard and Reserve members in resuming civilian work           The legislation also calls for a study on the long term physical and mental health consequences and rehabilitation needs of traumatic brain injured service members  To further assist the mushrooming number of traumatic brain injured service members and their families  this legislation would establish TBI family caregiver training curricula for health professionals at Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs hospitals  who would use the curricula to teach family members important skills for caring for their loved ones suffering from TBI when they go home          According to a March 2006 study  19  of Iraq veterans and 11  of Afghanistan veterans reported mental health problems  Among the OIF and OEF veterans seeking care at VA hospitals  nearly a third have been diagnosed with mental disorders  with over 40  of those PTSD  Another report found that 10  to 30  of National Guard members come home from Iraq searching for work  Others return to civilian jobs dissatisfied with old tasks that pale in comparison to wartime responsibilities  In addition to these challenges  a large number of service members are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan with life threatening brain injuries from roadside blasts that can cause brain damage  It is estimated that TBI affects more than 25  of bomb blast survivors    a percentage thought to be higher than in any other past US conflict  making TBI the   signature    injury of Iraq  The diffuse but debilitating symptoms of TBI can leave service members with cognitive and emotional problems  including the inability to adapt to civilian life  However  TBI frequently goes undiagnosed because returning troops may not realize they suffered a concussion or may not show visible signs of injury  Furthermore  a VA Office of Inspector General report issued this month found that family members of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with TBI need additional resources and support as they care for their loved ones and that case management for these veterans needs to be improved to ensure lifelong coordination of care
