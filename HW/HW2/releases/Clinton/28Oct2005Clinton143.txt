                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Encourages and reminds local communities to submit their comments to the Department of Homeland Security by Monday  October 31  2005                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today submitted her formal comments to the Department of Homeland Security on the proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative   Senator Clinton reiterated her fear that the strict travel restrictions proposed in the Initiative could have far reaching economic implications and widespread social ramifications for both American and Canadian communities along the northern border           Senator Clinton stressed that although national security  particularly security at our borders  must continue to be paramount  it is crucial that any new travel requirements be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism  the regional economy  and the lives of border families          Senator Clinton has expressed her deep reservations about the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative since it was first previewed in April of this year   The Senator has met with community and business leaders from across New York  s Northern Border to discuss this issue and has made her concerns known to both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff   Senator Clinton also sponsored legislation that would have prevented funds from going to the Initiative which was unfortunately eliminated by Republicans in a House Senate Conference          Senator Clinton encourages and reminds local communities to submit their comments to the Department of Homeland Security by Monday  October 31  2005   Interested parties can submit their comments by visiting the following website   http   www

Regulations Branch  1300 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  DC  20229         Re  RIN 1651 AA66  Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Documents Required for Travel within the Western Hemisphere         In response to Federal Register Number 05 17533  I am pleased to provide comments on the Department of Homeland Security  s    DHS     proposed rule regarding documents required for travel within the Western Hemisphere            Section 7209 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  which was signed into law on December 17  2004  requires that the Secretary of DHS  in consultation with the Secretary of the Department of State    State      develop and implement by January 1  2008 a plan to require U S  citizens and non U S  citizens currently exempt from the passport requirement for travel within the Western Hemisphere to present a passport or other authorized documentation that denotes identity and citizenship when entering the United States   In response to this mandate  the DHS  in conjunction with State  undertook the development of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative    WHTI    or   Initiative      which is the subject of this proposed rulemaking            This is a matter of tremendous importance to my constituents and all Americans living along the U S  Canada border   The plan as currently constituted not only has far reaching economic implications but also widespread social ramifications for our communities along the northern border   There is consensus that while national security  and in particular  security at our borders  must continue to be paramount  it is crucial that any new travel requirements be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on tourism and the regional economy   There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers that the Initiative  s identification requirement would not only devastate the tourism and retail industry  but also greatly disrupt life on both sides of the American Canadian border          I have repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the impact of the Initiative since it was first previewed in April 2005   I have written to both Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Rice on this critical matter   While I appreciate why DHS and State support the Initiative  I think its approach tilts the balance too far against having a border that is both safe and convenient to cross for most people   I strongly believe that this is an issue on which we can find a solution that protects our security and at the same time allows for the legal  unencumbered travel across the border that our border communities need to thrive            There is little doubt that the restrictions contemplated by the WHTI would adversely affect the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the American Canadian border   The exchange of goods between the United States and Canada is the largest trading relationship in the world   Thirty nine states sell more of their products to Canada than to any other export market  Canada is the 2nd largest market for the other eleven states   In 2003  Canadians made over 5 7 million visits to New York and Michigan  spending over  550 million   Residents of those two states visited Canada over 16 million times in 2003   These numbers would likely decrease dramatically if a new  potentially onerous form of documentation were required to enter the United States            Such a decrease could be devastating to the national economies of both countries  and most especially  to the economies of border regions like Buffalo Niagara   According to the Buffalo Niagara Partnership  Partnership   which represents nearly 3 000 employer members  requiring a passport for entry into the U S    will devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border      The Partnership notes that   in 2003  there were 3 8 million visits from Canadians to New York State  an increase of 70  over 2002   Those Canadians spent over  392 Million  US  in    New York   Moreover    major tourism developments  such as the over  100 million Bass Pro Project in Buffalo  are being planned based  in part  on the substantial buying power of Canadians in Metro Toronto and Southern Ontario   The Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres are dependent upon ticket sales to fans from Southern Ontario who have the option of watching the games on television rather than in person             The North Country of New York would also feel a profound impact   According to the Plattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce and its thousands of members    to require passports  or NEXUS cards where available  for U S  and Canadian citizens to cross the U S  Canadian border      will substantially discourage cross border travel    and   will depress travel and economic benefit    for both nations            The WHTI requirements could also have a profoundly negative impact on business enterprises like the Rochester Toronto Fast Ferry   The Fast Ferry was launched earlier this year in an attempt to not only ease travel between these two great cities  but also to open up their respective economies to new markets   Ridership on the new ferry has been increasing steadily   Imposing the strict new requirements contemplated by the WHTI would certainly suppress future ridership    particularly the casual day traveler    and could result in the ultimate demise of the Fast Ferry          The requirements of the WHTI would also impose an unfair burden on the people of the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne   The Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne is part of the Greater Mohawk Nation   They presently live on a number of territories stretching along the Ottawa and St  Lawrence Rivers  by Lake Ontario and beyond  all the way to Brantford  Ontario  Canada   The territory called   Akwesasne    straddles the international boundary of Canada and the United States  and the national boundaries of two Canadian Provinces and the New York State Line   Given its unique location  the 7 000 members of this community would be devastated by the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative if implemented in its current form   For example  the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino attracts over 600 000 visitors annually  with approximately 50 percent of their guests hailing from Canada   In addition  a recent informal poll of Mohawk business owners showed that 20 percent of their customers were from the other side of the border            Beyond these economic consequences  the Initiative also poses a threat to the daily lives of the Mohawk community   For example  the Mohawk people often take several trips across the border each day and account for approximately 70 percent of border traffic in the area   Imposing upon them the type of travel restrictions contemplated by the Initiative would have a detrimental effect on many aspects of their daily lives   Perhaps most disturbing  the Initiative could interrupt the cross border travel of 1 300 Mohawk students living on the Canadian side of the border who attend the Salmon River and Massena school districts located on the U S  side            This last example underscores an important point   You should understand that this issue is not solely driven by economics   The people who live in these shared border areas do not regard themselves as Americans or Canadians  but rather as one community of neighbors   American children play sports in Canadian youth leagues   Canadian families visit relatives who live in the U S   Americans and Canadians frequent each others homes and businesses with little regard for the demarcation of the border   Limiting their ability to interact by forcing upon them the restrictions outlined in the Initiative would create a wall splitting one community into two          Lest you think the Initiative poses a unique problem to New York  s border communities  Senator Byron Dorgan  whose home state of North Dakota also shares a substantial U S  Canada border  introduced an amendment during consideration of the FY06 Homeland Security Appropriations bill   His amendment  which was adopted in the Senate by unanimous consent  would have prohibited DHS and State from issuing regulations to limit U S  citizens to a passport as the exclusive document to be presented upon entry into the U S  from Canada by land   Although this provision was ultimately deleted from the conference agreement during reconciliation of the House and Senate bills  it is clearly an issue of tremendous importance to all of my colleagues who likewise represent U S  Canada border communities          While I appreciate the Administration  s apparent amenability to considering alternatives to the passport  I remain concerned that official information about the initiative gives preference to the passport as the ideal form of identification   In its announcement of this comment period  DHS has indicated that other documents issued under various programs designed to speed border crossings will be considered  but goes on to say that   the passport will be the document of choice for travel within the Western Hemisphere or re entry      This stated preference conveys the wrong message if in fact DHS and State are considering alternative forms of identification to allow for expedient and low cost travel across the U S  Canada border          I am also concerned that alternative proposals to the passport do not sufficiently address all of the concerns that make a passport only requirement so burdensome   Any alternative must be sensible  easily obtainable and affordable and must take into consideration the realities of life along the border   It must account for the fact that many travel decisions are made without much forethought   For this reason  the alternative form of identification must be acquirable without significant delay   This alternative form of identification must also be affordable   Imposing a significant charge per identification on families    particularly those with minor children and infants    is not only impractical  but it does not address the affordability concerns posed by a passport only requirement           I appreciate the opportunity to provide comment on the proposed WHTI   I look forward to examining closely the alternatives proposed by the Administration and am hopeful that we can find a solution that properly balances our mutual interest in a secure northern border with our desire to maintain communities that are both economically and socially vibrant          Sincerely            Hillary Rodham Clinton
