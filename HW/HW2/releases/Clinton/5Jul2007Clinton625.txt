July 5  2007 Clinton  Schumer Welcome FAA Participation in Televised Meeting in Ramapo on Airspace Redesign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senators Welcome Televised Meeting as a Good First Step but Continue their Call on FAA Administrator to Hold Additional Meetings to Take the Concerns of Residents into Consideration                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer today welcomed an announcement by the Ramapo Town Supervisor Christopher P  St Lawrence that the Federal Aviation Authority  FAA  will be participating in a televised meeting on the proposed New York New Jersey Philadelphia Airspace Redesign Project  According to the FAA  Steve Kelley  Manager of the Airspace Redesign project for the FAA will be participating in a live telecast on July 12th to talk about what impact the plan will have on Rockland County      Responding to concerns expressed by Rockland County residents  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer this week urged the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  to hold additional meetings on the airspace proposal  arguing that the concerns of Rockland County residents had not been taken into account  Today  the Senators continued their call on the FAA to hold in person meetings in Rockland to hear the concerns of local residents    I think it is only fair to have an honest dialogue between Rockland County residents and the FAA before moving forward with a plan that could dramatically change the community  Senator Clinton said today   The residents of this densely populated area who are being asked to endure increased noise and air pollution deserve to have their concerns addressed   The current form of the plan  which could bring 200 additional flights over Rockland alone  is not only a quality of life issue but it raises significant health concerns that must be taken into consideration    This is terrific news for Rockland residents and guarantees them a seat at the table when it comes evaluating the details of the redesign and how it will affect their own community  said Senator Schumer  While I m thrilled the FAA recognized the need to give affected communities a greater role in this process  I will continue to fight for additional meetings to bring about more opportunities for residents to voice their thoughts and concerns about the proposal    According to the FAA  their proposal to redesign the flight path surrounding Newark Liberty International Airport is an attempt to reduce delays into major airports around New York  New Jersey and Philadelphia   The FAA has attended meetings in neighboring communities to hear concerns but have not engaged Rockland residents in the process   With decibel levels expected to rise  there has been outrage from residents and local officials      A copy of the Senators letter from earlier this week follows    July 3  2007   The Honorable Marion Blakey  Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20591   Dear Administrator Blakey    We are writing to express our concern over the preferred alternative that the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  has chosen for the New York New Jersey Philadelphia Airspace Redesign Project   The plan put forward by the FAA is still being explored by many of our constituents and these residents have not adequately been able to express their concerns to the FAA   Therefore  we urge the FAA to schedule additional meetings in the New York metropolitan area as soon as possible   The plan  as currently proposed  fails to address the noise and environmental concerns of many of our constituents  especially in Rockland County    Given the scope of the project being undertaken  the first major overhaul of airspace in almost 50 years  we would have hoped that this type of comprehensive review would also have placed as a priority the noise concerns of our constituents who have been burdened by increasing air traffic noise for many years   We are particularly concerned about the flights to Newark International Airport over Rockland County starting in 2011   Any plan put forward must address noise mitigation measures proposed for the communities impacted by air traffic to and from Newark International Airport      We understand the priority of the Airspace Redesign Project to be efficiency   However  we cannot overlook the fact that increased efficiency and increased traffic mean an increase in air traffic noise and pollution for many communities in Rockland County   Many communities are still learning just how this plan will affect their community   We urge you to schedule public meetings in the Rockland County area as soon as possible to give residents an opportunity to voice their concerns about noise and pollution levels resulting from air traffic outlines in the Redesign plan    Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to working together to find an alternative that addresses the noise concerns of our constituents   Sincerely    Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer
