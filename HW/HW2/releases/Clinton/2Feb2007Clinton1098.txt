February 2  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on United Nations Report on Climate Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC      The scientific consensus is clear and overwhelming  we are causing the planet to warm  with potentially devastating consequences  We need to take immediate steps to address this problem          Critics contend that action will be too costly  but I believe that action is both an environmental necessity and an economic opportunity  By putting the right incentives in place  we will drive American businesses to innovate  creating new products and new jobs  Failing to act is the riskier course to both our environment and our economy  That is why I have cosponsored legislation with Senators Lieberman and McCain to require significant reductions in the pollution that is causing global warming           I am increasingly optimistic that this Congress will face this problem  because the vast majority of Americans now understand the risks that we face  For that we owe a debt of gratitude to Vice President Gore for his tireless and creative advocacy  But there is one American who has not yet faced up to the issue  President Bush  Last week  the President mentioned global warming in the State of the Union  now it s time for him to embrace a solution           This report presents us with a clear choice   Do we face our responsibility to act or do we continue to look the other way  Do we act or do we accept the risk of handing a degraded planet to our children  our grandchildren  and their grandchildren   I think the answer is clear   It is time for us to act   I will be pressing for action in the Senate this year
