emerging companies with high growth potential to network with investors  research institutions  and government officials  for established companies to discover partnership opportunities with start up businesses that are commercializing cutting edge research  and for investors to explore new technologies and new companies          Over the next decade  the development of breakthrough technologies in three critical areas    wireless technology  nanotechnology and biological sciences will have a significant impact on the companies  entrepreneurs and academic researchers who are defining next generation products and services for their customers  Individually  these technologies have been driving innovation over the last ten years  but it is their overlap and the synergies between them that will define the next phase of scientific discovery            There is tremendous economic growth potential in the convergence of these technologies     said Roger C  Altman  Chairman of the Board of Directors     In order to harness this potential  we need to strengthen intra state partnerships between private industry and academic institutions and between Downstate and Upstate companies and universities             The conference featured a keynote address by Senator Clinton and included a trade show highlighting twenty eight exhibits of New York State  s leading nanotechnology  wireless

this Expo  the Defense and Aerospace Suppliers Conference and the Pfizer biotechnology event will enable our State  s largest companies  many of which are leaders in the defense  aerospace  and biotechnology industries  to strengthen their existing partnerships  or create new ones  with the world class emerging companies across New York State             The first panel    Trends and
