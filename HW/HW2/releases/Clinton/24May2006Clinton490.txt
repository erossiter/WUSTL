May 24  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Stem Cell Research Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC     Today marks the one year anniversary of the passage of H R  810  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  by the House of Representatives  Despite significant bipartisan support for this legislation  Senator Frist and the Republican leadership have refused to allow this bill to come to a vote on the Senate floor  On today  s anniversary  I urge Senator Frist to bring H R  810 for a vote on the Senate floor without any additional delay          I am a cosponsor of S  471  the Senate version of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  Both of these bills would remove restrictions on federally funded stem cell research by allowing couples to voluntarily donate embryos created for the purpose of fertility treatment to researchers  If these embryos were not donated for research  they would otherwise be discarded  but this legislation would allow them to be used to engage in critically important medical research          Stem cell research holds promise for millions of Americans with diabetes  Parkinson  s  Alzheimer  s  spinal cord injuries  and other conditions  Many New Yorkers affected by these disorders have shared with me the hope that stem cell research brings to them  their families  and their friends  By restricting federal funding for this type of research  we are limiting the ability of our scientists to aggressively pursue avenues that could lead to cures for many chronic  debilitating  and ultimately fatal diseases  We cannot afford any additional delay in carrying out research that has the potential to save millions of lives          Our country is the world  s leader in medical research  It is critical that we increase federal support for stem cell research in order to maintain the ability of our nation  s scientists to remain at the forefront of biomedical discoveries  and attract and retain top notch scientific talent to its laboratories          I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that H R  810 receives full consideration by the Senate  and that the promise of embryonic stem cell research can be fully realized
