April 23  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the NRC s Proposed  130 000 Fine to Entergy for Missing Siren Deadline                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As I have said  it is completely unacceptable that Entergy did not have the new siren system in place by the prescribed deadline  I hope that this action gets Entergy s attention and forces them to act on the litany of problems they are facing  I also hope this signals a new willingness by the NRC to undertake tougher oversight at Indian Point                Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Indian Point
