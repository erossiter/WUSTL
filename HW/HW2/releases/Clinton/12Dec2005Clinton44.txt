December 12  2005 Senator Clinton Welcomes Secretary Leavitt  s Decision to Compensate Former Linde Ceramics Nuclear Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed Secretary Leavitt  s approval to compensate   Special Exposure Cohort    workers at the Linde Ceramics Plant who worked there between October 1942 and October 1947 as recommended by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  s  NIOSH     Eligible workers who were employed at least 250 days during this time period will be compensated through the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  EEOICP              I am pleased that Secretary Leavitt approved NIOSH Advisory Board  s recommendation and that former Linde Ceramics nuclear workers will finally receive the compensation they deserve     said Senator Clinton     This compensation is long overdue and I will continue to fight to ensure Bethlehem Steel nuclear workers receive the same compensation              Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 to compensate workers who contracted radioactive cancer  beryllium disease or chronic silicosis after working at sites that performed nuclear weapons work during World War II and the Cold War   Under EEOICPA  former nuclear workers or their survivors were eligible to file claims with the US Department of Labor  DOL  for individual payments of  150 000  as well as medical benefits   To file a claim  patients or their surviving families needed to provide proper documentation of their illness and employment history             Claims are decided by the DOL and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  by using available records about work conditions and employment history   Using these records  NIOSH estimates the radiation doses received by each worker and then determines whether that radiation exposure was likely to have caused the worker  s illness   Alternatively  workers may submit a   special cohort    petition for a class of workers if they believe that the available information does not allow dose reconstruction work to be done accurately   The special cohort process was initiated in this case  after NIOSH determined that it was unable to do dose reconstruction for a former Linde employee who had applied for compensation
