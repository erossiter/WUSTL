                                                                                                                                                                                                                     State Ban on Direct Shipment of Wine Hurts   New York s Economy  Winegrowers   Consumers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Aquebogue  NY    At a press conference today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was joined by Long Island wine producers in urging the New York State legislature to pass legislation allowing New York State wine producers to ship their products directly to consumers in other states         New York State is the third largest wine producing state in the U S   and the largest wine producing state that does not allow direct shipment  Currently  state law prohibits wine producers from shipping wine directly to consumers in other states  greatly impeding New York s fastest growing agricultural industry  However  the Supreme Court ruled earlier this week that state laws banning or restricting interstate wine shipments are discriminatory and  therefore  unconstitutional         This week s Supreme Court decision is monumental and gives our world class wine industry the opportunity for growth that it so richly deserves  Wine growers  consumers and New York  s economy will all benefit from lifting the ban on wine shipments across state lines   Senator Clinton said   I call on the New York State Assembly and Senate to support our wine industry and once and for all change these outdated and unfair laws         At the press conference  which was held at Paumanok Vineyard  the Senator released a letter that she sent on Friday to New York Senate Majority Leader Joseph L  Bruno and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver calling on the two leaders to work with their colleagues to pass legislation lifting the ban         The Senator wrote   I urge you to join with me in supporting our state s outstanding vineyards by working with your counterparts in the State Legislature to insure that our New York wine industry flourishes  As New Yorkers  we can be proud of the reputation of our wines  the beauty of our grape growing regions  and the accomplishments of our world class research institutions  You and your colleagues in the New York State Assembly  Senate  now have the opportunity to share our achievements with the rest of the country          A long time advocate of New York s wine and grape industry  Senator Clinton has repeatedly called on Governor Pataki and members of the New York State legislature to change New York State law to allow New York wine producers to ship wine to other states  The New York State Legislature passed a bill nine years ago to allow direct shipment  but Governor Pataki vetoed it        Thirteen states already have reciprocal wine shipment laws and eight have laws that allow direct shipment of wine  In addition  Federal Trade Commission reports have shown that the direct shipment of wine will lower prices  increase consumer choice and not lead to tax evasion or the sale of alcohol to minors  as some opponents argue        New York State ranks third nationally in wine production  According to the New York Farm Bureau  the state has almost one thousand family owned vineyards that produce 175 000 tons of grapes annually    a  40 million industry  There are 170 wineries in the four main wine producing regions of the state  the Finger Lakes  Long Island  the Hudson River Valley and the Lake Erie region  These wineries produce over 100 million bottles of wine every year and attract approximately one million tourists  Below is the text from the Senator s letters to Senate Majority Leader Joseph L  Bruno   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver        May 20  2005       Dear Senate Majority Leader Joseph L  Bruno   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver        As I am certain you are aware  the recent decision of the United States Supreme Court  Granholm v  Heald  2005 WL 1130571  U S    May 16  2005   states unequivocally that state laws banning or restricting interstate wine shipments are discriminatory and  therefore  unconstitutional         While the matter has been remanded to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals  the practical effect of this decision is to assign New York s state legislature with the task of amending the restrictive laws that hamper the ability of our state s fine wineries from competing in an open and fair national market        The Supreme Court s decision affords a unique opportunity to nurture the growth of the New York State grape and wine industry  Not only is it the fastest growing industry in agriculture and tourism in New York  it possibly represents the largest growing sector of our State s economy  There are over 170 wineries across New York  the vast majority of which are small businesses    in the Finger Lakes region alone  there are 92 wineries  The Supreme Court s decision opens the door to an entirely new stream of business for these small enterprises and creates an exciting opportunity for financial growth for our economy         I have long been an advocate for New York s wine and grape industry and I urge you to join with me in supporting our state s outstanding vineyards by working with your counterparts in the State Legislature to insure that our New York wine industry flourishes  As New Yorkers  we can be proud of the reputation of our wines  the beauty of our grape growing regions  and the accomplishments of our world class research institutions  You and your colleagues in the New York State Assembly  Senate  now have the opportunity to share our achievements with the rest of the country         New York wine is being denied to consumers throughout the country who recognize its outstanding qualities  You can help them and New York State s economy at the same time by giving our homegrown wine industry the opportunity for the growth that it so richly deserves         Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton
