                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senator Clinton  Reps  Maloney  King and McHugh applaud provision included in final Defense Authorization bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC   More than four years after 9 11  hundreds of members of the National Guard who served at Ground Zero after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center will finally receive full federal retirement credit for their service  The final version of the FY06 Defense Authorization bill  H R  1815   which successfully passed the House of Representatives this week  includes a provision to provide the retirement credit        Senator Hillary Clinton  NY  and Reps  Carolyn Maloney  NY  and Peter King  NY   who have helped lead the effort to secure the retirement credit  today praised the Congressional action to correct this problem  Senator Clinton and Reps  Maloney and King  NY   with other members of the New York delegation  had introduced legislation in the Senate and House award retirement credits for National Guard service in response to 9 11                                 I m delighted that Congress accepted our arguments for those brave men and women of the National Guard who gave their all after the September 11th attacks   said Senator Clinton  who as a DoD Authorization conferee lobbied the joint Senate House conference to have the legislation included in the final version of the FY 2006 Department of Defense Authorization Bill   In the aftermath of 9 11  we relied on the members of the New York National Guard to help protect sensitive sites throughout the State  and they continue to play a crucial role in our homeland security  With this legislation  we are insuring that Guard members who served at Ground Zero  often for extended periods  will be awarded federal retirement credits          With this action  we have righted one of the obvious remaining wrongs left over from 9 11   said Maloney   The National Guard was integral to the security and rescue effort in lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks  and they deserve full retirement credit for their heroic work  I am very appreciative of my colleague from New York  Congressman McHugh  for his hard work on this in the Armed Services Committee  and I also thank Congressmen Hunter  Skelton and Snyder from the committee for their understanding and action on this issue  I am proud to have worked closely with my friend Peter King to achieve this victory          It is fundamentally unfair that soldiers from the same Battalion are being compensated differently for their September 11th related service   said King   Providing federal retirement credits to all members of the National Guard who served in disaster area after September 11th is simply the right thing for Congress to do         Background        Several hundred soldiers from the National Guard who responded to the World Trade Center site after the September 11th terrorist attacks have not received the military retirement benefits they deserve  Many of the soldiers who guarded Ground Zero after the attacks were not officially put on federal active duty  As a result  they did not receive federal military retirement credit for their more than 300 days of service  Other soldiers from the same unit were activated under federal duty to help secure the U S  Military Academy  and have received the appropriate retirement credit  Clearly  all National Guard troops who served during this unprecedented national emergency deserve equal status        Many of the same soldiers who protected New York after 9 11 are now serving courageously in Iraq  Sixteen members of the Manhattan based 69th National Guard Regiment have died in the Iraq war   eight in the past year alone  In April  six members of the 69th Regiment were awarded Purple Hearts after being wounded in Iraq by roadside bombs         The legislation that passed today provides all National Guard soldiers who performed full time State active duty service on or after September 11  2001 and before October 1  2002  in support of a Federal declaration of emergency following the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11  2001  with federal military retirement credit for that time served in the following covered disaster counties   1  In the State of New York  Bronx  Kings  New York  boroughs of Brooklyn and Manhattan   Queens  Richmond  Delaware  Dutchess  Nassau  Orange  Putnam  Rockland  Suffolk  Sullivan  Ulster  and Westchester   2  In the State of Virginia  Arlington        Joining Representatives Maloney and King on the original House legislation to provide the National Guard with federal retirement credit for 9 11 service  H R  2499  were New York Members of Congress Gary Ackerman  D   Vito Fossella  R   Maurice Hinchey  D   Steve Israel  D   Nita Lowey  D   Carolyn McCarthy  D   Major Owens  D   Jos     Serrano  D   and Edolphus Towns  D
