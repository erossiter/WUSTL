                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Clinton Legislation Will Aid Growing Number of Grandparents and Other Relatives Raising Children Bronx  NY   In a visit today to the GrandParent Family Apartments  the first apartments in the nation built from the ground up for grandparents raising grandchildren  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with families and advocates to underscore the urgent need to support the growing numbers of grandparents and other relative caregivers raising children   Emphasizing the need to remove barriers that too often confront kinship caregivers  Senator Clinton announced that she has re introduced legislation in the Senate to provide needed assistance to kinship caregivers and enable kinship care for more children who otherwise would be in foster care           So many grandparents and other relatives are making great personal sacrifices to provide safe and loving homes for the children in their care  These guardians often take on this responsibility unexpectedly  facing physical  emotional  and financial challenges   said Senator Clinton    Too often  the deck is stacked against these caring relatives  difficulties gaining formal custody of the children in their care  enrolling children in school  authorizing medical treatment  retaining public housing  getting affordable legal services  and  accessing benefits that could help them provide care   By taking common sense steps  we can remove these unnecessary barriers and address the unique challenges facing kinship caregivers struggling to do the right thing for our children   said Senator Clinton          At the press conference  Senator Clinton was joined by Congressman Jose Serrano  Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion  David Taylor  Executive Director of Presbyterian Senior Services  Laura Jervis  Executive Director of the West Side Federation for Senior and Supportive Housing Inc  and Donna Butts  Executive Director of Generations United  along with grandparents  kinship caregivers  and other advocates including the Children s Defense Fund of New York  the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies  and the Child Welfare League of America          More than six million children   1 in 12   are living in households headed by grandparents or other relatives   In New York City alone  there are over 245 000 adolescents living in grandparent headed households   Across New York  more than 400 000 children   more than nine percent of the children in the state   live in households headed by a grandparent or other relative according to the most recent data available from the U S  Census Bureau   An estimated 20 000 children living in foster care across the country could leave the system if Congress made subsidized guardianship available to their families           Senator Clinton s legislation  the Kinship Caregiver Support Act  will establish a Kinship Navigator Program in states  large metropolitan areas and Indian tribal organizations to assist kinship caregivers in navigating needed programs and services   The program will provide families with the guidance they need to obtain health care coverage for the children in their care  apply for housing assistance  locate childcare  enroll children in school  and gain access to other services           The bill also will establish a Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program to provide federal assistance to states for subsidized guardianship programs to better serve the needs of kinship care families and make it possible for grandparents and other relatives who become kinship caregivers to receive the same subsidy a foster family would receive   Currently  kinship caregivers are not eligible to receive such a subsidy to help provide for a child who would otherwise be in foster care          In addition  Senator Clinton s legislation will ensure notice is given to relatives when children enter foster care   Unfortunately  grandparents and other relatives often do not know when their grandchildren or nieces and nephews come under the care of the State  Notifying grandparents and other relatives when children enter the foster care system will make it easier for families to stay together          Senator Clinton introduced the bipartisan Kinship Caregiver Support Act along with Senator Olympia Snowe  R ME  in the 108th and 109th Congresses and will continue to press for passage of the legislation  Supporters of the legislation include  Generations United  the Children s Defense Fund  the Child Welfare League of America  the AARP  the National Black Caucus of State Legislators  the Center for Law and Social Policy  CLASP   Grandparents for Children s Rights  the Kids are Waiting Campaign and the Evan P  Donaldson Adoption Institute      The Kinship Caregiver Support Act  Fact Sheet   The Rise of Kinship Caregiver Families      Nationwide  more than 6 million children  that is  1 in 12 children  are living in households headed by grandparents or other relatives  i e    kinship caregivers             The 2005 U S  Census Bureau American Community Survey shows 279 899 children in grandparent headed homes in New York and another 138 750 children living in other relative headed homes  That makes a total of 418  649   more than 9 percent of children in the state          Kinship caregivers  who often become parents unexpectedly  face unique challenges to successfully raising children  including difficulties enrolling children in school  authorizing medical treatment  maintaining their public housing leases  obtaining affordable legal services  and accessing a variety of federal benefits and services   Almost one fifth of grandparents responsible for their grandchildren live in poverty       The Bill      The Kinship Caregiver Support Act attempts to address the full range of emotional  physical and financial difficulties facing children and kinship caregivers so that relatives may become formal guardians and at the same time receive some financial assistance  It takes three important steps to assist children being raised and cared for by kinship caregivers  Specifically  the bill               Establishes a Kinship Navigator Program in states  large metropolitan areas  and Indian tribal organizations to assist kinship caregivers to navigate their way through existing programs and services  This program will provide families with the guidance they need to learn how to obtain health care coverage for them  apply for housing assistance  locate childcare  enroll them in school  and gain access to other services               Establishes a Kinship Guardianship Assistance Program to provide federal assistance to states for subsidized guardianship programs to better serve the needs of kinship care families  This provision gives states the option to use their Title IV E funds to provide payments to grandparents and other relatives who have assumed legal guardianship of children they ve cared for as foster parents               Ensures notice to relatives when children enter foster care to make it easier for families to stay together          The new version of this bill strengthens systems already in place to support these families by               Expanding eligibility for the Foster Care Independence Program so Education and Training Vouchers  ETV  are available to young people who exit foster care after age 16 to guardianship just as young people exiting adoption can receive these vouchers               Strengthening requirements for collaboration in Navigator grants to address the link between incarcerated parents and kinship caregivers       Support      Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Olympia Snowe  R ME  have introduced this legislation in the last two Congresses  Senator Thad Cochran  R MS  was also an original co sponsor  In the 109th Congress  the following Members were also co sponsors  Senators Coleman  Jeffords  Johnson  Kerry  Landrieu  Lautenberg  Obama and Schumer          Groups supporting the bill include  Generations United  the Children s Defense Fund  the Child Welfare League of America  the AARP  the National Black Caucus of State Legislators
