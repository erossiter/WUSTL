November 2  2005 Clinton Applauds Commerce Committee Passage of E 911 Bill for Broadband Phones                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Clinton applauded the Commerce Committee  s passage of the IP Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act of 2005 she cosponsored with Senators Bill Nelson  FL  and Conrad Burns  MT   This legislation codifies and expands the Federal Communications Commission  s  FCC  recent order requiring providers of Voice Over Internet Protocol  VoIP  telephone service to provide enhanced 911  E 911  service for all of their customers           Effective E 911 capabilities can literally mean the difference between life and death   We need to ensure that any emergency 911 call whether it  s made on a landline  cell phone or broadband VoIP phone  is answered    It  s clear that as more and more consumers choose VoIP service  the regulations and laws that are in place to protect consumers must be updated as well     Senator Clinton said        E 911 is the capability of transmitting a callback number and location information to an emergency call center  Given that VoIP service is routed over a computer  s broadband lines instead of a traditional telephone line  there have been particular challenges to providing E 911 service        The Nelson  Clinton  Burns bill requires that the FCC review its recent rules and  if necessary  set new rules requiring IP enabled voice service providers to ensure that 911 and E911 services are available to all VOIP subscribers   In instances where that 911 service is not feasible  the VoIP provider would have to take steps to ensure that the consumer is fully aware that they don  t have E 911 service      Moreover  telephone companies that own the necessary emergency service infrastructure must provide VoIP service providers with access to their networks for the provision of all 911 and E 911 services      The bill would also require VoIP providers to work in coordination with the National 911 Implementation and Coordination Office  which was created under the Clinton Burns ENHANCE 911 Act signed into law last year  to work with the VoIP industry to develop a plan for creating a national Internet based emergency network            This legislation will go a long way towards ensuring that all VoIP customers can be confident that their emergency calls will be received and answered   As this act continues to make its way through Congress  I will continue to work with my colleagues  the public safety community  and the towns and cities that oversee 911 call centers to ensure that this bill reflects the priorities and needs of consumers and the men and women in the emergency response community     Senator Clinton added
