                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Clinton Reiterates Imperative for Pentagon Planning for the Redeployment of U S Troops from Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC  In response to questioning from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  at todays Senate Armed Services Committee hearing  Admiral Michael Mullen  nominated by President Bush to succeed General Peter Pace as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  committed to keeping the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Congress informed  in classified sessions if necessary  about the process of contingency planning for any future redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq    Below is the transcript of Senator Clintons exchange with Admiral Michael Mullen  nominated to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and General James Cartwright  nominated to be Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff      SENATOR CLINTON   Thank you very much  Admiral Mullen and General Cartwright   I appreciate greatly your committed service to our nation  And I also want to thank your families because I know they ve served as well   Both of you have long and distinguished careers that have taken you around the world   And your families have been there with you and supporting you and supporting our country   So I appreciate that   As both of you are  I m sure  aware  I have recently corresponded with Secretary Gates  requesting briefings for the appropriate oversight committees  including this one  on what the current contingency plans are for any future withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq   In my exchanges with Secretary Gates  I pointed out that the seeds of many of the problems that continue to plague us in Iraq  both in terms of troops and mission  were planted in the failure to adequately plan for the conflict and then properly equip our men and women in uniform   After an exchange of letters with Secretary Gates and Under Secretary of Defense Eric Edelman  this Thursday  the Department of Defense will brief this committee  in a closed session  on the status of planning for the redeployment of U S  forces   In his letter  last week  to me  Secretary Gates stated  and I quote  You may rest assured that such planning is indeed taking place with my active involvement  as well as that of senior military and civilian officials and our commanders in the field   I consider this contingency planning to be a priority for this department  end quote    Let me ask you both   Are you aware of the contingency planning that Secretary Gates referred to in his letter  Admiral Mullen    ADMIRAL MULLEN   Yes  ma am  I am    CLINTON   And you also  General Cartwright   GENERAL CARTWRIGHT   I m aware   In my current job  I don t participate in it right now    CLINTON   If confirmed  will each of you be involved  insofar as you know  in this contingency planning  Admiral Mullen   MULLEN   Senator Clinton  in part of my Advanced Policy Questions  I was asked where I think we made mistakes   One of the things is that I    one of the issues is I didn t think we planned it  We didn t have the planning that we should have had in place   If confirmed  I m very committed to properly planning  to the best of my ability  every possible operation that we might be involved in   And that certainly includes the kind of contingency planning that you ve asked about in your letters and to which the secretary has responded and of which I am aware and  to a certain degree thus far  have participated    CLINTON   Thank you   General Cartwright   CARTWRIGHT   I concur    CLINTON   And I would ask each of you if you will commit to keeping this committee and the Congress informed  in classified sessions if necessary  about the process of contingency planning for any future redeployment    Admiral   MULLEN   Yes  ma am   CLINTON   General    CARTWRIGHT   Yes  ma am    CLINTON   And it is clear that    as you pointed out in your advance questions provided to this committee    that many of us have serious concerns about the quality of planning  the interaction between the military and civilian leadership with respect to planning  the decision making process  certainly leading up to the invasion and then continuing in the years since  And I think that many of us will be looking to you as our chief military officers for our country to really focus in on this planning issue   I ve been impressed with Secretary Gates  openness and willingness to interact with the Congress  to listen to the professional military leadership around him  but I m looking for ideas about how to institutionalize that   I think that the lessons learned from the last years may be very difficult ones for any of us to learn and apply  but we have to be committed to doing so   And it does seem that the Congress is moving toward an effort to put down conditions for a phased redeployment   And obviously  whether that happens this year or next year  it s going to happen at some point   And none of us want to see the consequences of poor planning   The other issue here that is not  perhaps  strictly within the military s purview is the question of the thousands of Iraqi civilians who have been assisting us over the last years   the translators and interpreters  the cooks  the embassy employees   And recently Ambassador Crocker has raised very serious questions about what exactly our planning is for them   So I would suggest that perhaps that at least be considered in the contingency planning  because I think that is a continuing responsibility that we bear   And I would appreciate each of you taking that and moving forward    And I think that in your answers  Admiral Mullen  in the Advance Policy Questions  you say something that I think all of us agree with and that is  there is no purely military solution in Iraq    Does that lead you to the conclusion that even if our troops were to have tactical successes in parts of Iraq  as now is being reported in Al Anbar province  that we cannot consider our mission successful without political action and even  you know  some resolution of the differences among the various factions within Iraq   MULLEN   Yes  ma am   I think the lead issue is political reconciliation for that government and progress on the political leg of the security  economic and political three legged stool that we ve talked about   Absolutely has to happen   CLINTON   It appears that the political progress is not occurring   And this is something that our chairman has been particularly focused on  really from before the invasion and certainly consistently since   the failure to establish and then to achieve benchmarks when we had the occupying authority and in the years since we have seen an Iraqi government established   And  well  I have to ask  you know  in your Advance Policy Question responses  in what you have talked about today  given the lack of political progress since the escalation began    despite what may be admittedly short term advances with the surge strategy  how do we expect to obtain any evidence of political movement in the absence of a very different attitude and capacity of the Iraqi government  that were we to be there  as you suggested  for years instead of months  do you have any suggestions as to what more could be done to force or require the political resolution that is so necessary   MULLEN   I think it s been clearly stated within the last year that they need to make progress in terms of amnesty  de Baathification  an oil    a revenue sharing law  constitutional reform  relationships with the provinces and that progress there has not been good   At least that s the current assessment   I  at this point  would    what I was asked to do was really wait until Ambassador Crocker  who has the lead on this aspect of it  comes back with General Petraeus and reports in September   I still maintain that if we aren t making progress in that realm  the prospects for movement in a positive direction are not very good    But waiting until then I think is important   CLINTON   Well  I agree with your assessment   I obviously reached that conclusion some time ago in terms of the assessment as to what the Iraqis themselves are actually willing to do   I think you could make a very strong case that the Iraqis are not ready to put violence aside as a tool for the various agendas they re pursuing   sectarian  political  personal  commercial   There s a lot of activity going on here   And it does seem to me that either sooner  in my view  which is the appropriate outcome  you both most likely will be confirmed  which I think is a great tribute to you both for your service to this country    will be faced with implementing a new approach  a sort of post surge approach   And I think that the political problems that the Iraqis are failing to address will  unfortunately  require that we take a different strategic attitude toward Iraq  and that the results will have to be carefully monitored because  obviously  there are consequences no matter what we do    I guess the final thing that I would    two final points  if I could  Mr  Chairman   The concerns that many have    and regardless of where one stands on how much time we should provide or not    the concerns that we all share are the consequences for our troops and for the Iraqi people that will flow from a decision to redeploy   if we redeploy out of Baghdad and concentrate on Al Anbar  if we redeploy into the north and concentrate on shoring up the Kurds  that they re not subjected to most likely Sunni and external problems     You know  whatever the combination of actions might be  it will be incredibly important that it be managed and implemented as carefully as possible because of the difficulty of withdrawing troops and equipment   And everybody who has briefed me on this basically comes to the same conclusion   that this is as dangerous as going in   And we know that if our only way out is through the south into Kuwait  it is especially dangerous because the increasing chaotic situation in the south  with various Shiite factions vying for control  will make us  unfortunately  have to navigate an even more dangerous exit   So I guess I would just underscore this    that this has to continue and has to be focused   And  finally  I think that the work that you will have to supervise not only is operational  of course  but may very well be doctrinal    I mean  it took quite some time to rewrite and revise and update the counterinsurgency manual   The doctrines that the former Secretary of Defense would quite often  sort of  refer to or throw out seemed not to be based on very much work or  frankly  institutional support and infrastructure   And so I think that there is not only a very difficult strategic and operational side of this  but also a doctrinal side    And I would strongly recommend that when you assume your new positions    since you ll be consumed by the day to day operations  because no matter what happens it s going to be incredibly intense  I would predict  both politically here in Washington  but on the ground and militarily and politically in Iraq    that you think about  and perhaps in conjunction with this committee and others  coming up with some process to look at a lot of these doctrines and assumptions that  I think  clouded judgment and undermined the careful thought that should go into any difficult and dangerous set of decisions   such as we were making as a country    So I don t think it s something that either of you will have the time to focus on  but under your supervision and monitoring  I think it is extremely important that we really understand where we re headed with a new kind of enemy  with a different kind of warfare  with a global threat   Because we will withdraw from Iraq   We will certainly do it  I believe  almost regardless of what happens in the next year with this president  as soon as we change presidents   And how we do it  how we re prepared for it   But then we re going to have a lot of other problems that we face globally that we ll need some clear thinking on  So I wish you both well  and I thank you for your service    SENATOR CARL LEVIN  CHAIRMAN  SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE   Thank you  Senator Clinton   And thank you  also  for your initiative  which is one many of you ve taken    just the latest to urge this committee to get that briefing that you referred to on preparations and planning for a phased reduction and redeployment of our forces   It will take place at some point  in the view of many of us  sooner rather than later   But in any event  it will take place   And we very much appreciate your suggestion that there be a briefing   And it will take place  as you indicated  this week      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
