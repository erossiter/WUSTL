August 1  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Recess Appointment of John Bolton                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I am deeply disappointed by the President  s decision  particularly in light of last week  s admission by Mr  Bolton that he was not entirely truthful on a questionnaire submitted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee   Even more disturbing is that this announcement comes on the heels of the Administration  s refusal to turn over documents requested by the Senate during the confirmation process   As we work to build relationships across the globe and reform and strengthen the UN  the UN Ambassador is an important position which deserves Senate confirmation   It is troubling that the President has circumvented the process on a position so critical to our national security and international reputation
