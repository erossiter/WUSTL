April 19  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Final Status Talks on Kosovo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       As the Final Status Talks on Kosovo head into their decisive phase  I wish to express my support for the plan put forth by the U N  Special Envoy  Martti Atisaari  in the strongest possible terms   Independence for  the Kosovar Albanians is long overdue  and the Atisaari Plan will complete the process begun with the successful U S  led NATO intervention of 1999   an event that I observed at very close hand            In supporting the independence of Kosovo  it is critically important that the rights of all minorities in Kosovo are protected  especially the Serbs   Past injustices do not justify revenge   Those Serbs who wish to remain in Kosovo must be allowed to do so without fear or intimidation   Serb cultural and religious monuments must not be vandalized again  as has happened in the past           I urge all members of the U N  Security Council to support the Atisarri plan and avoid efforts to veto  dilute or delay its implementation   Such efforts can only strengthen hard liners in both Serbia and Kosovo  By supporting the Atisarri plan  the U N  Security Council can ensure that the Albanian majority will be able to take its rightful place among the independent nations of the world
