                                                                                                                                                                                                                     New Statistics Show Nearly 300 000 New Yorkers Eligible for Medicare Still Have No Prescription Drug Coverage      Senator Clinton Calls for   Report Card    on Performance of Participating Plans                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Secretary of the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  Michael Leavitt to address persistent problems that are preventing New Yorkers and enrollees across the country from getting the information and assistance their plans are required to provide them under the Medicare prescription drug program   News reports have highlighted that many participating plans are not addressing concerns and problems of enrollees  instead referring them to the 1 800 MEDICARE hotline   Senator Clinton called on Secretary Leavitt to hold plans accountable and release additional information about enforcement actions taken by the Department   Senator Clinton also called on Secretary Leavitt to release to the public the quality and performance information it collects on participating plans about levels of service provided to consumers  including information about grievances  appeals and complaints   This   report card    of participating plans would help hold them to high standards and help consumers make informed choices about plans   In addition  Senator Clinton noted that new HHS statistics show that nearly 300 000 New Yorkers    10 percent of New Yorkers eligible for Medicare    still have no prescription drug coverage and asked Secretary Leavitt to detail how HHS is working to reach Medicare beneficiaries who are eligible for prescription drug coverage but not enrolled            If the Medicare Part D drug benefit is to succeed  we must be diligent about addressing its shortcomings as soon as they appear  rather than allowing them to continue without any action to enforce the federal standards which should be governing its implementation  It is unacceptable that six months after this program was launched  we are still not able to ensure that all enrollees who have questions about the Part D benefit are able to get timely and accurate answers from their prescription drug plan     Senator Clinton wrote          The following is the text of Senator Clinton  s letter to Secretary Leavitt             The Honorable Mike O  Leavitt  Secretary  United States Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  D C  20201      Dear Mr  Secretary       Six months after the implementation of the Medicare Part D benefit  I am deeply concerned that millions of seniors and persons with disabilities are still not able to obtain correct and timely information from the private insurance plans that are administering this benefit   I urge you to take immediate action to ensure that all plans are providing accurate information to their beneficiaries   If they are not  you should aggressively use your enforcement authority to ensure that errant plans quickly come into compliance with federal standards          In January  I sent two letters to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  Administrator Mark McClellan outlining my concerns about the inability of pharmacists  providers and patients to receive adequate customer service from these plans   In February  you outlined your own concerns in the   Secretary  s One Month Report on the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit     where you stated    I can    and will    take corrective action if a plan is not in compliance with its contractual agreements      Yet despite awareness of these problems  it is unclear if the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  or CMS has taken the corrective action necessary to help our nation  s seniors get accurate information about their care          Earlier this week  you released reports outlining the corrective measures taken by CMS to ensure that drug plans are in compliance with their contracts  but failed to provide additional details that would be useful in truly analyzing the performance of individual plans   I would ask that you immediately release to Congress a full list of the enforcement actions taken by your department against plans that are failing to fulfill CMS guidelines regarding customer service          I understand that insurers participating in the Medicare Part D benefit submit data about the levels of service provided to consumers  including information about grievances  appeals  and complaints   Rather than engage in compliance actions that confuse consumers  such as engaging in the temporary removal of drug plan information from the Personal Plan Finder on the CMS website  I believe you should increase access to quality information for all plans  According to CMS estimates  almost 300 000 Medicare beneficiaries in New York are not enrolled in prescription drug coverage   We need to make sure consumers have all the information they need to make an informed decision and maximize participation for those that will benefit from the program   I would ask that you immediately release the quality service data you collect as a Part D Plan Performance Report Card to both Congress and the public  so we know not only which plans provide the cheapest prices on drugs  but also which plans provide quality customer service  and integrate this information with the Personal Plan Finder          I am also concerned that the criteria used to evaluate plans do not reflect the needs of Medicare beneficiaries   For example  the recent CMS review of call centers found that wait times have been reduced  but did not assess the accuracy of information provided to callers   A New York Times article noted that many insurers are relying upon the 1 800 MEDICARE hotline  which is run by the federal government  rather than addressing the specific concerns of their enrollees with their own customer service departments   Among the calls that have been inappropriately referred to the Medicare hotline are requests for refills of necessary medications  As a result  beneficiaries and their families may find themselves making multiple calls to track down time sensitive information that only their insurer can provide   It is easy enough to resolve a call within five minutes if an operator is merely directing the caller to go elsewhere for information   I am concerned that a taxpayer subsidized hotline is being used to address concerns that are the responsibility of private companies to resolve   I would urge you to ensure that callers are being provided not only with timely  but accurate assistance  and ask that you immediately demonstrate the ways in which you are monitoring the ability of a plan to provide correct information to callers          If the Medicare Part D drug benefit is to succeed  we must be diligent about addressing its shortcomings as soon as they appear  rather than allowing them to continue without any action to enforce the federal standards which should be governing its implementation   It is unacceptable that six months after this program was launched  we are still not able to ensure that all enrollees who have questions about the Part D benefit are able to get timely and accurate answers from their prescription drug plan   I look forward to learning how you plan to address these problems  improve the quality of care received by Medicare beneficiaries  and work to achieve full participation in a benefit that truly addresses the needs of seniors in New York and across the nation          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
