March 3  2006 Strong Bipartisan Group Urges Senate Leaders to Help Implement Goals of Dubai Ports Deal Bill and Ensure That Follow Up Investigation Answers Security Concerns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Republicans and Democrats Continue to Push for Vigorous Congressional Oversight of National and Homeland Security Aspects of Dubai Ports Deal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Today  Senators Chuck Schumer  D NY   Norm Coleman  R MN   Bob Menendez  D NJ   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Susan Collins  R ME   Tom Coburn  R OK   Jack Reed  D RI   Rick Santorum  R PA   and Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  sent a letter to Senate Leaders Bill Frist and Harry Reid urging them to cooperate in efforts to make sure that the security investigation of the Dubai ports deal meets the highest standards for protecting our national security   While a 45 day investigation has finally been requested  there are other safeguards the lawmakers are pushing as part of their bi partisan legislation to protect our national security   Namely  they are insisting that Congress is kept fully informed as the 45 day review progresses  and notified how security concerns are being investigated and addressed  that Congress is provided 30 days to review the results of the report  including reasoning for the decision to either approve or disapprove of the deal  and finally after the 45 day investigation is completed  Congress reserves the ability to vote to disapprove the deal if the security concerns have not been adequately addressed   The Senators agreed that if they need to press for a vote on their legislation or have to introduce further legislation to achieve the goals outlined  they are hoping for cooperation from Leaders Frist and Reid          Schumer said    The more we learn about the CFIUS process  the more questions are raised   Why did they do a 45 day review for tank engines in a box  but not for potential nuclear weapons in a ship  s container   This is not a Democrat or Republican issue    this is about making sure that the American people are safe and secure   Our goal should be to increase port security dramatically  not chip away at it more by allowing a company owned by a country at a nexus with terrorism runs them             I  m proud to join the effort with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to urge for transparency and a thorough review regarding the Dubai Port World s takeover of American ports   said Coleman    In a post 9 11 world  the process of ensuring America s safety and the integrity of our national security infrastructure is as important as ever  Clearly  this letter shows that America  s safety is not a partisan issue  but rather a priority that the Senate has the duty to act on           Menendez stated    While I am pleased the administration is finally undertaking the investigation it should have done in the first place  there are serious questions about both its willingness and its ability to act on the results   With the president prejudging the outcome of the investigation before it even began  it is clearer than ever that Congress will need to take an up or down vote on this sale           Snowe stated    Today a bipartisan group of Senators asked our leadership on both sides of the political aisle to ensure that Congress plays a key role in reviewing the 45 investigation into the Dubai Ports World deal   This is a time sensitive process  and I am hopeful we can work to ensure that the legislative branch has a voice in the final outcome   What is clear is that there are potential national security implications at stake               Security must be our top priority in the post 9 11 world   This 45 day investigation was mandatory under the law and we expect this review to be independent  rigorous  and thorough and that the results of this investigation be shared with the Congress   Congress should take any necessary steps to ensure the Bush Administration does not compromise security at our ports   said Clinton        Collins stated    We have long acknowledged the vulnerability of our ports   both as a potential target and as a conduit through which terrorists  their weapons or other contraband may enter the U S   Coming from a state with three international cargo ports  I am keenly aware of the importance of our seaports to our national economy and to the communities in which they are located   In addition to our ports  economic significance  the link between maritime security and our national security is evident   It is critical that all of the national security concerns raised in discussions related to the purchase of P Ports by DPW are addressed and that Congress is kept fully engaged in the process           Reed said    I remain deeply concerned with the Administration  s seemingly quick decision to approve this contract to manage several of our most important ports  On an issue as sensitive to our national security as this is  I was shocked that the President did not subject this decision to the highest level of scrutiny     Reed stated     I was pleased to cosponsor legislation to give Congress proper oversight of this situation  and it is my hope that the Administration considers all of our concerns highlighted in this legislation             The 45 day investigation provides a critical opportunity to learn more about this transaction   Our primary goal is to protect the American people while preserving our economic vitality  therefore  it is my hope that the investigation will provide a thorough and effective review of the Dubai Ports acquisition   The ports directly affected by this transaction  including the Port of Philadelphia in my state  play a vital role in our nation  s commercial and homeland security activities     Santorum said          The President  s 45 day review is really too little too late   Dubai  s troublesome record on terrorism should disqualify them from owning major operations at our ports   A nation that recognized the Taliban  boycotts Israel  had relations with Osama Bin Laden and allowed nuclear components to go through their own ports should not be minding the store within our borders     said Lautenberg         Dubai Ports World  a Dubai Company that is owned and operated by the United Arab Emirates is about to complete a  6 8 billion deal  which was briskly approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS  last month   The approval allows the UAE  s government owned company to take control of significant operations at six U S  ports including  New York  New Jersey  Baltimore  New Orleans  Miami and Philadelphia  Except for cargo screening functions performed by the Department of Homeland Security  the port operator is responsible for securing cargo coming in and out of the port  the port facility itself  and the hiring of security personnel          Earlier this week the same bipartisan group of senators introduced emergency legislation to suspend the Dubai port deal immediately   Schumer initially announced the legislation with House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King last week   The bill has broad support in the Senate with 21 co sponsors and the House version has over 60 co sponsors          Over the last two weeks since Schumer first criticized this deal  a litany of homeland security professionals have also come out questioning the deal including former DHS Secretary Tom Ridge  former DHS Inspector General Clark Kent Ervin  Republican and Democratic senators and representatives  and governors and mayors around the nation        The letter the Senators sent today is below         Dear Senators Frist and Reid                  As you know  we recently joined together to introduce S  2333  The Foreign Investment Security Act of 2006  a bill to require a 45 day CFIUS investigation and a Presidential determination regarding the national security implications of Dubai Port World  s takeover of Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Navigation Company   This bill stemmed from our joint concern that allowing the takeover of U S  terminal operations after only a cursory review raised serious national security concerns                   The President and the companies have now moved voluntarily to provide for such a 45 day investigation  and we are encouraged by that decision   Though some of us remain troubled about how this new review will proceed given the Administration  s continued support of the deal  we have decided not to press for a vote on our bill at this time in the hope that this new investigation will be thorough  fair  and independent                  Nevertheless  several key components of our legislation have yet to be addressed   namely  the notification to Congress and the ability of Congress to disapprove the deal within thirty days if security concerns are not met                  As a result  we write to ask for your assistance in guaranteeing that       a  the Congress is kept fully informed as the 45 day review progresses  and notified how security concerns are being investigated and addressed        b  the Congress is provided 30 days to review the results of the report  including reasoning for the decision to either approve or disapprove of the deal  and       c  once this 45 day review period is over  Congress reserves the ability to vote to disapprove the deal if the security concerns have not been adequately addressed                            We hope you will work with us and with the Administration to ensure that this review is a thorough  effective look at whether this deal truly poses a threat to our national security   If we need to press for a vote on our legislation or to introduce further legislation to achieve the goals outlined above  we hope you will work with us in the coming weeks   The Administration must know that we stand united to examine and review this deal independently  and that Congress must have a role in determining whether it should go forward or be stopped as a result of national security concerns                                                                      Sincerely      Senator Charles E  Schumer                               Senator Norm Coleman   Senator Robert Menendez                                       Senator Olympia Snowe   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton                                       Senator Susan Collins   Senator Jack Reed                                             Dr  Tom Coburn  M D    Senator Frank Lautenberg                                   Senator Rick Santorum
