September 5  2006 Senator Clinton  Mount Sinai Release the Findings of the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Program that Screened the Health Conditions of Thousands who were First Responders in the Aftermath of Attacks on the World Trade Center Found Persistent Health Problems in Many      60  Still Suffer Respiratory Problems From Exposure To Environment At Site                                                                                                                                            New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined with representatives from the Mount Sinai Medical Center and Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler to release the results of Mount Sinai  s screening program that examines the health effects experienced by first responders who rushed to Ground Zero immediately after the September 11th attacks           Senator Clinton secured the  12 million in federal funding to establish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program at Mount Sinai  The Senator and her colleagues then worked to secure an additional  90 million to expand the number of workers and volunteers eligible for health screenings and to medically monitor their health over a period of five years   Last December  the Senator also worked with her colleagues in the New York Congressional delegation to restore  125 million to New York in 9 11 aid that was rescinded by President Bush for ongoing worker s compensations claims and for health monitoring and treatment for our heroes            I think it was clear from day one to many of us that the air wasn  t safe around Ground Zero and that something had to be done to protect the people who were going in to try to save others  Now we know the problem is even worse than we thought  This is yet another after shock from 9 11 and from the terrorists who struck that day     Senator Clinton said            Today  s findings lay out a more complete picture of what has happened to the men and women who answered the call   Too many of those examined through the medical screening program are disabled as a result of WTC related health problems  which is particularly tragic because they tended to be healthy before 9 11   holding jobs in strenuous professions such as the building trades     Senator Clinton said            No first responder  who answers the call and helps out in a time of need should ever be without healthcare to find and treat the diseases they may be exposed when they reach out to help save lives  This is another painful reminder that we must ensure that the people who serve    who answer the call    are not the last people we think of  but the first   Those who protect us without hesitation deserve the same response from us     the Senator said          According to Mount Sinai  the findings are based upon medical examinations performed between July 2002 and April 2004 on approximately 9 500 WTC responders   These responders were a highly diverse group and included members of the building trades  law enforcement officers  non FDNY firefighters  utilities and telecommunications workers  transit workers  and many others  All received a comprehensive examination that included complete physical examination  mental health evaluation  pulmonary function tests  chest x ray  blood tests and urinalysis   Overall  the monitoring program examined close to 12 000 responders during the 21 month period covered by the study  9 500 of whom agreed to allow their results to be used in this report          The report found that a high proportion of those examined became sick as a result of their World Trade Center work  It found also that illnesses have persisted in the years since September 11 in a high proportion of the workers   In one area alone    pulmonary function tests   the study found WTC responders had abnormalities at a rate twice that expected in the comparable U S  population and that these abnormalities persisted for many months and  in some cases  years after exposure           The study published today focuses on respiratory health consequences  one of the earliest areas of concern to emerge  The study found that many responders were symptomatic  with high rates of pulmonary function abnormalities as long as 2 1 2 years after the disaster    The findings are particularly striking  in that the workers who served at the World Trade Center tended to be vigorous  healthy workers who held jobs in strenuous professions such as the building and utility trades before September 11  Specific findings included               Almost 70 percent of World Trade Center responders had a new or worsened respiratory symptom that developed during or after their time working at the WTC             Among the responders who were asymptomatic before 9 11  61 percent developed respiratory symptoms while working at the WTC             Close to 60 percent still had a new or worsened respiratory symptom at the time of their examination             One third had abnormal pulmonary function tests  much higher than expected   Severe respiratory conditions including pneumonia were significantly more common in the six months after 9 11 than in six months prior           Rates of respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function abnormalities were positively correlated with how early the responders arrived at the World Trade Center site  Those who arrived first at the site suffered the heaviest exposures and had the most frequent respiratory problems  This represents a major public health issue as most of the responders screened by Mount Sinai were heavily exposed  with 70 percent having arrived at the site between September 11 and 13           These results highlight the continuing need for both health monitoring and treatment programs for WTC responders  The World Trade Center Health Effects Treatment Program at Mount Sinai  initiated in 2003 with philanthropic funding  has provided over 14 000 medical and social work services to more than 2000 WTC responders with persistent illnesses  Responders seen in the past year have had  upper respiratory illnesses  84 percent   such as sinusitis  laryngitis  and vocal cord dysfunction  lower respiratory disorders  47 percent  such as asthma and World Trade Center cough  psychological disorders  37 percent  such as post traumatic stress disorder and chronic depression  and musculoskeletal problems  31 percent  often from injuries that occurred while working on the pile          The report concludes that continuing long term medical monitoring of responders will be needed to track the persistence of the abnormalities discovered in the study and to identify late effects  including possible malignancies   Mount Sinai continues to screen responders and has tested an additional 4 000 since April 2004          For more information about the study click here       The program coordinated by the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine  continues to provide free medical screening and monitoring exams   Some 16 000 initial medical screening examinations and 5 000 follow up exams have been provided for WTC responders to date through a number of participating metro area occupational medicine providers   For more information on the program  go to www WTCexams org
