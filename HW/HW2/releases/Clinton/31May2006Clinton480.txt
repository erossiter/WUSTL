May 31  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Cuts to New York  s Homeland Security Grant Program Funding for FY2006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Calls on DHS to Explain its Rationale  Calls for Senate Hearings Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement today on cuts announced by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  to New York  s Homeland Security Grant program funding for fiscal year 2006            Additionally  Senator Clinton is writing to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff requesting an explanation as to how the Department of Homeland Security reached its funding decisions    Senator Clinton is also writing to Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Chairwoman Susan Collins  R ME  and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman  D CT  requesting that their committee hold hearings on the matter         Click here to read Senator Clinton s letter to Secretary Chertoff      Click here to read Senator Clinton s letter to Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman           Senator Clinton  s statement            The Department of Homeland Security should ensure that our limited homeland security funds get to where they are needed most and that our American cities and states living under the greatest threat receive the funding they need to protect themselves from harm   As we approach the solemn and tragic fifth anniversary of the September 11th attacks  we are sadly reminded that New York is on its own when it comes to protecting our citizens from future terrorist attacks            With all of this in mind  it is outrageous that New York will receive more than  106 5 million less in Homeland Security Grant Program  HSGP  funds than it did last year   While I understand that HSGP funds were cut across the board nationwide  DHS slashed New York  s funds by a disproportionately higher amount than most states   Funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative    a program designed to enhance security and overall preparedness to prevent  respond to  and recover from acts of terrorism    was cut in New York City by more than 40 percent and in Buffalo by 48 5 percent    These cuts demonstrate this Administration s continued failure to grasp the unique security threats that face New York   I intend to press Secretary Chertoff for answers about DHS  s calculations   Our nation remains at risk and eliminating funding for areas most in need    like New York    demonstrates a pre 9 11 mentality that we should not tolerate
