                                                                                                                                                                                                                        FEMA and SEMO Agree to Reassess Stump Removals on a Case By Case Basis   FEMA Agrees to Allow More Time for North Tonawanda Reimbursement Claims                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed an agreement by both the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  and New York State Emergency Management Office  SEMO  to work with local authorities in Western New York to reassess their tree stump removal and reimbursement needs following the surprise October snowstorm last year  Both FEMA and SEMO agreed to reassess local stump removal needs on a case by case basis with a view to addressing the hazardous stumps that remain  FEMA also came to an agreement with North Tonawanda officials to allow the city more time to prepare a thorough appeal in their request for reimbursement for costs incurred during debris cleanup following the storm  Todays news came out of two separate meetings held in Buffalo  which Senator Clintons office organized      At a meeting held this morning  FEMA and SEMO agreed to work with local officials to assess each tree stump  Current FEMA policy is to reimburse for the removal of hazardous tree stumps if 50 percent or more of the root ball is exposed  Following the meeting  Senator Clinton said she would continue to push FEMA Director R  David Paulison to change the policy so that FEMA will reimburse for full removal of stumps in the region  At a separate meeting later this afternoon  officials from the city of North Tonawanda met directly with the FEMA representatives who will be reviewing their appeal for reimbursement  FEMAs agreement to allow for the City to take additional time to submit new information in support of their claim came as a direct result of this meeting  FEMA has also offered to work with local officials to address any questions they may have regarding the process     While it has taken a long time and great deal of pressure  I am encouraged that FEMA was willing to come and meet with the local officials today  I am pleased that FEMA has agreed to revisit the issue of the hazardous tree stumps that still cover the region  This is the least we can do for the local communities whose rebuilding and regreening efforts are hampered by the stumps that remain and the excessive cost of their removal  This agreement will hopefully lighten some of the load for local authorities  Senator Clinton said  I remain concerned about FEMAs overall stump removal and reimbursement policy and I will continue to push FEMA Director R  David Paulison to have this policy changed for Western New York  This storm was unprecedented and I am confident that we have a good case to make for full removal and reimbursement assistance from FEMA    It is also encouraging to see FEMA is working with the city of North Tonawanda to resolve their lingering reimbursement issue  While this agreement allows the city more time to gather additional documentation and prepare a thorough case for reimbursement  I urge FEMA to work closely with the local officials to address any concerns and questions they may have  This is a step in the right direction for FEMA and North Tonawanda  and I am hopeful that we will see the process move towards full reimbursement for the city    Representatives from FEMA and SEMO attended both meetings  including Mike Beeman  FEMA Director of National Preparedness Division for Region Two  The morning meeting also included officials from the City of Buffalo  the Town of Clarence  the City and Town of Tonawanda  the Town of Depew  the Town of Cheektowaga  Retree WNY  the City of Amherst  and the Town of West Seneca  Representatives at the afternoon meeting included North Tonawanda Mayor Lawrence Soos  North Tonawanda Superintendent of Public Works Gary Franklin  and North Tonawanda Chief Engineer Dale Marshall    The snowstorm that hit Western New York last October destroyed entire neighborhoods of trees  leaving local communities to clean up debris caused when the trees collapsed under the weight of the snow  While some communities face only a few hundred dollars in tree stump removal costs  many towns face a bill of tens of thousands of dollars  The city of Buffalo is looking at a  1 4 million expense to remove some 7 000 tree stumps throughout the city  and the city of North Tonawanda has already spent more than  845 000 for the removal of roughly 70 000 dangerous limbs and trees that were ravaged during the snowstorm  The citys first request to FEMA for reimbursement was denied   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has long been pushing FEMA to step up and help local communities that were impacted by last Octobers surprise snowstorm by removing the stumps that were left when many trees collapsed under the weight of the snow  Senator Clinton has written to FEMA asking for a change in the policy which currently prevents them from removing tree stumps that do not have exposed roots  so that they can come and remove the stumps that remain  Senator Clinton has also asked FEMA to grant a one year extension for federal reimbursement for stump removal to affected communities and called on FEMA to act
