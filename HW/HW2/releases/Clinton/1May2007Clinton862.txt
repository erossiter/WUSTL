           Legislation Would Address Key National Security Priority by Providing Universal Basic Education by 2015 Click here for audio   Washington  DC   U2 lead singer and co founder of DATA  Debt  Aids  Trade  Africa   Bono  today joined Congresswoman Nita Lowey  D NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Senator Gordon Smith  R OR   and Congressman Spencer Bachus  R AL  to launch the Education for All Act of 2007  which would provide  10 billion over the next five years to help developing countries meet the goal of universal basic education by 2015            Funding from the bill would support activities to train teachers  build schools  develop effective curricula  increase access to school lunch and school health programs  and increase parent and community involvement in schools            The 9 11 Commission recognized the importance of education and cited ensuring educational opportunity as essential to U S  efforts to defeat global terrorism   According to the Commissioners  increasing educational access directly impacts U S  national security because it contributes to global stability and prosperity          At the World Economic Forum in 2000  the U S  joined the international community in setting the goal of achieving universal education by 2015   This goal  in addition to eliminating gender disparity at all levels of education  is also part of the U N  Millennium Development Goals   At this point  however  at least 86 countries are unlikely to reach this target          Today  at least 77 million children of primary school age  a majority of which are girls  are not in school   Worldwide  half of school age children who start primary school drop out   Hundreds of millions more are denied a secondary school education             This legislation is the launching pad of what could be the next American moon shot  universal primary education for the 77 million children around the world who aren t in school because they are too poor  This is a huge  brazen and incredibly smart idea at a time when many are questioning our values in the West  or whether we have any values at all   said Bono  co founder of DATA    Representatives Lowey and Bachus and Senators Clinton and Smith deserve thanks for the vision and leadership they have shown with this legislation  We ll do whatever we can to support their efforts to ensure this bill becomes law and will continue to push governments around the world on this issue            Education is not just a building block  but the cornerstone of free societies   Congresswoman Lowey said    Unstable societies are a breeding ground for terrorists   In countries plagued by violence and strife  diseases like HIV AIDS and Malaria  and poverty  education is an equalizing force   Today more than ever  education is a national security issue   It is the key to turning back the spiraling tide against fanaticism            Every child can learn  Every child can grow up to contribute to his or her family  community  and country   But today  not every child has that chance   said Senator Clinton    We are introducing the Education for All Act because we have the capacity  responsibility  and opportunity to help   All it takes now is the will  and I believe with bipartisan support we can turn this bill into law and we can lead the world in meeting the goal of universal basic education            Access to an education for impoverished youngsters helps them gain success and stability   Senator Smith said    Closing the school house door leaves them on the path to poverty and depravity   Americans want to help those in need  whether they are here at home or abroad   Better coordinating our efforts will improve our effectiveness             America is no longer isolated from countries halfway around the globe   said Congressman Bachus    A painful lesson we all learned in the aftermath of 9 11 is how their instability and poverty can have profound negative economic and social implications for us   Today we are engaged in what is essentially a battle of ideas with our enemies   If we are to win this ideological confrontation  education is both our best defense and our best offense           The Education for All Act is endorsed By  The ONE Campaign  The Basic Education Coalition  The Academy for Educational Development  Save the Children  DATA  The
