May 25  2007 Senators Clinton  Snowe Introduce Legislation to Close Import Loopholes that Threaten our Food Supply and Hurt our Dairy Farmers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Olympia J  Snowe today announced that they have reintroduced a much needed bill to reinforce our support for the nation s dairy producers   The Milk Import Tariff Equity Act is legislation aimed at providing a level playing field for our domestic dairy production by placing a ceiling on the total amount of dairy protein import products entering the U S  at the non tariff rate            Loopholes in the current system are allowing imported dairy products nearly unfettered access to US markets  placing our food supply at potential risk and placing an additional burden on dairy farmers across the country  This legislation will close the unfair loopholes that allow importers to avoid proper tariffs and regulation  With all of the food safety issues that we have experienced in recent months  this bill is more important than ever  This is an effective and fair way to protect our nation s food supply while helping to ensure the long term health of our dairy industry and the communities that it supports   Senator Clinton said           We need to stand up and protect this vital community   This legislation levels the playing field for the thousands of hard working American dairy farmers by closing loopholes that allow their foreign competition to avoid paying the same taxes and regulations they face   said Senator Snowe          Senator Clinton has been a sponsor of the Milk Import Tariff Equity Act in previous congresses  The bill enjoys bipartisan support this year in the Senate in addition to the support of many farm and dairy organizations such as the National Farmers Union  the National Milk Producers Federation  Council of Northeast Farmer Cooperatives and the New York Farm Bureau          Currently  the U S  maintains tariff rate quotas on many dairy products  but did not create tariffs on Milk Protein Concentrate  MPC  and casein as part of the 1994 GATT agreement   A loophole therefore exists in our trade laws  allowing exporters to enter the U S  market with products that displace domestically produced dairy goods  and disrupt our dairy marketing system          U S  imports of MPC have surged since the mid 1990s  rising from 50 million lbs  milk equivalent in 1993  to nearly 200 million lbs  in 2002   Add in the even larger volume of imported casein  and total dairy protein imports averaged nearly 1 billion lbs  annually during the period 2000 2002   MPC import volume increased 16 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 and casein imports were up 13 percent for the same period   In the first five months of 2005  MPC imports are up 57 percent compared to 2004  while casein imports reached record levels in the same period          The surge in imports of MPC and casein has created a negative ripple effect economically for U S  dairy producers  who have suffered from reduced milk sales  lower prices  and a weakened dairy price support program   Farmers lost a total of more than  1 4 billion in 2004 because of these imports          Imports of MPC have displaced domestically produced dairy proteins  which in many cases are substitutes for MPC  particularly in cheese products   What s more  the build up of government skim milk powder surpluses is the result of growing MPC imports          The Milk Import Tariff Equity Act  MITEA   offers a fair  equitable  affordable and WTO legal solution to an ongoing problem facing America s 70 000 dairy farm families  The bill places tariff rate quotes on imports of certain casein and milk protein concentrates while allowing dairy processors to maintain access to imported as well as domestic dairy proteins          The authority granted to the President by the MITEA legislation would ensure that the new tariffs on MPC and casein imports are negotiated in a WTO consistent manner   Nothing prevents a WTO member from renegotiating its tariff concessions under provisions clearly outlined in the 1994 GATT agreement   Many world agricultural tariffs have already been adjusted in a similar fashion
