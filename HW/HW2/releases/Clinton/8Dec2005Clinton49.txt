

                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer  D NY  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   and Congressman Michael R  McNulty  D Green Island   announced today that the U S  Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to participate in planning and advisory meetings on the remediation and repair of the Gilboa Dam in southern Schoharie County beginning this week        At the request of local officials  Schumer  Clinton  and McNulty wrote to the Corps last month seeking their immediate involvement in the assessment and planning process  in coordination with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection  NYCDEP   which operates the Gilboa Dam as part of the New York City watershed supply system          This is a good step that the Army Corps of Engineers understands the urgency of this issue     Schumer said    We will continue to work with them  the City of New York DEP  and leaders in the Schoharie Valley to make sure this problem is dealt with in a timely fashion  The bottom line is  all responsible authorities must work together to make sure the Gilboa Dam is safe and secure             I am pleased that the Corps has answered our call for help  These two agencies have so much experience in taking care of these issues  so I am glad that they are now coming together to help us with Gilboa Dam     Senator Clinton said    We need to take every step to ensure the safety of the communities below the Gilboa dam  I hope that with both the Corps and NYC Department of Environmental Protection involved we can get this done as soon as possible and get it done right           McNulty said    Our number one concern is for the safety of our constituents   Over the years  the level of trust held by residents of Schoharie County in New York City officials has deteriorated  and the City Department of Environmental Protection  s recent flurry of activity and sudden concern has not provided much reassurance   The participation of the Army Corps   in this week  s advisory group meetings will help restore that confidence   I thank the Corps not only for their responsiveness  but also for their willingness to assist the NYCDEP in any way they can           The following is the body of the letter of reply from the Army Corps of Engineers to Schumer  Clinton and McNulty  dated December 5  2005        This is in response to the November 16  2005  letter from Senators Schumer and Clinton and you regarding Gilboa Dam in New York   Gilboa Dam spans Schoharie Creek in southern Schoharie County and is part of the water supply system operated by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection  NYCDEP    Several mayors of downstream municipalities have expressed concern regarding the efforts of NYCDEP to ensure the dam  s safety and requested that the U S  Army Corps of Engineers coordinate with NYCDEP to provide expert assistance in resolution of the problems        Members of the Corps New York District have been in touch with representatives of NYCDEP to determine how the Corps can be of assistance   As you are aware  NYCDEP has a long term plan for rehabilitation of its system of dams   Work on Gilboa Dam is scheduled to start in the spring and be finished by the 2010 2011 timeframe   In the meantime  some immediate interim remedial measures including notching of the spillway and installation of rock anchors are proposed to help stabilize the dam until the full remediation can be completed   The Corps has been requested to participate in a   technical advisory group    workshop in early December at which NYCDEP will present and discuss these measures   We anticipate having representatives attend from our Dam Safety  Emergency Operations  and Regulatory offices   We will continue to coordinate with NYCDEP to determine if any additional assistance is required        Sincerely        Steven L  Stockton  P E   Deputy Director of Civil Works  U S  Army Corps of Engineers       The following is the text of the letter from McNulty  Clinton and Schumer to the U S  Army Corps of Engineers  dated November 16  2005           November 16  2005     LTG Carl A  Strock  Chief of Engineers and Commander  U S  Army Corps of Engineers  Government Accountability Office Building  441 G Street  NW Attn  CECS C  Washington  DC 20314       Dear General Strock        Enclosed please find a copy of a communication we have received from several mayors in Schoharie County  New York        The condition of New York City s Gilboa Dam  which is located in southern Schoharie County  has deteriorated in recent years to the point where it has been declared unstable   The New York City Department of Environmental Protection which controls the dam and has jurisdiction over safety concerns  recently ordered that interim emergency measures be taken to stabilize the dam this coming spring  and that full rehabilitation of the dam occur in 2010 11        Understandably  this has raised grave concern among our constituents in the Schoharie Valley  who have been frustrated by the lack of attention given to the dam by the City of New York for many years   The sudden attention and disclosure by the City is particularly distressing and unnerving for our constituents        We respectfully request the immediate assistance of the Army Corps of Engineers in assessing the stability of the Gilboa Dam and plotting the course of action required for repairs   Working in conjunction with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection  the Army Corps has the resources and credibility necessary to make the proper assessment of the state of the dam and the danger it may pose to neighboring villages   thus restoring confidence among our constituents in their public safety officials        Your consideration of this request is deeply appreciated   We look forward to your prompt reply        Sincerely      Charles E  Schumer  United States Senate       Hillary Rodham Clinton  United States Senate                    Michael R  McNulty  Member of Congress
