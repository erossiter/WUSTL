                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Funding included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized  76 5 million for defense projects and military construction benefiting the Capital Region   The  48 1 million for defense projects will include  5 million for Superpower  s High Temperature Superconductor Generators   32 4 million for the M777 Howitzer which benefits Watervliet Arsenal   2 5 million for Benet Labs  s ATLAS Raven   3 million for MTI Microfuel Cells   Hybrid Advanced Soldier Power program   2 million for Plug Power  s Fuel Cell for Continuity of Operations program  and  2 million for Starfire System  s FIRST program  In addition  the Committee approved  28 4 million in military construction funding for the region  including  5 5 million for the Army National Guard Readiness Center in Latham   3 million for the Army National Guard Readiness Center in Leeds and  19 9 million for the Navy Joint Reserve Center in Albany        The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2006 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill   The bill will now be sent to the Senate for approval          The Capital Region is already taking advantage of tremendous development opportunities for civilian and defense companies alike  This funding will only add to the region  s potential to support our troops and stimulate economic development     Senator Clinton said    I will continue to work to generate these meaningful investments so that we can build on the region  s potential to generate economic growth while supporting our national security           Superpower    High Temperature Superconductor Generators   5 Million  SuperPower is working to achieve commercial scale manufacturing of second generation High Temperature Superconducting  HTS  wire using yttrium barium copper oxide  2G wire  beginning in 2006  2G wire can provide immense benefits in electric power devices such as generators  motors  power cables  and transformers   HTS generators can produce the equivalent amount of electrical power as conventional generators  while requiring drastically smaller size and weight   The Navy has made a decision to implement electric drive on the next class of surface combatants and over the longer term to move towards all electric surface ships and submarines in future ship classes  The resulting electric plant architecture will enable electric warships to quickly divert a ship  s propulsion power for use by state of the art electrical based weapons and advanced long range sensors   The reduced size of the HTS generators is of particular relevance to the Navy for this application because it allows increased flexibility in ship architecture and enhanced power density and transient response  improving overall ship performance and survivability        Watervliet Arsenal    M777 Howitzer   32 4 Million  The M777A1 will be replacing the current M198 howitzer that had been in service for over 25 years   The M777 is a joint program for the U S  Marine Corps and the U S  Army   This technology will provide increased mobility  accuracy  and armament   Watervliet Arsenal produces the tubes for the M777 Howitzer  This funding increase will provide for and additional 14 M777 howitzers        Benet Labs    ATLAS Raven   2 5 Million  Funding of  2 5 million was authorized for the Advanced Technology Lightweight Armament System Rarefaction Wave Gun  ATLAS  Raven Benet Labs at Watervliet Arsenal  ATLAS supports the current Army Vision by setting the basis for the development of ultra lightweight combat vehicles that will significantly enhance the ability of all services to rapidly deploy to trouble spots worldwide with a suite of extremely lethal  agile  and survivable vehicles  The ATLAS system will provide the enabling technologies for unprecedented reductions in the weight  up to 50   of large caliber high muzzle energy cannons  These weight reductions in the gun system will in turn bring the vehicle weight well under the 14 ton limit required for air transportability        The weight reductions will be achieved through the use of the Sonic Rarefaction Wave Gun  Raven   which has been demonstrated to reduce recoil impulse by 75  and bore heating by 50  with no loss of muzzle energy  The Raven concept functions just like a high velocity cannon until the projectile has traveled a predetermine distance down bore  At this time the breech is opened allowing the propellant gases to vent out the breech through a diverging nozzle thus generating forward thrust canceling much of the recoil force  Funding supported by this request would be utilized to define the materials and design requirements  perform initial engineering analysis  and develop composite materials  optimize manufacturing technologies and develop demonstrators of ATLAS structures        MTI Microfuel Cells    Hybrid Advanced Soldier Power   3 Million  Recognizing the fact that no single power source  battery nor fuel cells  will provide acceptable man portable power to meet the 72 hour operational requirement of many Department of Defense initiatives  funding will go towards the development of a hybrid fuel cell battery portable system   While a unique concept  this hybrid fuel cell battery concept is currently in use on a limited production basis in the commercial arena   The current program will incorporate advances in both Fuel Cell and Lithium Ion batteries to demonstrate a   real world    power system appropriate for 72 hour autonomous operation missions and with the flexibility to support currently fielded soldier systems  The successful completion of the Hybrid Advanced Soldier Power program will provide the critical portable power technology needed to meet increased mission requirements and weight limitations of today  s Armed Forces   This technology will also provide solutions for future portable power and associated logistical issues driven by the proliferation of electric devices unique to soldiers        Plug Power    Fuel Cell for Continuity of Operations   2 Million  The Department of Defense has a comprehensive and effective Defense Continuity Program  DCP  that ensures that Component Mission Essential Functions  MEF  continue under all circumstances across the spectrum of threats  including terrorist attack or grid failure   DCP planning relies on the use of dispersed locations  which require a unique portable power solution to support operations  one that not only provides extended run power but also can be safely operated indoors    To optimize fuel cell technology for this application  Plug Power will help develop and deliver to DOD  s Counter Terrorism Technology Support Office prototype fuel cell power generators for testing and evaluation   Demonstrations will be a part of the activity and the participants will establish procedures for monitoring  data collection  testing  evaluation  and reporting    The project report will evaluate the capability of fuel cell technology to meet identified DOD continuity requirements        Starfire Systems    FIRST program   2 Million  The Functionally Reactive Surfaces Technologies Program  FIRST  is continuing a Department of Defense initiative that would establish a  one stop shop  for research  development  systems integration  and technology transfer of surface reactive technologies into functional materials and devices for specialized clothing  sensors  tools and materials structures operating in hazardous environments  The technologies would be able to detect and automatically ameliorate the threat of any injury to the soldier on the battlefield as well as allow first responders to operate unimpeded or with enhanced capability for longer periods of time in the presence of biological  chemical  and fire threats  Functionally enhanced  renewable  biosurfaces in textile fiber or multifilm form will not only be able to neutralize bio and chemical attack but will also perform tissue repair and serve as an interface for enhanced sensory perception        The limiting factors that prevent this capability today are the lack of miniaturized wearable electronic components   The individual sensor  integral power  and active fabric technologies all need to be integrated  monitored wirelessly  and be intelligently controlled by an electronic circuit using minimal power   The goal of this step in the project is to demonstrate a level sufficient to fabricate a prototype integrated multi sensor package that can be evaluated in actual garment testing for soldiers   The textile patch hybrid circuit will support the integration and control of diverse technologies such as temperature sensors  chemical sensors  active features for physical comfort  and a textile based rechargeable battery  all integrated into a fire protective textile garment for both soldiers and domestic first responders        Latham Army National Guard Readiness Center   5 5 million  The Armed Services Committee bill includes  5 5 million to provide a readiness center addition  of permanent type construction  to serve the peace time missions of the assigned units and space for all personnel to perform necessary wartime missions as well        Leeds Army National Guard Readiness Center   3 million  The Armed Services Committee bill includes  3 million to provide an armory addition and alteration  of permanent type construction  to serve the peace time missions of the assigned units and space for all personnel to perform necessary wartime missions as well        Navy Joint Reserve Center   19 9 million  The Armed Services Committee bill includes  19 970 000 to construct a new Armed Forces Reserve Center at the Schenectady County Airport to support Navy  Marine Corps and Army National Guard drilling reservists
