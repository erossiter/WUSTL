January 3  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on DHS  s Restructuring of the Urban Areas Security Initiative Grants Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I have long advocated for a homeland security funding plan that recognizes that New York and other high threat targets need and deserve more funds to adequately protect our citizens   We need to make sure that our limited homeland security funds get to where they are needed most and that our American cities and states living under the greatest threat receive the funding they need to protect themselves   So while I applaud today  s announcement by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  that it will focus more keenly on risk in its decisions on how to distribute Urban Areas Security Initiative  UASI  grants  I remain concerned that our most vulnerable cities will not receive their fair share of funding   I am hopeful that DHS is moving towards fixing these chronic funding problems  but it is still unclear what results will accompany the Department  s noble intentions
