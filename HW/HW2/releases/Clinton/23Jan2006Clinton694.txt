                                                                                                                                                                                                                        New York   Amid continuing reports of disarray in the implementation of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit program  Senator Clinton visited Buffalo  Rochester and Syracuse area pharmacies and called for immediate action to aid local pharmacists and seniors who are bearing the brunt of the problems plaguing the new program   At each stop  Senator Clinton was joined by upstate pharmacists  seniors and advocates to outline some of the specific challenges facing the hundreds of thousand New York seniors who are dependent on the Medicare prescription drug program             The new prescription drug benefit has created unnecessary obstacles for far too many New Yorkers who can least afford it    our poorest  most vulnerable seniors and disabled     Senator Clinton said    To date  the Bush Administration has failed to adequately address these problems   That  s why I have introduced legislation to fix the problems plaguing the program   It is time for leadership and action   We owe it to our seniors and disabled Americans to get this right             Senator Clinton outlined legislation that she recently introduced with her Senate colleagues in the Democratic Caucus and how it would address the problems plaguing implementation of the new program   The comprehensive legislation includes measures that Senator Clinton called for to ensure that states are reimbursed by the federal government for taking emergency action to keep access to medications for our most vulnerable  to increase the resources for outreach and education for beneficiaries and to ensure that telephone hotlines are able to handle high volumes of inquiries  and to protect seniors who also have coverage from a retiree health plan   The comprehensive bill also includes a measure Senator Clinton introduced in December to help those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid transition into the new Medicare prescription drug benefit by requiring outreach and education to pharmacies on dually eligible beneficiaries and waiving the transaction fees that pharmacies incur when assisting these beneficiaries           Senator Clinton today also held a forum in Rochester  bringing together local community  business and health care leaders to focus attention on the ongoing crisis facing our health care system   The forum  Taking Action on Health Care  was held at Strong Memorial Medical Center and attracted well over 100 stakeholders from the Rochester area to discuss issues including affordability  quality and access           During her opening remarks  Senator Clinton outlined some of the major challenges affecting the health care system  our country is not getting its money  s worth for its health care dollars  we spend more per person than any nation in the world yet our life expectancy ranks thirty fourth and more than 45 million Americans don  t have any health insurance at all  including 13 million children  the incentives inside our health care system are backwards and the payment system is upside down  too often paying for costly and debilitating treatment but not for low cost prevention  and the market now rewards businesses that unload health care costs onto employees and local governments  while punishing companies that try to do the right thing          Senator Clinton emphasized that the Bush Administration s health care agenda will only make problems worse  leaving families and businesses on their own  and she highlighted her work in the Senate to tackle these problems  including efforts to               Create an interoperable health IT infrastructure  marrying technology and quality to reduce medical errors  help contain costs and improve the care patients receive              Help patients make better  more informed choices by supporting comparative effectiveness studies to determine the most appropriate  safe  and cost effective treatments             Improve access to home and community based services that help seniors remain in their homes and communities   and provide tax credits for those who purchase long term care insurance             Create small business purchasing pools    like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP  and provide small businesses  including self employed Americans living and working at home  with tax credits for offering coverage  adding affordable choices and increasing purchasing power             Invest in our nurses through initiatives like the magnet hospital program Senator Clinton secured in the Nurse Reinvestment Act  and            Increase the focus of health care to include prevention             Senator Clinton is working on all fronts to tackle our health care challenge   She has collaborated with Senator Bill Frist to pass legislation in the Senate that would create an interoperable health IT infrastructure   She has joined with Senator Lindsey Graham to expand access to TRICARE military health care benefits for members of our National Guard and Reserve and worked tirelessly to make sure our veterans have the medical care they need and deserve   She has introduced legislation to fix problems plaguing the new Medicare prescription drug benefit   And  as co founder and co chair of the Senate Manufacturing Caucus  she is at the front lines of examining how we can help our manufacturers cope with the crushing costs of healthcare benefits   Senator Clinton has also fought to increase federal health care dollars for New York to ease cost pressures on local budgets and to enable more low income New York families to access healthcare coverage  helping secure a temporary increase in the federal matching rate for Medicaid which brought  1 4 billion to our state and cosponsoring legislation to extend the availability of the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   providing nearly  1 billion in additional funding for New York        Click here to read the full text of Senator Clinton s
