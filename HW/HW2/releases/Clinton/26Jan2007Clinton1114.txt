January 26  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on President to Fund the Healthy  High Performance Schools Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   In a letter sent today  Senator Clinton called on President Bush to include funding for the Healthy  High Performance Schools  HHPS  Program in his 2008 Budget  This program is designed to address prevalent health problems children face as a result of being exposed to lead  mold and toxic chemicals at their schools by providing grants to help school districts make their buildings healthier  safer and more energy efficient             The Healthy  High Performance Schools Program is critical in providing schools with much needed funding to create healthy learning environments  Currently  schools are forced to delay the purchase of necessary instructional supplies because of increasing energy costs and budgets too small to cover maintenance  Many times these schools are even faced with cutting teachers and other instructional personnel     said Senator Clinton           The HHPS Program will provide schools with proper funding to ensure they meet federal and state health codes  According to a report from the General Accounting Office  almost half of all U S  schoolchildren are attending schools with at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition  These conditions have led to many health problems such as coughing  headaches  carbon monoxide poisoning  and increased incidence of asthma along with more severe asthma attacks  As a result of these health problems  children are missing more and more school days  which adversely impacts their academic performance           According to the New York Academy of Science  20 25 percent of students in low income areas of New York state suffer from asthma  which is more than double the national average  A study by the American Lung Association and American Federation of Teachers found that fully funding the HHPS program could reduce rates of asthma in schools by 25 percent on average  And according to the School Management and Planning Magazine s 2006 Construction Report  last year alone  82 percent of school districts in New York State had an operations budget shortfall because of energy costs  By becoming energy efficient  these schools could save 30 percent on their energy costs  according to the Environmental Protection Agency          Senator Clinton has led the effort to have this program included as part of the President  s budget since the HHPS program was signed into law in 2001  She also fought for this program to be included in the No Child Left Behind Act that was enacted in 2002          The full text of the letter sent to President Bush is below          The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  The White House  Washington  DC 20500      Dear Mr  President       I am writing to urge you to include funding for the Healthy  High Performance Schools  HHPS  program in the fiscal year 2008 budget proposal you will soon submit to Congress  If funded  the HHPS program would improve the attendance  performance  and health of millions of children across the country          Funding for the HHPS program would provide grants to help local educational agencies ensure that their schools meet federal and state health codes and employ environmentally sound practices that can lead to reduced energy costs           The Healthy  High Performance Schools program is needed as more and more children are falling ill due to the poor conditions found in their schools  A recent study sponsored by the American Lung Association and the American Federation of Teachers estimates that a shift from an unhealthy to healthy school would result in a 25 percent reduction in cases of asthma among students  Asthma is the leading cause of school absences in the U S   accounting for more than 14 million missed school days each year  a number that could decrease dramatically by funding this program           The environmental conditions of schools can also affect the teachers and school staff  as several reports have also indicated higher rates of asthma among educational workers than any other profession  A study by the U S  Department of Education concluded that poor environments in schools  due primarily to the effects of indoor air pollutants  adversely influence the health  performance  and attendance of students            In addition to preventing health problems among our youth and educators  the Healthy  High Performance School program will allow many schools to achieve energy efficiency  potentially saving over  1 5 billion for schools nationwide   Our nation  s schools spent over  8 billion on energy costs last school year  an increase of  2 billion in just four years  These skyrocketing energy prices are causing officials to make very difficult decisions on cutting back much needed academic programs in efforts to keep the heat and lights on in their schools  Fully funding this program will save these school districts money that could be rededicated to numerous other educational resources  like books  computers or more training for our teachers            By including this program in the No Child Left Behind Act  Congress acknowledged that environmental factors can be a barrier to academic achievement as well as the Federal government  s compelling interest in addressing these issues  We have an obligation to our children to ensure that the school buildings where they spend so much of their time are safe and free from dangerous environmental conditions           The Healthy  High Performance Schools program will give schools the tools they need to save money on energy  make our schools environmentally friendly  and address children s health problems before they start   I urge you to include funding for this critical program in your fiscal year 2008 budget proposal and thank you for your consideration of this request           Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton
