                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC   Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today called upon the Secretary of Agriculture to release funds for critical programs that will provide much needed relief for New York farmers hard hit by recent flooding   The United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency recently released agricultural damage estimates that show over 200 000 acres were affected and over  30 8 million were lost in damage to farmland  buildings and crops          In a letter to USDA Secretary Johanns  the Senators called on the USDA to make adequate funding available for the existing programs that are critical for helping farmers and communities recover from this devastating event  including the Emergency Watershed Protection Program  the Emergency Conservation Program and the Crop Disaster Program   The Senators also called for consideration of a crop indemnity program similar to the one provided for farmers who suffered losses during Hurricane Katrina              The flooding in upstate New York has hit farmers incredibly hard   They are suffering huge losses in crops  equipment and facilities   Farmers are the backbone of our upstate economy and when they are devastated the whole state feels the impact of the damage   Helping our farmers remains a top priority  as we make sure every flood victim gets aid  USDA needs to step up and ensure the federal dollars will be available for New York  s farmers     said Senator Schumer             New York farmers play a vital role in the state economy and should be provided with the programs and assistance they need to get back on their feet   Farmers across the impacted areas have suffered terrible losses and now need help to repair their buildings  clean up their farmland and attempt to salvage their farm operations     Senator Clinton said     As we reach out to help everyone who was impacted by these terrible floods  we must also provide the necessary immediate and longer term assistance to help our farmers recover from their devastating losses              Below are the estimates of acreage affected and average crop losses in some of the flood affected counties

 A copy of the Senators   letter is attached           12th July 2006      The Honorable Mike Johanns  Secretary  United States Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue  SW  Washington  DC 20250      Dear Secretary Johanns       We are writing to urge you to provide agriculture disaster assistance to New York farmers who have been adversely affected by flood related losses as a result of severe storm events at the end of last month          Record setting heavy rains throughout June  and the current severe flooding coupled with historic high energy prices  creates a situation that many producers will not be able to handle financially   The Federal Emergency Management Agency has declared that 19 counties in the Southern Tier  Eastern and Central New York are eligible for public disaster assistance including  Broome  Chenango  Cortland  Delaware  Fulton  Greene  Hamilton  Herkimer  Madison  Montgomery  Oneida  Otsego  Rensselaer  Schenectady  Schoharie  Sullivan  Tioga  Tompkins  and Ulster Counties   These affected areas include important agricultural regions of New York State            Preliminary reports from flooded areas indicate that New York suffered severe crop losses  farmland damage and property damage  The Farm Service Agency today released estimates of crop loss and damages that total more than 200 000 affected acres at a loss of over  30 8 million dollars   Crop replant options may be not available because of excessively wet and rubble strewn fields even after flood waters recede  and high energy prices exacerbate additional planting costs  Furthermore  in many of the flooded areas  the date that crops can be successfully replanted either has already passed  or is fast approaching           In Schoharie County alone over 35 000 acres of agricultural land have been affected with extensive physical and structural damage and crop loss  Three other counties  Chenango  Delaware and Sullivan  have estimated losses on more than 20 000 acres each   Additional losses will be incurred due to loss of milk production and future crop loss   Most counties have been estimating average crop losses ranging between 25 50   and Tioga County is reporting total crop losses of 100  damage   Many dairy and livestock farms have struggled to harvest the first crop of hay due to extremely wet weather in June   As a result  farmers are anticipating a major shortage of forages to feed their herds over the coming months  and they will not have the financial reserves to purchase the feed required   There is little doubt that many producers will not be able to sustain their livelihoods unless decisive action is taken at the federal level to assist our farmers in recovering from their losses           We know that the issuance of a Disaster Declaration now provides farmers with the opportunity to access low interest emergency loans but we would also request that you consider a crop indemnity program similar to the one provided for farmers who suffered losses during Hurricane Katrina   Our farmers also need immediate assistance to implement a cover crop program that will provide green cover  reduce future erosion  and will provide some forage for animals in the area          In addition  we are also calling upon the USDA to make adequate funding available for the existing programs that are critical for helping farmers and communities recover from this devastating event  including the Emergency Watershed Protection Program  the Emergency Conservation Program and the Crop Disaster Program   Funds from these programs were used during previous flood events in New York State and were invaluable for the rebuilding of the farming sector at that time            Agriculture is the primary economic driver in upstate New York  especially in the region that was hard hit by the flooding   Federal government assistance to help New York farmers recover from these devastating losses is essential   Please do not hesitate to contact our offices if you need further information   We look forward to working with you on this issue in the future           Sincerely       Senator Charles E  Schumer                  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton
