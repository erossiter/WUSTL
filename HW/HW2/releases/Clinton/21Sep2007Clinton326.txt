September 21  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Passage of FDA Reauthorization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   Yesterday the Senate passed the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act  legislation to implement increased safety protections and reauthorize the drug user fee program which funds many of the activities of the FDA  I am pleased that this legislation implements further mechanisms to ensure the safety of the prescription drugs for American consumers  because over the past few years I have raised concerns about the ways in which ideology  rather than science  influences the actions of this agency  With Senate passage  we are making progress toward restoring the FDAs reputation as the gold standard for unbiased consumer protection     These provisions will help the agency improve the availability of safe and effective treatments for our children  and include provisions from the Pediatric Research Improvement Act  which I introduced earlier this year  The Pediatric Research Improvement Act reauthorizes the pediatric rule  which gives the FDA the authority to ensure that drugs marketed to children are safe and effective for use in pediatric populations  In addition  this legislation will increase transparency into the FDAs decision making process  ensuring that pediatric drug assessments are reviewed by scientists with pediatric expertise  and improving public availability of essential information about medications for children     While I am pleased that we managed to make so many improvements to current law  I am deeply disappointed that this final bill maintains the sunset of the pediatric rule  We would never dream of placing a sunset on the ability of the FDA to ensure that drugs for adults are safe and effective  and we should ensure that the same protections exist for our pediatric populations  There should be no sunset on the pediatric rule  and I will continue to work with my colleagues to make this important pediatric protection permanent   In addition  I am deeply disappointed that we were not able to include legislation to allow competition in the biotech drug market   Legislation I have championed with Senators Kennedy  Enzi  and Hatch would allow the approval of safe generic versions of these expensive products which is critical to reducing drug costs for all Americans   I will continue to push for enactment of this critical proposal this year
