May 11  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on NSA s Collection of Domestic Call Records                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON  DC     Like many Americans  I am deeply disturbed by today  s revelations about the NSA   We all deserve to know why the NSA has blocked the Department of Justice from investigating the NSA  s domestic surveillance program and why it has created an enormous database of Americans   phone records            Today  s revelations further demonstrate what happens to our Constitution  laws  and privacy when there is no meaningful congressional oversight of the president  s actions   Congress needs to get to the bottom of this   I join my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in demanding answers about the NSA  s domestic surveillance program and the NSA  s use of Americans   phone records   We must defend our homeland while also defending our Constitution  laws  and privacy
