                Penn Yan  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced a  100 000 grant from Bank of America to expand the Finger Lakes Access to Business Capital  FLABC  Partnership   Senator Clinton joined with entrepreneurs  education and business leaders from across Yates County last year to launch the program  which provides critical resources to small and micro businesses throughout the Finger Lakes region   The new grant announced today will allow the FLABC to build on these efforts by expanding business training opportunities for microenterprises  businesses with five or fewer employees          Our smallest entrepreneurs  which make up nearly 19  of New York State  s employment base  need access to the services and capital that will help them grow and thrive     said Senator Clinton     Today  s announcement is another great step along the way to building a stronger small business community throughout New York State           Over the last year  the partnership has been hard at work reaching out to promising new small businesses to provide access to capital and the business training they need to get off the ground and grow   The grant presented today will allow the Enterprise Center at the Rural Opportunities Assistance Program  one of the partners in FLABC  to provide aggressive small business development training in the Finger Lakes   With the funding from Bank of America and assistance from the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development secured by Senator Clinton  Rural Opportunities will establish the Finger Lakes Microenterprise Assistance Program  FLMAP  to provide existing and start up microenterprises in Yates and Ontario Counties with free business training and technical assistance as well as access to loan capital             In the course of this year  the ABC partners learned that many of our small entrepreneurs were not quite ready for financing or loans   Access to capital is extremely important  but first businesses need to have business know how and strategic plans in hand so they know how best to use those funds     said Senator Clinton    The Microenterprise Assistance Program we are launching today will help fill this need              It  s been tremendously rewarding working with both the Senator and Bank of America   Both truly understand how important economic development is to small communities   This type of program is the future of rural economies in New York and is a model for the country     said Dana Brunett  President of the Enterprise Center at ROI         This  100 000 grant from The Bank of America Charitable Foundation represents a substantial investment in the economic development and vitality of upstate New York   said Anne M  Finucane  president  Northeast region  Bank of America   By assisting small businesses and microenterprises throughout the region  Bank of America is fueling the area s economic engine  leading to increased opportunities for more New Yorkers  We are proud to work closely with Senator Clinton and ROI on this important initiative and look forward to building upon this productive partnership         The Finger Lakes MAP Program will target entrepreneurs interested in starting and owning their own business   Owners of existing microenterprises are also eligible if they wish to expand their business  increase their business knowledge and provide employment opportunities for other individuals          Prospective entrepreneurs will be selected through a competitive screening process and those selected for the program will attend a 12 week training course   Through this course the participants will develop a written business plan that can be used as a roadmap for starting and operating their business and to seek funding for their business        The Enterprise Center at Rural Opportunities will establish training sites throughout the Finger Lakes region starting with Keuka College in Yates County   Classes will begin in early 2006        Senator Clinton has long been a leader in small and micro business development   She helped create The Northern Adirondack Trading Co operative  NATC  project which has generated over  500 000 in sales for the bottom lines of participating businesses in the Adirondacks   Following NATC s tremendous success  Senator Clinton launched the Finger Lakes Trading Co operative  FLTC  in New York s Finger Lakes region   As an advocate for the smallest business enterprises and she helped launch MicroBizNY  New York s Statewide Microenterprise Association
