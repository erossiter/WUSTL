                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Funding for New York included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee      Bill also includes provisions to address continuing pay problems for wounded soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee had authorized  14 9 million in Defense projects that will benefit the Capital Region  including  2 5 million for Benet Labs   Rarefaction Wave Gun and  12 4 million for the Lightweight 155 mm Towed Howitzer which has its cannon assembly manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal            The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2007 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill yesterday   The passage of the bill marks the first stage in the Department of Defense appropriations process  Now that the authorization bill has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  the bill will be sent to the Senate floor before heading into the appropriations process  The House of Representatives passed their version of the bill Wednesday            This bill is important not only for our potential military capabilities  but for New York  s economy  In addition to enabling our soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines to have the best training  the best equipment and the best facilities in the world  it makes a number of significant investments in local technology and local companies  which is always welcome     Senator Clinton said    New York companies are already developing the cutting edge technology that will take our military into the future  I am pleased that we can continue to support them and the local economy with these kinds of meaningful investments              Senator Clinton announced that the bill contained a number of highlights for New York  including            The preservation of over  200 million in funding military construction projects for New York which were included in the President  s Budget and which Senator Clinton fought hard to maintain           The preservation of funding for the VH 71A Presidential Helicopter Program  Lockheed Martin Owego is the prime contractor on the program  and          The inclusion of a provision  which Senator Clinton proposed  to name the new laboratory building at the Air Force Research Site in Rome  NY in honor of retiring Rep  Sherwood L  Boehlert  R New Hartford    Rep  John M  McHugh  R Pierrepont Manor  also secured a companion amendment in House defense authorization legislation              During his distinguished Congressional career  Sherry Boehlert has been the foremost champion in Congress of the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome   With his impending retirement from Congress  it is only fitting that we name the new laboratory building after Congressman Boehlert     said Senator Clinton          The bill also included two important amendments that Senator Clinton sponsored to force the Department of the Army to address serious concerns regarding pay issues of wounded soldiers and to analyze troop readiness          In a continuing effort to ensure that those who have given so much are not further burdened with resolving pay account issues  Senator Clinton  s wounded soldier pay audit amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a toll free call assistance center focused on providing wounded members of the Armed Forces  or their primary next of kin  with help relating to military pay issues   The Senator  s amendment also requires the Department of the Army to conduct an audit of its wounded soldiers   pay accounts and report back to Congress in 120 days   As recently as April 26  2006  a Government Accountability Office report found that nearly 1 300 battle injured soldiers and soldiers killed in combat in the first 4 years of the Global War on Terror  had incurred a total of  1 5 million in debt   Press reports have also revealed that the Army has granted more than 600 requests by soldiers for debt forgiveness   totaling more than  600 000   on the basis that the debt was wrongly charged  This is just the latest in a series of actions taken by Senator Clinton on this significant issue as the treatment of wounded soldiers remains one of her top priorities   In the past  she has called on Congress to hold hearings  written to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army to investigate specific cases  and called for reviews of the broader problems with the pay process  particularly as it applies to those wounded in a combat zone            I am deeply troubled  as I think we all should be  about continuing reports of soldiers who have been withdrawn from combat on the basis of medical issues and have experienced payroll problems or have been wrongly charged for certain services or equipment   It is simply unacceptable that we should be billing our soldiers for debts wrongly incurred or exacerbated by bureaucratic pay and personnel systems     Senator Clinton said     We must do everything in our power to avoid placing wounded soldiers in the position of having to resolve payroll problems or to request debt forgiveness  These warriors are recovering from the injuries they sustained while they were fighting for our country and they should not have to deal with this kind of additional burden             Senator Clinton  s amendment addressing our military  s readiness is part of a continuing effort to study the current state of our ground forces and better highlight where Congress should focus its efforts to ensure the continued preparedness of our Army and Marine Corps            I am concerned about the strain on the ground forces of our Nation  s military and their ability to continue at the current pace in Iraq  Afghanistan  and other theaters of operation   We must continue to focus on recruiting and retaining our forces  training and equipping them in a manner that ensures they are able to meet today  s challenges and future requirements     Senator Clinton said            Local funding details include        2 5 million for Benet Labs   Rarefaction Wave Gun      The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes  2 5 million in funding for Benet Labs to continue their work on the Advanced Technology Lightweight Armament System Rarefaction Wave Gun  ATLAS Raven  project   This system supports the goal of developing an ultra lightweight combat vehicle that will significantly enhance the ability of all services to rapidly deploy to trouble spots worldwide   The ATLAS system will provide the enabling technologies for unprecedented reductions  50   in the weight of large caliber high muzzle energy cannons   These weight reductions in the gun system will reduce vehicle weight and allow for air transportability   Benet Labs  located within the Watervliet Arsenal  received  2 5 million in FY 06 funds for this project        12 4 million for the Lightweight 155 mm Towed Howitzer which benefits Watervliet Arsenal      The M777A1 Lightweight 155mm Howitzer cannon is a joint program with the US Marine Corps and US Army to replace the aging 198 towed howitzers   The M777A1 improves upon M198 performance with networked fires at almost 50  of the weight of the M198   Watervliet Arsenal manufactures the cannon assembly for the M777A1 Lightweight 155mm howitzer
