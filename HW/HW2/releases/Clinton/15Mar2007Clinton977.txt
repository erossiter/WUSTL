March 15  2007 Senator Clinton Announces Initiative to Address Growing Crisis Facing Subprime Mortgage Holders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   In an address to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced an initiative to address the growing crisis facing those holding subprime mortgages   Underscoring the need to make the rules clear and level the playing field for homebuyers  Senator Clinton outlined a plan to break down barriers to owning a home and build up protections against unfair and unscrupulous lending practices   Senator Clinton s plan will provide more borrowing options for lower income  minority and first time homebuyers before they sign on the dotted line  more information and safeguards against abuses when signing a mortgage  and smart reforms to reduce foreclosures              In her remarks  Senator Clinton emphasized the urgent need to act    The subprime problems are now creating massive issues on Wall Street   It is a serious problem affecting our housing market and millions of hard working families buying a home  many of them for the first time  We need to expand the role of the Federal Housing Administration to issue more mortgages at better rates to these homeowners  And we need to give consumers more counseling and information  prevent families from being trapped in high interest loans with pre payment penalties  and in some cases allow more breathing room from foreclosure  This market is clearly broken  and if we don t fix it  it could threaten our entire housing market   said Senator Clinton            The market for subprime loans has expanded rapidly  growing from  20 billion in 1993 to over  600 billion today    Subprime now represents 23 percent of all new mortgage loans and 13 percent of all mortgages outstanding   The subprime mortgage market serves mostly people with poor or limited credit histories  and the rates and fees on subprime mortgages are higher than those on traditional mortgages   According to Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD   subprime borrowers are disproportionately African American and Latino            With the real estate market cooling  subprime borrowers are facing significant challenges   The situation is made worse by the fact that the two year  fixed rate  teaser  period on over  300 billion in adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs  will expire this year  saddling most borrowers with higher monthly payments   The Center for Responsible Lending estimates that nearly 20 percent of subprime loans made in 2005 and 2006 will end in foreclosure   Late payments and defaults are rising rapidly  In the fourth quarter of 2006  13 3 percent of all sub prime loans and 14 4 percent of subprime ARMs were delinquent   The subprime market now accounts for more than 60 percent of foreclosures            Senator Hillary Clinton today announced a new initiative to address the growing crisis in the subprime mortgage lending market          Expand Access to Independent Face to Face Counseling   Senator Clinton underscored the need to ensure that financial counseling is available to borrowers before they take out mortgages   In particular  Senator Clinton emphasized the need to expand access to programs and initiatives that assist at risk borrowers    These initiatives  such as the National Community Reinvestment Coalition s  Consumer Rescue Fund  can provide borrowers unbiased advice on lenders  loan types  refinancing options  etc   Studies have shown that pre purchase  face to face counseling lowers delinquency and default rates  Many borrowers fail to appreciate the significant financial responsibilities that come with a mortgage  they fail to manage their finances appropriately to meet those responsibilities  or they simply do not understand the loan terms   Large numbers of unsuspecting people are also  steered  to sub prime mortgages even when they qualify for lower cost ones            Encourage Refinancing When the Loan Floats or Payment Shock Hits   Senator Clinton proposed limiting the length of time for which prepayment penalties apply  and prohibiting prepayment penalties on mortgages with rates above a specified level   She emphasized that 70 percent of sub prime mortgages have prepayment penalties  but less than 5 percent of prime mortgages do  Loans with prepayment penalties have 52 percent greater default risk according to findings by the Center for Responsible Lending and the National Low Income Housing Coalition    Some adjustable rate mortgages  ARMs  have prepayment penalties that extend beyond the fixed rate period  making it difficult for borrowers to avoid incurring the higher floating rate payments             Require  Plain Talk  No Fine Print Disclosure   Senator Clinton underscored that the protections offered by the Truth in Lending Act and existing federal regulations should be strengthened  Mortgage lenders should clearly and explicitly explain the risks and costs of mortgages  In particular  there should be  plain talk  disclosure of payment escalations on ARMs  prepayment penalties  balloon payments  the price premiums on reduced documentation loans  and the cost of taxes and insurance which are not included in the mortgage payments           Promote Foreclosure Timeout   Senator Clinton discussed creating incentives for lenders to identify troubled mortgages and sit down with borrowers and try to figure out a way to restructure the loans before foreclosing   One option would be to give borrowers some period of forbearance in which they could get their financial house in order before resuming their mortgage payments   When a homeowner is having trouble making mortgage payments  some financial institutions sit down with borrowers to try to restructure the loans and figure out ways for borrowers to make their payments   In too many cases  however  homeowners don t reach out to their lenders and simply default after missing their payments  ultimately losing their homes            Strengthen the Federal Housing Administration s Mortgage Insurance Program    Senator Clinton called for passage of legislation she has proposed  the 21 st Century Housing Act  which strengthens the FHA  makes FHA loans available to more Americans  and expands access to a responsible and stable alternative to the subprime market   Senator Clinton s bill also would raise existing FHA mortgage limits in high cost areas like New York and California  making FHA an option for borrowers in those places   In addition  her bill would allow the FHA to reinvest a portion of its revenue in hiring more employees  upgrading its IT systems  and taking other steps to improve its operating infrastructure   These initiatives would position the FHA to work more efficiently with lenders  develop new mortgage products  and serve a larger number of borrowers            Homebuyers who do not qualify for conventional mortgages are the most common users of FHA backed mortgages   This population of first time buyers  many of whom are low  or moderate income  and minority  is essentially the same that turns to the subprime market   FHA insurance makes it possible for private lenders to provide mortgages to lower income families without attaching the rates and fees that sub prime lenders do  FHA s market share  however  has been dropping in recent years  In the 1990s FHA loans were about 12 percent of the market  today  they are closer to three percent  Strengthening the FHA would provide more homebuyers an alternative to the subprime market
