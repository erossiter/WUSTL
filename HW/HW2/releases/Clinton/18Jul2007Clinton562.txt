July 18  2007 Senator Clinton Speaks on the Senate Floor on Higher Education                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton delivered remarks on higher education on the floor of the Senate today as the debate begins about the Higher Education Reconciliation Bill of which Senator Clinton is a co sponsor      A transcript of Senator Clintons remarks is below      I am delighted to come to the floor and talk about this extremely important piece of legislation   And I thank our leader and a great advocate on behalf of education  the Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee  Senator Kennedy      This bill really represents a tremendous victory for students  for their families  for higher education  for the future of the American economy  for millions of families who still struggle to pay for college and for millions of young people who will not only carry forth from their education a degree  but on average  more student debt than any graduates who came before them     Most of all  this bill is a victory for that young boy or girl who is thriving in school  who might one day wish to attend college and fulfill his or her God given potential  but worries that such a wish is beyond his or her reach  that it s just too expensive to realize     I want to commend the members of the committee on both sides of the aisle for the great work that has been done bringing this bill to the floor  I was thrilled with many of the provisions  some of which I ve worked on ever since I came to the Senate  particularly focusing on nontraditional students who more and more are becoming the norm  older students  married students  single parent students  who often have found that there were barriers to their accessing whatever help was available from the federal government programs to continue their education     I m also personally just thrilled at what we ve done for homeless and foster youth   This has been a passion of mine going back to my years as a law student when I first started representing abused and neglected children   children who ended up in the foster care system  all the way through my time in the White House  where we were instrumental in working with the Congress in passing landmark legislation to make adoption easier  to try to make the foster care system more responsive to the needs of the child and to accelerate decisions being made as to whether or not a child would ever realistically be able to return to his or her biological family   to my years in the Senate  where we have continued to try to help students who are in the foster care system as they age out      As Senator Murray pointed out  when you turn 18 or graduate from high school  whichever comes first  still in many states in our country  you are no longer eligible for the foster care system   And what that has meant is that a social worker usually shows up at the foster home with a big black garbage bag and tells the young man or woman to put his or her belongings into that bag because they are no longer able to live in a foster home with state support      For many young people whom I ve been privileged to know  some of whom have interned for me  have worked for me in my office here or in my office in the White House  they were the lucky ones   You know  they had the right combination of personal resilience and ability combined with mentoring and some breaks along the way that enabled them to complete high school and often go to college at great cost   Many of them had nowhere to go during summer vacations or Thanksgiving or Christmas or any other break in the academic schedule   Some of them hid themselves in the dorm   Some of them stayed in bus stations or airports   Some of them prevailed upon a friendly professor or fellow student to take them in   So by recognizing the special needs of these special students  we really do a very important piece of legislative business that has a big heart in it   And I thank my colleagues who worked with me and others to make this happen     When we think about the importance of college  it s hard to really grasp the fact that most young people in our country will not go to college and graduate   The college going rate has been pretty stagnant now for about 20  30 years   And as the cost of higher education has gone up  it s become even more difficult for young people to work their way through to afford the increases in tuition  room  and board   But the investment in college still remains a very good one   Each additional year of education after high school increases an individual s income by 5 to 15 percent   A college degree will enable an individual to earn close to  1 million more in the course of a life s work than those who have only a high school diploma   It is no coincidence that the rise of the American middle class coincided with the explosion of college attendance  It unlocks economic potential and it gives students access to the American dream  to a career and a life that they then can build      But  as I say  unfortunately in the past 25 years  the cost of college has risen faster than inflation   College costs have tripled over the past 20 years  and as the costs spiral upward  so does the size of the loans and the loan payments that are necessary   Students who borrow take out loans averaging  15 500 while attending public colleges and universities and almost  20 000 while attending private schools  twice what they would have borrowed just ten years ago   At New York University in Manhattan  60 percent of students graduate owing an average of  27 639   At Idaho State University  69 percent of students graduate owing an average of  29 467   And at the University of Miami in Florida  whose President served with such distinction in this town as the Secretary of Health and Human Services for eight years  58 percent of the students graduate owing an average of  31 723      Now  this debt limits students  options and damages their financial futures   It really is a chain around their ankles as they end their education and go out into the world of work   With this reconciliation bill  we are cutting that chain   This bill will provide  17 3 billion in student aid  the largest increase in student aid in more than a decade   And it will provide this aid without raising federal taxes one dime      First  the Higher Education Reconciliation Bill increases the purchasing power of the Pell Grant  which helps the lowest income students offset the cost of college   It s no secret to anyone in this chamber the purchasing power of the Pell Grant has declined dramatically from nearly 60 percent of the cost of a public school 20 years ago to only 36 percent today   This legislation provides the largest Pell Grant increase in more then a decade  increasing the maximum Pell Grant to  5 100 immediately and to  5 400 by 2011     Now take my state  for example   This initial boost will provide over  200 million in increased grant aid to New York students for the 2007 2008 school year alone and  1 7 billion by 2013    The legislation also raises the income cut off for Pell Grants from  20 000 to  30 000  making many more students from many more families eligible to receive a Pell Grant     Second  I m very pleased that the Higher Education Reconciliation Act tackles an issue addressed in legislation I sponsored in the last Congress  called the Student Borrowers Bill of Rights   It provides protections for student borrowers while they repay their loans   It does so by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of the borrowers discretionary income and providing several important protections to members of the armed forces and public service employees during repayment   This is critical to helping students manage their debt especially in the first few years after they graduate     Third  I am pleased that the reconciliation bill also creates a new loan forgiveness plan through the direct loan program for public service employees      I hear from many students in New York and around the country who would love to be teachers or police officers or firefighters or nurses or social workers or public defenders  but sadly they are so saddled with debt that such careers in the public arena seem like an impossibility for them  That is the wrong policy   We want to encourage more young people to go into public service   Our policies should respect that choice  not denigrate it     Under the Loan Forgiveness Program the remaining loan balance on a loan is forgiven for a borrower who has been employed in a public sector job and making payments on the loan for 10 years   These jobs are essential to the communities they serve and I believe this program will encourage public service and provide an incentive for borrowers to pursue low paying  perhaps  but vital professions to our country      Mr  President  when I was getting ready to go to college many years ago  my father who was a small businessman    a very small business    said that he had saved enough money for me to go to college and he could pay tuition  room  and board  but if I wanted to buy a book I had to earn the money   And that was fine because I had worked ever since I was 13 in the summer and during vacations  So I worked my way through college with my family s help and when I graduated I decided I wanted to go to law school   I told my father that and he said that is not part of the bargain   If you want to go to law school you have to pay for it yourself   So I got a little scholarship and I continued to work year round and I borrowed money directly from the federal government  the National Defense Education Act  something which many of us in this chamber took advantage of when we were pursuing our education   And the interest rate was very low   The repayment schedule was something I could handle   I didn t have to worry about anyone raising the rate on me or changing the terms on me   I just worked  first  for the Children s Defense Fund as a young lawyer  and then in public service here in Washington  working for the Congress  and then teaching law at the University of Arkansas and running a legal aid clinic   And during all those years when I was doing public service and academic work I could handle what my repayment obligations were     I want that available for young people today   I think it s important  especially as we look at what s happening in government service and other public service professions to see how there is an aging that is going to eventually result in the loss of a lot of very experienced people     I spent Monday at Binghamton University in New York  where we have the only PhD program in rural nursing   And I met with the nursing faculty and some of the nursing students   And it s a wonderful program  but the average age of a nurse in America is over 45   And the average age of a nursing faculty member is 54     And we have many  many people who want to go to nursing school who don t have places for them even though they re qualified and we have a lot of others who worry about how they can pay for their education   And you can replicate that across every single profession that really falls into the service professions  the caring professions that we are seeing shortages of people going into because there s a disconnect between the salary that they are paid and the debt they have to incur in order to get the credential to be able to perform the public service     So I believe in the long run this increase in student aid will pay for itself  Not only do college graduates earn more and therefore are able to pay back to society  but they are less likely to draw on public resources and they re much more likely to really make a contribution     This bill has had great bipartisan support and I m very proud to have worked on it and to see the positive changes that it includes   Clearly  this is something that I hope we will be able to pass by acclamation  Mr  President   I hope that after the difficulties and the debate and the disagreements of the last week over the very difficult issue of Iraq  I hope we come together around a fundamental American value  namely education     We have the best higher education system in the world  it is a system filled with second chances for people who decide at the age of 18 or 80 that they want to pursue an education at a community college or a technical college or a four year college or a university   This is one of the really important aspects of American society and it s instrumental to the further development of our economy and the hope of a return to shared prosperity for our people     Mr  President  I highly urge that all of our colleagues come together to support this Higher Education Reconciliation Bill to make higher education more affordable   It is good social policy   It is good economic policy   It is certainly good budgetary policy  and it makes a big difference to millions and millions of hard working young people and their families
