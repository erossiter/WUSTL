                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Announcement by Six Government Agencies Today Reflects Clinton Bishop Legislation and Cooperation of New York and Connecticut                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Tim Bishop  NY 01  today applauded the announcement by six government agencies that they have reached an accord to manage Long Island Sound Dredged Materials and have agreed on a process to support the goal of reducing or eliminating open water disposal of dredged materials into the Sound while maintaining the economic viability of New York and Connecticut s working ports          The agreement announced today is between the United States Environmental Protection Agency  United States Army Corps of Engineers  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection  New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and New York State Department of State  The agreement formally ratifies the parties  intention to administer a Regional Dredging Team to assist with options for the management of dredged materials while the larger Dredged Material Management Plan is being developed           In March of 2004  the EPA had proposed to designate two sites in the Long Island Sound as disposal sites for dredge material  Responding to environmental concerns about the proposal  Clinton and Bishop introduced legislation to require the development of a Dredge Material Management Plan that would govern disposal in the Sound  As part of that process  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA were to evaluate upland disposal options and dump only the cleanest dredge material as a matter of last resort  The deal announced by these agencies today is an important step in their goal of protecting the Long Island Sound           I am pleased that these federal agencies and the states of New York and Connecticut have come to this agreement to build on the fundamental principles we put forward in our bill  and protect the Long Island Sound  This agreement sets in place the framework necessary to protect this magnificent resource from the dumping of contaminated materials   said Senator Clinton   This is certainly a welcome improvement on the original proposal which was totally unacceptable to everyone who recognizes the value of the Sound  This agreement promises a much better approach to the management of the Sound and we will continue to monitor their progress as they move forward            This agreement recognizes that the Long Island Sound is a valuable natural resource  not an aquatic landfill   Representative Bishop said    We have come a long way from the original plan which would have been environmentally devastating to the health of the Sound   I m pleased that the legislation Senator Clinton and I offered served as the catalyst for this solution   This effort reminds us that when we work together and seek creative answers  we can do things that protect the health and safety of the Long Island Sound            According to the announcement today  the agreement ratifies the intent of three federal and three state agencies to formally administer a Regional Dredging Team to comply with the June 3  2005  rulemaking by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  USEPA  that designated open water dredged material disposal sites in Central Long Island Sound  CLIS  and Western Long Island Sound  WLIS   The establishment of the Regional Dredging Team will assist dredging proponents in considering and evaluating various management options for their dredged material while a larger effort to develop a Dredged Material Management Plan  DMMP  for Long Island Sound is being conducted  The agreement covers dredging projects in both New York State and Connecticut waters           The deal by the six agencies establishes a Long Island Sound Regional Dredging Team that will            Review all federal dredging projects  and those non federal dredging projects proposing more than 25 000 cubic yards of open water disposal at WLIS or CLIS            Evaluate all available information to ensure that a thorough effort has been conducted to identify practicable alternatives            Ensure that beneficial use alternatives are used whenever practical for some or all of the material            Enhance communication and discussion among the participating agencies             Facilitate timely review and presentation of recommendations for the management and beneficial use of dredged material from the Sound  and              Provide advice on dredged material management for other dredging projects located on or in tributaries to the Sound            Senator Clinton and Congressman Bishop have worked tirelessly with the Long Island community to address concerns about the dumping of dredge waste material in the Sound  In addition to the legislation they introduced in 2004  they have lobbied other elected representatives  EPA officials and representatives from the Army Corps of Engineers on this important issue
