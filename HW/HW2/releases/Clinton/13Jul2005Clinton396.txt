July 13  2005 Clinton Introduces Kids Safe Chemicals Act of 2005                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today joined Senators Frank Lautenberg  NJ  and James Jeffords  VT  in introducing the Kid Safe Chemicals Act of 2005 to create a non toxic environment to protect children  s health before and after birth  to protect workers and others   The Act responds to the growing body of scientific literature which is identifying chemical exposures as a factor in the rise of disorders and diseases such as birth defects  asthma  neurological and developmental disorders  infertility and certain types of cancer   Bio monitoring studies are finding hundreds of these synthetic chemicals in our bodies  even in infants and fetuses          We lack the most basic information about the hundreds of chemicals that children are exposed to in the products we use every day     said Senator Clinton     This important legislation would close the gap in our understanding of chemical effects  and would require manufacturers to test their chemicals before they put them on the market         This legislation helps protect kids by requiring manufacturers to provide health and safety information prior to distributing a chemical in consumer products  instead of using kids and others as guinea pigs by presuming a substance is safe until proven dangerous   It also closes the knowledge gap in our understanding of chemical safety risks by prioritizing chemicals to make sure the worst chemicals are examined first          Philip Landrigan  MD  the Professor   Chair of Community   Preventive Medicine and the Department of Pediatrics at the Mt  Sinai School of Medicine said    Evidence is accumulating rapidly that industrial chemicals cause disease in children include learning disabilities  cancer  and lung disease  The best way to prevent diseases of chemical origin is to test chemicals  learn whether or not they are toxic  and then if they are toxic  take appropriate steps to reduce their use  and limit the exposures of pregnant women and children to these chemicals  This bill will be an important step towards getting us there  and I support the efforts of Senator Clinton  Senator Lautenberg  and their colleagues in this area           The Kids Safe Chemicals Act of 2005 would      require manufacturers to provide health and safety information prior to distributing a chemical in consumer products  instead of presuming a substance is safe until proven dangerous     reduce our toxic ignorance by providing much needed hazard and exposure information to EPA and the public      require EPA to determine the safety of 300 chemicals within the next five years  By 2020  all chemicals distributed in commerce would need to meet the safety standard
