May 22  2006 Senator Clinton Reiterates Call for Student Borrower  Bill of Rights                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Uniondale  NY    Today  during her commencement speech to Adelphi University  s 2006 graduating class  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton again reiterated her call for legislation that she will introduce to protect the rights of student borrowers trying to repay their loans  The Senator s Student Borrower Bill of Rights aims to provide student borrowers with basic rights so that there is increased transparency in student borrowing  so that loan payments are affordable  so that students can shop for loans in a free marketplace  and so that students have timely information about their loans  The bill will also increase education for students and parents on their rights as borrowers            Unlike other debt  student loans are loans that you take out to invest in yourself  And for most students  it is a wise investment   But I have heard from too many students across New York that they are overly burdened or treated unfairly as they repay student loans     said Senator Clinton    The Student Borrower  s Bill of Rights will make it easier for students to repay their loans by putting in place a basic set of rights  including the right to borrow without exploitation and the right to real loan choices             Students are borrowing now more than ever to pay for higher education   Need based grant aid has stagnated while college costs have grown  The result is more students borrowing and higher levels of borrowing  In 1993  less than one half of students graduating from four year colleges and universities had student loans   Now two thirds do  Over the past decade  the average debt burden for college graduates has increased 58 percent  after accounting for inflation          When student loans are burdensome  borrowers may be unable to buy a home   They may avoid important but low paying professions  such as public health workers  social workers  and teachers   The burden of student loans also prevents college graduates from pursuing a higher degree   According to studies by the Nellie Mae Corporation  40 percent of college graduates who do not go to graduate school  blame student loan debt   Today 54 percent of former students wish they had borrowed less for college  an increase from 31 percent in 1991   The prospect that student loans will be a great burden may also prevent successful high school students from going to college  20 percent of low income high school graduates qualified for college  do not go to college          Senator Clinton  s legislation is aimed at making it easier for students to repay and at giving them rights that are enforceable  The bill would give them the right to fair  monthly payments that do not exceed a certain percentage of their incomes and fair interest rates and fees  Too many students are seeing their costs go up after they think they  ve already budgeted for what they can pay  The bill would also give them the right to be able to borrow without exploitation  Finally  the bill aims at giving students access to better information about loans and more information that will give them better options
