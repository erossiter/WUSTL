November 15  2005 Statement of Senator Clinton on the Iraq Amendments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    For three years now  I have  along with my Democratic colleagues  questioned the Administration about their specific plans in Iraq   Time after time  we have been given rhetoric when simply asking for the facts   Congress and the public deserve the facts from this Administration about progress in Iraq and what the future holds for both the American and Iraqi people          I joined my colleagues today in supporting the amendments on the Iraq war calling upon the President and his Administration to provide answers and a plan on the war   In September of 2004 I said to Secretary Rumsfeld at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing    When you look at the statements that have been made in the past by you and others in the Administration  it is very difficult to track the predictions and the expectations that were presented to this Committee  to others in Congress  and certainly to the American people  with where we are today              This past September I confronted Secretary Rumsfeld again at an Armed Services Committee hearing    You know  one of the challenges for those of us sitting on this side of the table is that the strategy which you have described    has neither benchmarks nor results that we can see which lead us to believe that it s a strategy that s working          We in Congress have repeatedly asked for answers and have repeatedly been obstructed by the Administration            Last month  many of us sent a letter to President Bush specifically asking him    How many Iraqi forces must be capable of operating without U S  assistance or with minimal U S  support before we can begin reducing our military presence and when will that number be reached      We have yet to receive a response          I have just returned from Israel and Jordan where I saw first hand the true devastation that terrorism can inflict on a nation   We must continue to be strong in our fight against terrorists  but we need an Administration that levels with the American people on true goals and objectives            President Bush noted on Friday that it is legitimate to criticize his conduct of this war   What we need now is for the President to listen to this criticism and provide answers          As I have said in the past  I disagree with the way the President has used the authority granted to him and the way he has prosecuted this war  I am glad that the Senate today acted in a bipartisan manner to demand answers from the President   The time is long overdue for the Administration to give us the facts about their current and future plans for the war in Iraq   Our brave men and women who serve valiantly each and every day deserve nothing less           Click here for more of Senator Clinton s statements concerning the war in Iraq
