February 2  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the President  s Plan to Slash Funding for Children  s Health Insurance  Medicare and Medicaid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC     It is unconscionable that the President  s answer to our health care crisis is to cut the already strained health care safety net for our most vulnerable   The President  s plan to cut funding to states for the Children  s Health Insurance program and slash tens of billions of dollars from Medicare and Medicaid is more evidence of the President  s misplaced priorities   These cuts would take us backward and only magnify our health care challenge   We need to move forward and make health care more affordable and accessible for seniors  families struggling to make ends meet and the millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans   We face a real challenge on health care that we must confront head on   This is exactly the wrong approach   I will work to stop this short sighted scheme and instead put us on the path to making quality  affordable health care accessible to all Americans
