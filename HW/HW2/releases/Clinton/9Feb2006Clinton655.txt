                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Bi partisan Congressional Delegation Calls on Federal Government to Allow State  s Health Insurance Facilitated Enrollment Program to Continue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    In an effort to help the state  s uninsured  a unified New York Congressional Delegation is calling on the Federal Government to allow the State to continue its long running program that helps working families obtain health insurance            Lead by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Peter King  the members of the delegation are calling on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to approve a critical provision in New York State  s pending federal Medicaid waiver that allows for the operation of its   facilitated enrollment    program  which helps working families to access health insurance  The   facilitated enrollment    program helps the State connect with New Yorkers who might be eligible for health insurance  providing a critical point of entry for thousands of individuals and their families into the public health insurance system  However  the program can only continue to operate if the State is granted permission through the pending Medicaid waiver             Thousands of New York  s working families are eligible for public health insurance coverage  yet many don  t know that they can apply and don  t know how to access the system  The facilitated enrollment program reaches families in their schools  churches  and community centers and is critically important in rural parts of the state where access would otherwise be hours and miles away   New York  s facilitated enrollment program is a model for the country on how to get people insured  I hope the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services hear our united  bi partisan call to keep this program going     Senator Clinton said               The continuation of facilitated enrollment is critical to New York s Medicaid  Family Health Plus and Child Health Plus programs  I urge CMS to approve New York State s waiver request     said Congressman Peter King  Seaford            A copy of the delegation letter is attached        Congress of the United States  Washington  DC 20510         February 8  2006         The Honorable Mark McClellan  M D   Ph D   Administrator  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  Mail Stop C5 11024  7500 Security Boulevard  Baltimore  MD 21244 1850         Dear Dr  McClellan           As members of the New York delegation  we urge you to preserve the facilitated enrollment program by approving New York State  s requested exemption to the 1997 Balanced Budget Act enrollment broker provision   This request was submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in November 2005 as part of New York State  s 1115 waiver extension application           The facilitated enrollment program is a critical point of entry for hundreds of thousands of hard working  low income New Yorkers and their families to the public health insurance system   Without this program  invaluable services conducted by health plans and heath care providers will be jeopardized  scores of New Yorkers who have public health insurance will be in danger of losing it  and thousands more who qualify could have significant trouble obtaining it           Facilitated enrollers help New York State determine eligibility for public health insurance by collecting necessary documents  conducting mandated face to face interviews  and calculating income eligibility   They make it possible for children and parents to apply for public health insurance coverage at a single location where they can also seek assistance in renewing their eligibility           Located where the uninsured live and work  facilitated enrollment sites are easy for New York residents to access across the state   They are found in local clinics  schools  churches and community centers and are open on evenings and weekends   This accessibility is particularly important in more rural parts of New York where residents may be many miles from the closest welfare or Medicaid offices to which they would otherwise have to go to apply for public health insurance           By reaching the uninsured in rural and urban areas  the facilitated enrollment program has helped create a more effective health insurance system for working individuals and their families in New York   Statewide  over 50  of Medicaid and Family Health Plus  and 100  of Child Health Plus  applications are completed at facilitated enrollment sites   As a result  the number of uninsured children in New York has dropped from 729 000 to 469 000 in just six years   Today  nearly 1 5 million low income adults in New York are receiving the health care they need to stay healthy and working           In addition  the private sector in New York employs approximately 2 000 facilitated enrollers and many more workers in positions like data management and quality assurance that are necessary to support the work of facilitated enrollers   These are critical jobs in our local communities and across the state           We must preserve New York  s facilitated enrollment program   We appreciate your consideration of our views and urge you to allow New York to continue its facilitated enrollment program            Sincerely yours          Charles
