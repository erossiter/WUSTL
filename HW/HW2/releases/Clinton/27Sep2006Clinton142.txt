September 27  2006 Senators Clinton and Specter Introduce Bill to Establish United States Public Service Academy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Arlen Specter today introduced legislation to establish the first Public Service Academy in the United States   The U S  Public Service Academy Act  The PSA Act  establishes an undergraduate academy designed to cultivate a new generation of young leaders dedicated to public service   Modeled after the military service academies  the PSA Act will create an academy to provide a four year  federally subsidized college education for more than 5 000 students a year in exchange for a five year commitment to public service following graduation              Now  more than ever  it is imperative that our nation improve its capacity to groom future public servants   The establishment of a Public Service Academy is an innovative way to strengthen and protect America by creating a corps of well trained  highly qualified civilian leaders     said Senator Clinton            The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that more than two million teachers will be needed in classrooms across the country in the next decade   At the same time  more than 80 percent of the nation  s 17 000 law enforcement agencies report that they cannot fill needed positions due to a lack of qualified candidates  Graduates of the Public Service Academy will help to fill these vacancies by serving their county for five years after graduation in areas such as civil service  the public sector  and other needed fields   A recent study by the Higher Education Research Institute found that more than two thirds of a college freshman class expressed a desire to serve others  though the increase in college tuition may keep many of these students from choosing a career in public service   The Public Service Academy will afford students such as these the opportunity to go to college and tap into the strong desire to serve that already exists among college students             Prospective applicants to the Academy will follow a nomination process similar to that used for admission to the military academies where each senator and representative nominates candidates for consideration
