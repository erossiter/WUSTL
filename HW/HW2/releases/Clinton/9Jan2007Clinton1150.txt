January 9  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Department of Homeland Security  s Announcement of FY 2007 Infrastructure Protection Program Grants for New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I am pleased that the Department of Homeland Security is recognizing the serious need for funding to secure New York  s ports and transit systems but sadly much more needs to be done to address our vulnerabilities  The memories of the London and Madrid transit bombings  the sentencing of Shahawar Matin Siraj for plotting to bomb the Herald Square subway station in 2004 and the continuing threats of terrorism aimed at our ports  bridges  tunnels and other transportation infrastructure are harsh reminders that the price for under funding transit and transportation security is too great       I am very pleased that Buffalo  s security needs have again been recognized by DHS  and I hope that they will continue to get their fair share of the Tier II Transit Security Grant funds when the final figures are calculated  I am also pleased that DHS  has recognized that Amtrak  our vital national passenger rail system  needs protection       However  more security is needed to protect our critical transportation infrastructure   For several years now  I have urged my colleagues in Congress to pass additional transportation security legislation to ensure that we fully address known vulnerabilities in our transportation network  including improvements to the six Amtrak tunnels in New York City  tunnel infrastructure  increased port screening and inspection  and additional flexibility and resources for our cities throughout New York   I will continue to fight until we fully address our glaring security vulnerabilities
