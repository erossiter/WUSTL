February 16  2006 Senator Clinton Urges EPA Chief to Rethink Federal Cuts to Funding For Long Island Sound                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    At a hearing of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works yesterday  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton urged the head of the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA   Stephen L  Johnson  to reconsider the massive funding cuts in the President  s Budget that will impact the Long Island Sound  The Budget included cuts to funding for the EPA  s Long Island Sound program and the National Estuaries Program and completely eliminated funds for the Long Island Sound Restoration Act          The Long Island Sound is a vital commercial and recreational resource for New York and yet this budget leaves New Yorkers virtually on their own to clean up and maintain this precious but vulnerable asset     Senator Clinton said    I was pleased to be able to make this case to Administrator Johnson  The Administration must hear how devastating these budget cuts will be and I hope that Administrator Johnson understands their potential impact  I will fight to restore these funds in Congress           The President  s budget cuts the EPA  s Long Island Sound program from  1 8 million to less than  470 000  jeopardizing the Agency  s ability to implement the Comprehensive Cleanup and Management Plan  CCMP  that has been developed for the Sound         While the Budget includes  1 7 million for the Corps of Engineers to begin work on a long term management plan for the environmentally sound disposal of material dredged from the harbors around the Long Island Sound  it completely eliminates funding for the Long Island Sound Restoration Act  which Congress funded at nearly  4 million last year   This important Act  which Senator Clinton fought to have reauthorized for five years  provides funding for projects to protect the water quality of the Sound  including nitrogen reduction projects  and upgrades to wastewater treatment plants         In addition  the EPA  s National Estuaries Program is cut by  5 3 million  further threatening the clean up of the Sound and the 27 other nationally important estuaries  including the Peconic Estuary
