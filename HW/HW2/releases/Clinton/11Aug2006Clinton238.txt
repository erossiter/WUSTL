                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Four Point Plan Includes  2 45 Billion for Programs to Help Protect Long Island Beaches  Reduce Ocean Pollution  and Clean Up Long Island Sound                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Babylon  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was joined by Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy  Babylon Supervisor Steve Bellone and the Natural Resources Defense Council today in announcing a four point plan to protect Long Island beaches  reduce ocean pollution  and clean up Long Island Sound           The plan  called   Save Our Shores     was announced at an event organized by Supervisor Bellone  where local children planted beach grass to control erosion at Overlook Beach             Long Island  s beaches are an economic engine for Long Island  and we need to be doing more to protect them and clean up the ocean     said Senator Clinton     My plan to   Save Our Shores    would provide nearly  2 5 billion in funding to help protect the shoreline  reduce pollution in the ocean and Long Island Sound  and combat the spread of harmful invasive species               Senator Clinton s proposal to provide federal funding for support of storm water runoff remediation projects will give a significant boost to our efforts to improve the quality of the water which surrounds our Island     said Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy    With the support of the public  Suffolk has invested heavily in preserving land around our significant waterways  in restoring the once abundant shell fish populations and in addressing the environmental problems caused by storm water runoff   The Senator s proposal will bolster Suffolk s aggressive programs to curb storm water runoff     Levy added            I applaud Senator Clinton for proposing this important legislation     said Babylon Town Supervisor Steve Bellone     Our coastal resources are a critical component of our economy and quality of life and their protection must be a top priority               The U S  set a new record of 20 000 beach closings and advisories due to unsafe bacteria pollution last year  more than 800 in New York alone     said Lisa Speer  Director of the Water and Oceans program at the Natural Resources Defense Council     People are getting sick and families are stuck standing on the shore because local communities haven t been getting the federal support they need to fix overloaded sewage systems or deal with contaminated runoff             The   Save Our Shores    plan has four points          1  Clean Up Coastal Waters   Senator Clinton announced today that she will be introducing the   Clean Coast Act      The bill would create a 5 year   1 5 billion U S  Environmental Protection Agency program to help communities in New York and across the country to attack the most pressing coastal water quality problems  such as combined sewer overflows  polluted storm water  and pollution from   non point    sources such as fertilizer and pesticides from lawns   The funding would be available to states  localities and non profit organizations through a competitive grant program  and could be used for projects to  fix sewer and storm water systems to reduce pollution  restore wetlands that filter water as it flows from land to streams  estuaries and the ocean  and implement watershed protection plans designed to reduce erosion or pollution from non point sources          2  Protect and Restore our Coastline   Senator Clinton is working to provide funding to complete the   Fire Island to Montauk Point Reformulation Study      That study is a partnership between the Corps of Engineers  state and local governments  and environmental groups to develop a comprehensive  long term plan to protect coastal areas along the 83 miles of ocean and bay shorelines from Fire Island Inlet to Montauk Point   The Bush Administration zeroed this study in its budget in 2005  and Senator Clinton fought to restore its funding   This year  she pushed for another  2 5 million for the study   A draft of the plan is due out late this year  and Senator Clinton will push for funding to implement the plan when it is finalized           3  Protect Coastal Ecosystems   Senator Clinton is a cosponsor of the   National Aquatic Invasive Species Act     a bill that addresses the threats posed by harmful  non native aquatic plants and animals  such as the   sea squirt     an animal now invading Long Island Sound  common reeds and other invasive plants that choke many Long Island streams and wetlands  The bill would put several important programs in place  including  a program to require commercial ships to treat ballast water to eliminate invasive species  a program to ban the import of harmful aquatic species in trade  funding to support state programs to control invasive species  the creation of   rapid response    teams to eradicate invasive species that are newly established  and new research initiatives to better understand the pathways through which invasive species come to the United States   The bill would provide  800 million in funding over five years for these programs             4  Guard the Sound  Senator Clinton is a cosponsor of the   Long Island Sound Stewardship Act     which would provide  150 million over 8 years to protect environmentally important land areas around Long Island Sound   Senator Clinton also blocked an EPA plan to permit contaminated dredge spoil dumping in the Sound  and is opposing the Broadwater LNG terminal
