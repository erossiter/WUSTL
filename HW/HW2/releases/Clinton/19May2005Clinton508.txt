May 19  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on House Measure to Block Lockheed Marine One Contract                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                This is just another backdoor effort to try to undo the Marine One contract that was awarded fairly and squarely to the Greater Binghamton area  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and as a conferee with a voice in this process  I will continue to fight for the US101 and to remove this provision  I have called Senators John Warner and Carl Levin  the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee  to tell them that this provision is unjustified and should not be included in the final version of the bill that emerges from conference  The Navy has already concluded that the Lockheed Martin design is superior and the best choice to provide the President of the United States with a state of the art helicopter  The Navy made its decision and we should abide by it and move forward
