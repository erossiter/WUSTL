August 14  2007 Schumer  Clinton Introduce Bill to Protect State s Right to Oppose NYRI s Current Power Line Route                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Legislation Would Restrict NYRI s Ability to Skirt State Siting Process and Restrict Eminent Domain Powers       Schumer  Clinton  Legislation would Block Private Companies from Establishing Power Lines Wherever They Want  However They Want                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Today  U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hilary Rodham Clinton announced that they introduced legislation in the Senate to rein in the ability of the private power company New York Regional Interconnect  NYRI  to opt out of the more thorough and appropriate New York State Public Service  PSC  approval process in an attempt to gain approval at the federal level for its highly controversial proposed power line route  The legislation is designed to curtail the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  to unilaterally establish power line routes through New York State  while stripping FERC of its eminent domain powers and blocking it from overriding New York State s siting process     The Senators today emphasized that NYRIs proposed route is inappropriate by design  cutting through scenic areas and vibrant communities  but that their legislation will would not infringe on more appropriate projects    Its crystal clear that the current legal arrangement is inherently flawed  leaving the state on the sidelines when it comes to determining where NYRI s proposed route will run and how it will affect local communities  said Senator Schumer  This legislation is designed to scale back federal laws that supersede New York State s right to influence proposed line routes in its own backyard  and it strips private companies of their right to build power lines along any path and through any community and pristine park  wherever they want and however they want     This bill will ensure that NYRI cannot make an end run around the states rigorous review and siting process   The project has the potential to impact so many New York communities along the proposed route  and their serious concerns should not be ignored or overridden  Senator Clinton said    In the Energy Policy Act of 2005  Congress authorized the Department of Energy to designate National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors  NIETC  in congested areas of the high voltage power grid  including one corridor that stretches along the East Coast and includes a large chunk of New York State  Congress  in turn  granted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  new authority to permit construction of transmission lines in the designated NIET corridors to companies like NYRI     FERC was given the authority to issue construction permits in cases where a state permitting authority  like the PSC  either fails to act or is unable to act on an application for siting authority  However  the EP Act included a provision that allowed FERC to grant a permit when a state has withheld approval of transmission facilities  FERC determined that withheld approval applies both to a state s denial of permits and a state s failure to act on permits  Thus  a denial is treated the same as inaction  and the denied project can be presented to FERC for approval after one year     Another problematic provision gave power line permit holders  like NYRI  the right to petition in U S  district court to acquire rights of way for the construction of transmission lines through the power of eminent domain  Under current law  a project such as NYRI would be allowed to use the new federal right of eminent domain to condemn private property along its route between Utica and Orange County    It was in the aftermath of the Energy Policy Act  which Senator Schumer opposed  that NYRI  a private power company  proposed the construction of an approximately 200 mile high voltage direct current  HVDC  electric transmission line from Oneida County to Orange County  The proposed route runs through federally protected parks and scores of local communities  Critics argue it will create enormous 150 foot tall  75 foot wide high voltage lines  ruining historic landscapes and trampling on private property rights    To reverse the unfettered power given to FERC that supersedes the state s ability to influence proposed power routes in their own backyard  Schumer and Clinton today announced that they introduced legislation that would accomplish the following
