

today called for new investments and strategies to restore the promise and prosperity of Main Streets and rural communities   Underscoring that the misplaced priorities of the White House and Republican leadership in Congress have left rural areas and small towns to fend for themselves  Senator Clinton called for a targeted and coordinated approach to rural development to help farmers and businesses in these regions build more economic opportunity   To help link rural communities to the resources they need to create jobs  provide opportunities for young people in their communities  and spur investment in their hometowns  Senator Clinton announced a new rural broadband initiative and outlined initiatives to increase access to capital  spur regional public private partnerships  invest in renewable energy  improve health care and education for rural communities  and strengthen the safety net for family farmers            We can make the American Dream real again in rural communities and small towns   We can create a rural renaissance and restore the promise of Main Street and make our whole country stronger in the process     Senator Clinton said     By investing in renewable energy we can re imagine and reinvigorate agriculture in America  by investing in broadband technology and opening up access to capital  we can foster innovation and growth  and by strengthening our agricultural sector  improving our health care system  and expanding opportunities in education we can preserve quality of life and keep good jobs in rural and small town communities          Bringing the Promise of Broadband to Rural Communities      Senator Clinton underscored that we need a national broadband strategy that focuses on delivering broadband access to our rural areas   She announced a new Rural Broadband Initiative to renew the focus on the 25 percent of our nation  s population who live outside of urban areas who are being increasingly left out of the new   Information Age    economy   Senator Clinton will introduce legislation to coordinate and maximize federal resources by establishing a single office run by an administrator that will assume the duties and responsibilities of the disparate federal programs  promote accountability for the performance of these programs  create a   one stop shopping    clearinghouse for innovators and businesses that want to expand broadband in rural areas  connect stakeholders in the public and private sector  and promote new technologies   In addition  Senator Clinton  s bill will create a Rural Broadband Advisory Panel comprising private and public sector leaders committed to seeking meaningful solutions to rural broadband needs   The bill will also create a National Rural Broadband Innovation Fund to invest in cutting edge and experimental rural broadband projects and applications   Finally  the bill will add  25 million to the National Science Foundation budget and provide a clear mandate to research new broadband delivery technologies for rural and other remote areas         Expanding Investment in Rural Communities      Senator Clinton also called for a Rural Regional Investment Program  which would provide equity investments to fund innovative opportunities and partnerships in rural areas   This expands on the rural strategic investment program authorized in the 2002 Farm Bill but never funded   The Rural Regional Investment Program would establish a National Board on Rural America to award planning grants and innovation grants to certified Regional Investment Boards   The primary goal of this program would be to provide rural communities with flexible resources to develop comprehensive  collaborative  locally controlled planning and to foster innovative community and economic development strategies   Examples of successful federally funded regional models have focused on specific geographic targets including the Appalachian Region  the Lower Mississippi Delta Region  and the Northern Great Plains Region         Expanding Availability of Capital      Emphasizing that rural communities are at a disadvantage when it comes to access to capital  Senator Clinton called for simplifying federal programs that provide smaller grants and loans to rural and small town small businesses   She called for pooling private capital and administering that capital through trusted intermediaries who can also provide technical and business advice like Rural Opportunities  Inc  and credit unions  as well as expanding access to microloans   Senator Clinton also emphasized that we need a new capital strategy at the federal level to rework existing rural grant and loan programs to target new opportunities and make these programs simpler to use   She urged considering expanding the New Markets Tax Credit    which has proven successful in urban areas    and making it simpler to use in rural areas   She also underscored the need to provide financial incentives that will attract our young people to return and live  work and raise their families in our rural communities  including school loan forgiveness  rural tax credits for home purchases and business start ups and government backed rural savings and investment accounts         Harnessing the Potential of Renewable Energy      Senator Clinton also emphasized the incredible opportunity for rural America in renewable energy  With gas prices continuing to skyrocket  Senator Clinton has outlined an energy strategy to create a Strategic Energy Fund and cut our dependence on foreign oil in half by 2025   A big piece of this agenda is support for rapid development of renewable energy  including biofuels  Senator Clinton called for expanding geographically the production of ethanol and expanding the kinds of crops we use to make ethanol  and has proposed supporting the development of cellulosic ethanol by providing  1 billion in research funding  as well as loan guarantees for the first billion gallons of production capacity  Senator Clinton noted that biofuel development is underway in New York  where a deal was recently announced to convert an old brewery in Fulton into the largest ethanol refinery east of the Ohio River        Standing With Family Farmers      Senator Clinton underscored that we need a more reliable safety net to help manage risk  including the Milk Income Loss Program and other counter cyclical programs that ensure farmers get a fair price for their product and can earn a decent living  crop insurance programs that provide better coverage and more flexibility and take into account the needs of specialty crop and organic producers  access to disaster assistance  and funding for initiatives like the Emergency Conservation Program and the Emergency Watershed Program  which will help farmers and communities rebuild infrastructure after a disaster  such as the flooding from Hurricane Katrina and the floods that struck New York last month   Senator Clinton emphasized the need to fully fund and strengthen current conservation programs on working lands and to explore new ways to encourage conservation  such as a   green payment    program that would be voluntary  available to all agricultural producers and would provide payments based on environmental performance          Senator Clinton also emphasized that farmers need new markets and innovative ways to market their products    a better distribution infrastructure to reach the marketplace and greater connections to that marketplace    including strengthening   Regional Food Systems    and building on the success of the Farm to Fork initiative that Senator Clinton launched to link New York farmers  restaurants  schools  colleges and others in New York State   In addition  Senator Clinton underscored the need to support and expand programs that provide producers with more value added opportunities  especially as the demand for healthy foods continues to rise  and to work together so that farmers can take advantage of these opportunities          Senator Clinton additionally stressed the need to pass the provisions of the Agricultural Job Opportunities  Benefits  and Security Act  AgJOBS    AgJOBS would bring much needed stability to the farm workforce by encouraging undocumented workers to come forward and work in agriculture in return for the opportunity to earn temporary and then permanent immigration status   By reforming the H 2A guestworker program  AgJOBS would provide a long term solution to a longstanding problem          In addition  Senator Clinton emphasized that she will be introducing legislation to require the International Trade Commission to report to Congress on the actual effects of every trade agreement we sign  after two years  five years and then every five years after it goes into effect  to allow us to make choices based on fact  not ideology or economic theory         Addressing Challenges to Rural Health Care and Education    Rural communities often face the added strain of lack of access to health care  doctors and nurses   Senator Clinton emphasized the power of technology to make sure every rural American has access to quality  affordable health care and help level the playing field through telemedicine and partnerships that connect doctors across the state and nation   Senator Clinton has authored bipartisan health IT legislation that has passed the Senate and will be working to get a final version out of a House Senate Conference Committee            Senator Clinton also announced that she will introduce a rural workforce bill to recruit and keep more health care professionals in rural and small town communities  including steps such as loan forgiveness and tuition assistance so that health care professionals wishing to serve in rural communities do not have to leave for better paying jobs elsewhere   She also underscored the need to expand pipeline programs that expose students living in rural areas to the health professions           Senator Clinton also emphasized the challenge facing rural schools and the benefits of broadband Internet access to connect teachers  administrators and schools to each other through distance learning and collaboration   She also noted the promise of distance learning for health professionals to further their education and training   She also emphasized the need to do more to help students in rural communities afford college  especially non traditional students  who are often older or working or raising a family while attending classes  and to help connect students with employers
