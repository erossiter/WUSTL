                                                                                                                                                                                                                        New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Bishop today called for a meeting with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff in light of the Department  s announcement yesterday that it would be undertaking a   requirements analysis    to identify a next generation biological and agricultural defense facility to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center        In a letter sent to Secretary Chertoff  Senator Clinton and Congressman Bishop emphasized the importance of keeping the internationally renowned Animal Disease Center on Plum Island and the possibility of building a new bio  and agro defense facility on the Island    They also expressed their extreme disappointment with the Department  s reneging on its promise to consult with New York  s representatives on the future of Plum Island         A copy of the letter is attached        August 24  2005       The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  United States Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C   20528         Dear Mr  Secretary         We are writing in response  and in distress  to a fact sheet recently released by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  entitled   National Bio and Agro Defense Facility   which announces a requirements analysis process to identify a next generation biological and agricultural defense facility to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center facility in New York          As your predecessor  Secretary Ridge  and DHS officials with oversight responsibilities for Plum Island know very well  we as elected representatives of this part of New York have invested considerable energy into working with the federal government to ensure the integrity of the work done at this important research facility and the safety of its workforce and the surrounding community  In communications with DHS  including through a meeting with Secretary Ridge himself  we have been promised full communication about the issues and developments that affect Plum Island and our common interests  Therefore  it is most disappointing to learn of your agency  s plans for a facility of this significance by receiving a   fact sheet            We want to be sure that you are directly aware of how vital and critical the research conducted by the Plum Island Animal Disease Center is to keeping this nation s food supply healthy  The researchers are the premier foreign animal disease specialists in the country and we are proud of the work they do  The fact sheet that your department released to us today expresses concern over the facility s adequacy as we move forward into the 21st century  Indeed  the facility is aging and with the new threats to our nation s food supply  we agree whole heartedly that either the promised infrastructure improvements must be made or a new facility must be built  In fact  we have been making this point to the Department of Agriculture and Homeland Security when your department took over the management of the facility   But we strongly question the idea of re locating this facility from Plum Island  and question the underlying assumptions that have led your officials to believe this would make fiscal or policy sense          Plum Island was first established as a foreign animal disease center because of its isolation  with no other communities or buildings occupying the Island  In addition  the very limited livestock population on the surrounding mainland would limit the extent or possibility of an accidental outbreak of a very contagious and economically devastating disease like Foot and Mouth disease  With that in mind  Congress passed a law that mandated that active foot and mouth disease could only be researched and stored on an Island and the Plum Animal Research Center was established  We remind you and the department that active foot and mouth disease has not been worked with on the mainland since that time    the result of such action has been eradication of the disease in the United States          We respectfully request a meeting with you as soon as Congress returns in September to discuss this matter further  Again  we appreciated the chance to work with Secretary Ridge and other agency officials on the important issues related to the Plum Island facility and look forward to a continuation of the discussion with you         Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton      United States Senate             Tim Bishop  United States House of Representatives        cc  Secretary Mike Johanns  Department of Agriculture
