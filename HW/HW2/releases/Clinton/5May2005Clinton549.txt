May 5  2005 Senator Clinton Protests Bush Administration Decision To Allow Old Growth Logging In Roadless Areas Of National Forests                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today protested the Bush Administration s decision to repeal laws that protect the most pristine areas of our National Forests from road building and logging          The Bush Administration s decision to gut the roadless rule is a gift to special interests and a blow to the environment   The revised rule immediately eliminates protection for 34 million acres of the most pristine areas in our National Forests  and opens the door for development of the remaining roadless areas in the coming years   This decision flies in the face of overwhelming public support for protection of roadless areas  Since 2001  over 4 million comments have been submitted  including more than 100 000 from New York  and 97  of those comments opposed weakening protections for roadless areas   Senator Clinton said          The Bush Administration announced substantial changes today to the  roadless  rule for National Forests  The law  which protected more than 60 million acres of National Forests from road building and logging  was introduced under the Clinton Administration  The Bush Administration  s revisions to the rule will immediately open 59  of roadless areas to logging and would allow the remaining 41  to be opened to logging as their forest management plans are revised  While the revised rule establishes a process whereby Governors could petition to protect roadless areas in their states  the Administration does not have to honor those petitions         While the plan would not affect New York s only National Forest in the Finger Lakes  Senator Clinton stressed that the Administration s plan will allow logging in old growth forests and other ecologically important areas in our National Forests
