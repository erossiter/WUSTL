February 8  2005 Senator Clinton Protests Planned Elimination of Vital Funds for Law Enforcement and First Responders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             President s Budget a Devastating Blow to Highly Successful Funding Programs for First Responders Across the Nation   New York State could lose millions of dollars in funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today said she was extremely disappointed by the President s decision to effectively eliminate several important law enforcement funding programs in his Fiscal Year 2006 Budget         Under the President s budget  funding for the COPS program is reduced from  379 million to  118 million nationally  which comes on top of previous years  cuts for the COPS program  which once received more than  1 5 billion in funding  Under the President s proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2006  absolutely no funding is proposed for the COPS Universal Hiring Program  the COPS MORE program  COPS in Schools program  or the COPS Interoperable Communications Technology Program         The budget would also propose no funding for the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program  named after a New York City police officer killed in the line of duty  and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program  These programs in the past have provided states and local governments with federal funds to support efforts to reduce crime and increase public safety  such as enhancing security measures around schools  establishing or supporting drug courts  and preventing violent and or drug related crime  In Fiscal Year 2004  for example  New York State was allocated almost  28 million under the Byrne Formula Grant program alone  That same year  a number of communities across New York State were eligible to receive collectively millions of dollars in Local Law Enforcement Block Grant and COPS funding  At the national level last year  the Byrne formula grant program and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program were combined into one and Congress appropriated  634 million in Fiscal Year 2005 for the combined program  as well as  170 million in funding for Byrne discretionary grants  for a total of more  800 million  All of this funding has been eliminated in the President s proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year          The President s proposed budget is an incredible blow to first responders across New York and the nation  As we guard against the threat of terrorism  we need to do everything within our power to bolster our homeland defense  Slashing funding for the COPS and other programs    which are proven  effective tools for fighting crime and keeping our streets safe    is a slap in the face of our first responders  right when they are being called on to do even more for our nation   Senator Clinton said   We must ensure that we don t rob Peter to pay Paul    we need to support our first responders in every way we can           Just last week during the State of the Union  President Bush said that we owe our law enforcement officers and other first responders our gratitude  I could not agree more  but actions speak louder than words  The President s budget does not provide the critical support that our law enforcement officers so desperately need           The COPS  Universal Hiring Program  UHP  provides funding directly to local  state  and tribal jurisdictions for the salaries and benefits of newly hired officers engaged in community policing  The COPS  Making Officer Redeployment Effective  MORE  program expands the amount of time current law enforcement officers can spend on community policing by funding technology  equipment  and support staff  including civilian personnel  The COPS in Schools  CIS  grant program is designed to help law enforcement agencies hire new  additional school resource officers  SROs  to engage in community policing in and around primary and secondary schools  CIS provides an incentive for law enforcement agencies to build collaborative partnerships with the school community and to use community policing efforts to combat school violence        The COPS  Interoperable Communications Technology Program provides funding to help communities develop effective interoperable communications systems for public safety and emergency services providers  Interoperable Communications Technology grants fund projects that explore uses of equipment and technologies to increase interoperability among the law enforcement  fire service  and emergency medical service communities  These projects are the result of thorough planning and demonstrate how new technologies and operating methods can help communities achieve interoperability        The Local Law Enforcement Block Grants  LLEBG  Program provides funds to units of local government to underwrite projects that reduce crime and improve public safety  The LLEBG Program emphasizes local decision making and encourages communities to craft their own responses to local crime and drug problems        The Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law Enforcement Assistance Grant Program  Byrne Formula Grant Program  is a partnership among federal  state  and local governments to create safer communities  Grants may be used to provide personnel  equipment  training  technical assistance  and information systems for more widespread apprehension  prosecution  adjudication  detention  and rehabilitation of offenders who violate various state and local laws
