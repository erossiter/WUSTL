May 18  2007 Clinton Reintroduces Legislation to Restore FEMA to Independent  Cabinet Level Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she has reintroduced her legislation to restore the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to an independent  Cabinet level federal agency  to ensure that it has the authority it needs to effectively manage recovery efforts for future crises  Under Senator Clinton s legislation  the Director of FEMA would report directly to the President and would have full authority to coordinate with all agencies  as well as the authority to take the necessary action to ensure needed resources and recovery personnel are deployed to those impacted areas           While it has almost been two years  the pain of Hurricane Katrina and FEMA s inadequate response is still fresh in so many people s hearts and minds  On top of that  it seems like every week we hear about new failures on the part of FEMA and the Administration when it comes to disaster response   Senator Clinton said    The head of FEMA must report directly to the President of the United States to establish the communication that is essential to ensuring that the highest levels of our government are coordinating and working effectively in the event of a disaster or emergency           As part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002  President Bush moved FEMA from an independent  Cabinet level rank to a sub agency of the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  under the authority of the Secretary of Homeland Security          Recently  the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security found that FEMA awarded  3 6 billion worth of Katrina contracts for the maintenance of trailers for hurricane victims to companies with no ties to the Gulf Coast region and bad paperwork  In its response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  FEMA has wasted  1 billion in improper payments  spent close to a  1 billion for trailers that could not be used in flood zones and paid  1 8 billion for hotel rooms and cruise ship cabins that were more expensive than apartments  It was also reported recently that over  40 million worth of stockpiled food for the 2006 hurricane season spoiled due to FEMA s lack of preparation   FEMA also recently disclosed that it will not have a new national response plan ready in time for the start of this year s hurricane season          Senator Clinton s legislation will restore FEMA to Cabinet level rank and establish it once again as an independent agency  The FEMA Director would report directly to the President and would have full authority to coordinate with all agencies and take whatever executive action is necessary to ensure needed resources and recovery personnel are deployed to impacted areas in an efficient and timely manner           A recent poll of nearly 6 000 Americans found that 71 percent believed FEMA should be restored to the status of an independent agency  Respondents also believed  by a ratio of more than 4 to 1  that putting FEMA in the Department of Homeland Security had damaged the government s ability to respond to disasters            Americans recognize that housing FEMA under the umbrella of DHS is the wrong way to go   The Department of Homeland Security is a long way away from meeting its intended mission and when it comes to disaster response  we simply cannot wait  When the next disaster or catastrophe happens  we can t afford to say that we ll be ready next time   Senator Clinton said   The bureaucracy created by moving FEMA under the Department of Homeland Security is clearly not working and we must ensure that FEMA has the ability and the authority to respond to whatever may come           When the Department of Homeland Security was created in the Homeland Security Act of 2002  Senator Clinton expressed her deep concerns about moving FEMA under the Department of Homeland Security  because when it operated as an Independent agency   especially on September 11th and in the response thereafter   it was a highly functioning  and well run agency  She stressed that moving FEMA under the Department of Homeland Security must not force a highly functioning and competent agency into a bureaucracy that will challenge integration and diminish FEMA s effectiveness in responding to crises of all kinds
