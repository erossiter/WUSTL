June 8  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Estate Tax Vote                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC      Today the Senate has rightly rejected another shortsighted attempt to repeal the estate tax   It is my hope that today  s vote sends a clear message that another tax cut for the wealthiest Americans at a cost of  1 trillion is exactly the wrong priority for this nation           Indeed  we are still in a time of record deficits  sacrifices are being made by our troops in harms way in Iraq and Afghanistan and many areas of the Gulf Coast remain unlivable with its residents dispersed throughout the country   We have raised the debt limit to  9 trillion  Foreign countries now finance more than half of our government  s public debt  and we now spend more money each year simply paying the interest on that debt than we do on education  homeland security and veterans   health care combined   We would have had to borrow even more from the foreign governments of China  Japan  Saudi Arabia and others that currently hold the note on half of our public debt to help finance this tax cut   But ultimately  the burden of paying for these tax cuts would have fallen on the middle class   The same middle class that has seen their wages squeezed  their job security  health care and pension benefits eroded  the costs of educating their children skyrocket and their ability to receive quality health care compromised by astronomical costs would have been called upon to shoulder the burden of an even more crushing national debt            To be clear  with the repeal of the estate tax  we would not be adding  1 trillion to the deficit to finance our military in Iraq and Afghanistan  to protect our borders  to make sure we  re ready for a flu pandemic  to implement long term energy independence  to make sure that our threatened cities are safe from terrorism or natural disasters  to fix our crumbling public infrastructure or to enact a long term fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax  Repeal of the inheritance tax would have set aside  1 trillion so that the small fraction of millionaires and billionaires in this country would pay nothing when they transfer their huge estates to their heirs   While there is a willingness to support reasonable estate tax proposals that would ensure that virtually no small business owner or farmer would ever face a penny of estate tax liability at a fraction of the cost of full repeal  the Republican leadership chose to proceed with a shortsighted and fiscally irresponsible plan   I am encouraged that sensibility prevailed and this unacceptable measure was defeated today
