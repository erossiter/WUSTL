October 19  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Final Decision in VA Cares Process for Montrose and Castle Point Hospitals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I have had the honor of standing shoulder to shoulder with our veterans at Montrose to fight against the closings and cuts proposed under the CARES process  Although we have made it clear time and again that the Hospital should retain its original services to ensure our Hudson Valley veterans receive the highest level of care available  todays decision by the VA is a mixed one  While I am pleased that Acting Secretary Mansfield elected not to move existing residential treatment programs away from Montrose  I remain strongly opposed to the ill considered decision made in May 2004 to transfer all inpatient psychiatric and nursing home services from Montrose to Castle Point   The decision to move inpatient psychiatric and nursing home services away from Montrose was unfortunately made without the support of adequate strategic plans for mental health and long term care  and without sufficient dialogue with the local veterans who will be most directly affected by such a change      It is my understanding that a number of interesting proposals for future re use of land at Montrose and Castle Point have been brought forward  including some that would provide direct benefits to local veterans  Any decisions made by the VA regarding the re use of land under the Enhanced Use Lease program at either campus must fully account for the needs  views and concerns of local veterans  We can not have a return to the unilateral decision making that cost Montrose their psychiatric and nursing home services in 2004     With U S  troops serving bravely in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world  now is the time to reaffirm the promise we have made as a nation with our veterans by continuing to work to ensure that they have access to quality healthcare here in New York and throughout the country     Senator Clinton has long been a vocal critic of the CARES initiative and has spoken out against the proposed changes to the Montrose facility on a number of occasions  consistently underscoring the importance of a transparent decision making process that emphasizes and fully accounts for the views of the local veterans who rely on the services  Earlier this year  Senator Clinton urged the VA to reconsider moving vital services out of Montrose  She also joined her congressional colleagues in calling on former VA Secretary Nicholson to keep comprehensive medical services at the Montrose VA Campus and to consider local proposals for the site
