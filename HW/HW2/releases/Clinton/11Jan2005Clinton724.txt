January 11  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on the White House to Increase  Funding for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         New York  NY    Today at St  Bart s food pantry in Manhattan  Senator Clinton called on President Bush to increase funding for the Emergency Food and Shelter Program  EFSH  administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  New York City s annual share of the Federal Emergency Management Agency s food and shelter program was cut by  143 000 to  5 5 million this year    a loss of funds critical to New York s many food services programs  Last year  New York City received  5 6 million  Senator Clinton sent President Bush a letter outlining her concerns about lack of funding for the program and urged him to request  175 million in his 2006 budget proposal          At a time when the number of New Yorkers who are hungry is rising  it seems downright cruel to cut funding for food pantries   said Senator Clinton        Senator Clinton commended those who give generously  but believes that private charities and philanthropic individuals cannot and should not be expected to replace government assistance for the neediest New Yorkers  A few years ago  for the first time  the number of Americans utilizing private pantries and kitchens surpassed the number of Americans utilizing government food stamps  And in 2003  the U S  government spent  731 million less on the Food Stamp Program than it did in 1997  This wholesale replacement of public benefits with private food rations have clearly harmed families struggling with hunger          There was a great deal of talk about morals and values in the last election  but what is a better test of our society than how we care for those who are truly in need    Senator Clinton added        According to the New York City Coalition Against Hunger s 2004 annual survey  the number of people fed by the city s kitchens and pantries rose by an estimated 9  in the last year    on top of a 48  increase from 2000 to 2003  In 2003  according to the US Department of Agriculture  the number of Americans facing food insecurity jumped from 25 5 million to 26 6 million   already a level far higher that any other developed country          Those going hungry today are often working  They have families and they blend in with society   said Senator Clinton   But just because their problems are not immediately obvious doesn t mean they aren t in desperate need          The EFSH program has received  153 million each year for the past three years  In both 2001 and 2002  the program received  140 million         Please see attached letter sent to President Bush        January 11  2005       The Honorable George W  Bush  President of the United States  Washington  DC 20500       Dear President Bush        I write to urge you to request  175 million for the Emergency Food and Shelter program in your 2006 budget  This program  which is administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency  has been level funded at  153 million for the last three years    an amount that does not even begin to keep pace with the need        This morning I visited St  Bart s in New York City  a food pantry that serves more than 30 000 low income New Yorkers hot meals each year  Many of the people who rely on St  Bart s have homes  They are working but earning such low salaries that they are unable to meet their basic needs         At St  Bart s the demand for food continues to skyrocket  but the program s resources have not been able to keep up  In 2004 alone  demand for its services rose from 400 clients per month in January to more than 600 per month in August         This situation is mirrored throughout New York City  New York State  and  indeed  the entire United States  According to the New York City Coalition Against Hunger s 2004 annual survey  the number of people fed by the city s kitchens and pantries rose by an estimated 9  in the last year    on top of a 48  increase from 2000 to 2003  That is why I have urged all New Yorkers to donate more time  more food  and more money to feeding groups like throughout the city and throughout the state         But private charities alone cannot provide enough assistance to ameliorate hunger in America  A few years ago  for the first time ever  the number of Americans utilizing private pantries and kitchens surpassed the number of Americans utilizing government food stamps  And in 2003  the U S  government spent  731 million less on the Food Stamp Program than it did in 1997  At the same time  according to the US Department of Agriculture  the number of Americans facing food insecurity jumped from 25 5 million to 26 6 million    already a level far higher that any other developed country         Private  charitable and not for profit organizations are doing their best to fill the void left by the public sector  but they are simply not equipped or well resourced enough to meet the vast need  That is why the Emergency Food and Shelter Program  EFSP  is so critical         An increase of  22 million would be invaluable for vulnerable families  I hope you will take this request to heart and request  175 million for the EFSH in your 2006 budget  Please contact me if you have any questions  Thank you in advance for your careful consideration of this issue        Sincerely        Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton
