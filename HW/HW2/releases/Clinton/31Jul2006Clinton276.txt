July 31  2006 Statement of Senator Clinton on the Letter to President Bush on Iraq by Democratic Senate and House Leaders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Today  s letter to President Bush on Iraq by Democratic leaders on committees with oversight of military  intelligence and international affairs clearly lays out the failures in the Bush Administration  s policy towards Iraq   As the letter states  and as I endorsed in the Levin Reed amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill  I support a phased redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq that should begin before the end of 2006  and U S  forces in Iraq should transition to a more limited mission focused on counterterrorism  training and logistical support of Iraqi security forces  and force protection of U S  personnel   I strongly encourage President Bush to change course in Iraq and take into account the recommendations from these Democratic leaders        Click here for more of Senator Clinton s statements concerning the war in Iraq
