April 26  2007 Senator Clinton Calls for Closure of Guantanamo Bay Detention Center                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called for the closure of thedetention center at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba   Senator Clinton s call came while questioning an Administration official and outside experts at today s hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee to examine legal issues regarding individuals detained by the Department of Defense as enemy combatants   Senator Clinton emphasized that according to reports  both the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State have urged the President to close Guantanamo on the grounds that it is harming the war on terror and undermining the credibility of the trials of the detainees   Senator Clinton underscored the need for the administration to own up to the problem that is Guantanamo             Guantanamo has become associated in the eyes of the world with a discredited administration policy of abuse  secrecy  and contempt for the rule of law   Rather than keeping us more secure  keeping Guantanamo open is harming our national interests   It compromises our long term military and strategic interests  and it impairs our standing overseas   I have certainly concluded that we should address any security issues on what to do with the remaining detainees  and then close it once and for all   said Senator Clinton             The following is a transcript of Senator Clinton s questioning at today s Senate Armed Services Hearing      Senator Clinton    Thank you very much Chairman Levin for holding this important hearing   And perhaps the exchange about the testimony might send a message to the Administration and the Justice Department  who I think  would be surprised to hear a defender of their policies  defend them for things that they frankly have not participated in   They have been quick to disregard precedent and rule of law   They have dismissed the Geneva Convention  so I think that it perhaps would behoove them to get some advice from Mr  Rivkin            It seems to me that any effort to resolve the legal status of the detainees at Guantanamo must  at this stage  include a discussion of the logic of continuing to keep the facility open   Reports emerged in recent months that one of the first things Defense Secretary Gates did upon taking his post was to urge the Administration to close the detention facility at Guantanamo and to move the detainees to the United States   Earlier this month  Secretary Gates confirmed in testimony to the House Armed Services Committee that he had pressed for the closing of Guantanamo and that  in his view  proceedings at Guantanamo would lack credibility internationally           Reports also suggest that Secretary Gates was joined by Secretary of State Rice in calling for Guantanamo to close earlier this year   They reportedly argued that the detention center should be moved to make the trials of detainees more credible  and because Guantanamo s continued existence hampered the broader war effort   It is my further understanding that this proposal was reportedly blocked by Attorney General Gonzales and Vice President Cheney for two reasons   First  because they were concerned it would make it harder for them to argue that the detainees have no rights  and second  that it would be a public admission that Guantanamo was a mistake   So here you have a facility that according to reports  the Secretaries of Defense and State argue is harming the war on terror            State Department and Pentagon officials have elsewhere said  according to reports  that Guantanamo has harmed our relationship with our closest allies and made it more difficult to coordinate efforts in counterterrorism  intelligence and law enforcement          I think we need to own up to the problem that is Guantanamo  and it goes beyond the very serious questions that have already been considered in this hearing about our treatment of detainees   William Taft IV  who was once the acting Secretary of Defense in the first Bush Administration  and then served as the current President Bush s chief legal advisor at the State Department during his first term  recently testified that it is evident that some detainees have been abused at the facility and that interrogation methods that have been used there have not complied with our international obligations under the Geneva Conventions   He also recommended closing the facility   Guantanamo has become associated  in the eyes of the world  with a discredited administration policy of abuse  secrecy  and contempt for the rule of law           Rather than keeping us more secure  keeping Guantanamo open is harming our national interests   It compromises our long term military and strategic interests  and it impairs our standing overseas   I have certainly concluded that we should address any security issues on what to do with the remaining detainees  and then close it once and for all            In his House testimony last month  Secretary Gates called on Congress and the Administration to work together on a plan to close Guantanamo   So my first question is  let me ask each of you  to the extent you feel you can comment  briefly   what do you regard as first  the security hurdles to closing Guantanamo   And secondly  the legal hurdles   Do you want to start Mr  Dell Orto        Mr  Dell Orto    Senator  from a security standpoint when  in the early days  the Department wrestled with a location for what we anticipated might be thousands of detainees   I m talking about in the late fall of 2001 after we had begun combat operations in Afghanistan   we looked at various possibilities  and principally I mean in Afghanistan on the outset  because that s where the conflict was under way   The nature of that combat  the relatively small footprint that we ultimately decided as a matter of how we re going to fight the war on Afghan soil  led to the conclusion that Afghanistan was not going to work   We probably couldn t secure the facility  again if you anticipated getting those sorts of numbers            As you looked around the world for other locations  there didn t appear to be a lot of other areas where  again  you could house large numbers of these sorts of detainees and not fear that there might be an attack on that installation by the terrorist organization itself   The United States was not a good option for these people because  again we anticipated large numbers  the level of violence that they have  in the past  undertaken  the fact that they didn t behave even upon capture as soldiers do  that is a disciplined unit that  once out of the combat or to combat  would sit docilely in a confinement facility  a POW facility   and obey  understand under the law of war they were out of the combat  they are no longer fighting   You couldn t get that out of this group of folks   You had to find some place that was going to be truly secure and the U S  was not going to be an option   Again  contemplating thousands            So Guantanamo became a place that we believed we could literally secure from possible attack against the facility for the purpose of releasing them or creating havoc or what not   So  from the security standpoint  Guantanamo made sense   As it turns out  we have fewer then thousands but again  if you go to that facility and look around it  as perhaps you have  it is a very  very secure environment   And so that s why Guantanamo made sense from a security standpoint          If we talk about now moving to the United States  I think then you bump up against the legal aspect  and that is  are we going to have the full plan of plea constitutional protections for those individuals by virtue of their presence on U S  soil   If we are going to try these people by military commissions  as we have traditionally done for violations of law of armed conflict   the eighteen hundred we did in post World War II Germany  the fifteen hundred or so we did in the Far East theater post World War II to deal with law of war violations   then the military commissions traditionally  historically  and practically are the best way to deal with that   But  they don t necessarily match up when you try to overlay them with the full range of constitutional protections   And so  you do face that legal hurdle were you to bring them to the United States   You could very well wind up not being able to try them by military commission and then practically  rules of evidence and things like that would hamper your ability to get to truth in trying to hold them accountable in a legal system   So security wise  it was a determination made early on  Legally  I think we face that same problem today going forward and I don t know how to reconcile that at this point given the litigation we ve been under  and would clearly wind up with even more litigation were we to bring them to the United States forthcoming         Senator Clinton    Thank you   Admiral Hutson       Admiral Hutson    With respect to my good friend Dan Dell Orto  we ve got  one  a red herring and two  a tired old argument   The red herring is the security  We don t have thousands  we ve got 385   The United States prison system is easily capable of dealing with those   We have tried  tried to try  two people by military commissions from down there   One was a driver and the other was a kangaroo skinner   Some of them are terrible people  I m sure   KSM admitted to everything under the sun  but we don t have 385 people that the United States prison system can t one way or another deal with   We ve got John Walker Lindh in prison now for 20 years  we got Richard Reid in prison for life without parole   The U S  prison system can deal with it            With regard to the legality  we keep wanting to come up to the edge of Gitmo being a legal black hole and the reason they re there is because laws can t touch them and if you bring them back to the United States  the laws suddenly cover them   The United States Supreme Court has decided that issue   The law reaches down to Gitmo   It is not a legal black hole   So  it is not an insurmountable legal problem for the United States court system  which I testified earlier   We should be trumpeting from the roof tops rather than hiding behind the concertino wire of Gitmo   Let s bring them out  show them the light of day  prosecute them  convict those that need to be convicted and sentence them   Acquit those that need to be acquitted and get on with it         Senator Clinton    But  we also are housing  in addition to the people you mention  Omar Abdel Rahman  Ramzi Yousef  Wadih el Hage   We ve got other terrorists who ve actually committed horrific crimes on American soil in super max prisons   Mr  Smith       Mr  Smith    I agree first of all  with the imperative of closing Guantanamo for all the reasons you ve said and the reasons Secretary Gates has articulated   It s an impediment to trying to win the broader war on terror and our standing in the world   The security issues we can clearly deal with as Admiral Hutson said   The legal issues  I see no reason why we can t have military commission trials in the United States   I also see no reason why we cannot use the procedures we talked earlier  before your arrival  of beefing up the procedures for the combat statues tribunals   I don t see why we couldn t do that in this country as well   I m in favor of ultimately restoring habeas corpus once someone has been through the process of a combatant status review tribunals   I don t see why any of that can t be done here   What do we have to fear from this kind of process            Finally  as a political matter  at some point Castro is going to die and we re going to want better relations with the Cubans and my guess is one  first thing a new Cuban government is going to do is ask us to leave Guantanamo in its entirety and we may want a Naval base there   So  I think for all kinds of broader reasons  we need to be thinking very quickly about leaving Guantanamo   In my prepared statement  I suggested that the Congress direct the President to prepare a plan to close Guantanamo and to proceed along the lines of what the Admiral and I have been discussing  and I think that s a worthy thing for this committee to consider       Senator Clinton    Professor       Professor Katyal    Senator  I think you re asking exactly the right question  which is   it s a bigger one then just simply closing Guantanamo  it s what is the legal advice that the Justice Department is giving the President of the United States   And here you ve just heard Mr  Dell Orto testify to this new military commission scheme as being legal and that we can t have these trials in America because  god forbid the constitution might apply   This is the kind of legal advice that says the Constitution is like a tax code and we should look for a loophole here and a loophole there  instead of treating it as our most foundational document   And as a student of history  I know it s hard for the Supreme Court in a time of armed conflict to rebuke the President   You know  you have to really try for the President to lose a case of armed conflict   It s like failing a class at Georgetown or something like that   And here the Administration has managed to do it several times because of this Justice Department advice   They said they won t have habeas corpus rights  Well  the Supreme Court said no in the Rasul case   The Administration said that U S  citizens can be held indefinitely incommunicado   The Supreme Court said no in Hamdi   The Administration said  you can have military commission and try these people   The Supreme Court said no in Hamdan   So the Administration said  Geneva Convention protections can t be given even the most bare bones ones of common article three that that treaty doesn t require it   Supreme Court said no   They repeatedly lose   And I haven t even gotten to stuff like the National Security Agency and torture   This is an Administration and a Justice Department that s just telling the Administration what it wants to hear  instead of actually taking our legal obligations seriously   So  when you hear Mr  Dell Orto say the Military Commission Act is going to be upheld by the courts  I think you should take it with a grain of salt        Senator Clinton    Mr  Denbeaux       Mr  Denbeaux    Senator  I was sitting here thinking about your question and I always go when I have a troubled problem to Occam s Razor  which is the simplest explanation is the best explanation   And the solution to this problem is to try them  to determine who belongs  who gets appropriately prosecuted  treated as enemy combatant and let the rest go   And I m always troubled by when we have a simple solution to a really hard problem  the response is often to make a complicated  difficult  series of choices   And I don t understand for 385 or 400 people why we don t end this sore  lance the boil  have these people have a trial  and then whatever happens  happens            None of the people in the habeas process want anything more than a trial   And if we get a trail  we wouldn t be here   In fact  if there had been article five proceedings on the battle field five years ago  I don t think anybody in this room would be there   The Administration keeps trying to avoid anything but a determination as to whether they re right or wrong   And they especially don t want it done by anybody but the Executive Branch  whether you call it CSRT or something else   And I think all anybody has a right to  whether it s an enemy combatant  American citizens  Senators  or anyone else is the fact that we try people  use our legal system   And the idea that somehow that we can t handle 385 habeas corpus petitions or   any district in the United States handles that many in a week without even blinking an eye   This is not a big problem   It s simply one we don t want to address         Senator Clinton    Mr  Rivkin       Mr  Rivkin    Senator Clinton  in addition to the legal and practical problems that Mr  Dell Orto mentioned  I think some of our subsequent observations on this underscore what I think is a fundamental problem   Guantanamo is not just a piece of geography   I personally would have no problems closing Guantanamo and going somewhere else   But this is a symbol of a fundamental intellectual tension and frankly confusion on the part of many people  because to say for example   and I had lots of discussions with Europeans both government and academia and I asked them   if we moved everybody to Leavenworth and we deployed the same system of sea search and military commissions and the same style of judicial review  would you be happy   And the answer is no   They re not interested in that   Unfortunately  most of our allies are not taking the traditional laws of our paradigm seriously at all   They wouldn t be satisfied with anything other than in essence  a criminal justice paradigm  which  in my view  is utterly impractical to most people  It s very difficult to convince somebody in the criminal system   Inaudible  evidence to collect overseas  You know  famous DNA contamination chain of custody maybe of somebody of an AK 47  follow that person s defense  inaudible  and I m not even a criminal law expert  I would make mincemeat out of a government s argument   How do you know it s an AK 47   How many hands did it got through            But there are far more fundamental problems   We really are present on a clash of fundamental philosophies   Is this a real war   Does the law here apply   Or there s a criminal justice system in which case  with all due respect to my counterperson Denbeaux  you don t need to try people who you capture as enemy combatants   You have the full right to hold them for duration of hostilities  not as a punishment  to make sure it don t go back to combat            And I don t understand one thing   Why is it more charitable to try somebody  as Walker Lindh  and put him in prison  if I am not mistaken  for 25 years   I don t think he d be pardoned by any President   And then you have people who have done at least that much or worse who get released to go to Britain who are sitting drinking beer in a pub right now   To me  if you go down the criminal justice paradigm  it is both under inclusive and over inclusive   It would let people go who shouldn t go and it may be harsh for some people   The mothering justice system actually is far more effective at weeding out people who need to be detained for awhile   And again  would it be really charitable if we tried every single one of those people   And let s pretend for a second that there really are enemy combatants and what are we going to put everybody in prison for 25 of 30 years   Is that going to make anybody happy         Senator Clinton   Well  obviously Mr  Chairman  this is one of these issues on which there are strong feelings   I personally believe that in the eyes of the world  Guantanamo is ammunition for our enemies and it is time to close Guantanamo and to deal with both the security and the legal challenges   There is a lot of land in this country that the federal government owns   There is certainly no shortage of capacity to build a special detention center or prison or to use one of the maximum security facilities that already exist  but I think it would be worth while following up with the comments that Mr  Smith made  about perhaps putting forth some positions from the Congress  so at least this debate would be engaged in a vigorous way  which it deserves to be
