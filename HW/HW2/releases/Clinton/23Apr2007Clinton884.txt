April 23  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Social Security and Medicare Trustees Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Today s report from the Social Security Trustees shows once again that the program relied upon by tens of millions of Americans is not in crisis  that the financial challenges facing the system are manageable  and even shows improvement in the long range health of the system  While the Administration has used previous Trustees reports to portray Social Security as unsustainable and to push for privatization of the system  today s report reiterates evidence from recent years  Trustees reports that Social Security is affordable and sustainable   Taking money out of the Social Security system for private accounts would only exacerbate the system s financial challenges            And while it is good news that the Medicare Trustees Report extends the solvency of the Medicare program by another year  rapid growth in healthcare spending continues to place unsustainable pressure on Medicare and our healthcare system overall   We must make it a priority to reduce costs and improve quality in our healthcare system   Two initiatives that I have spearheaded  the use of health information technology and allowing the Food   Drug Administration to approve safe  affordable generic versions of biologic drugs  would help achieve those important goals
