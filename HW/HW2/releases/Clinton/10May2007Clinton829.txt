May 10  2007 Senator Clinton Urges UN to Recognize Status of Jewish National Fund                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined with a bipartisan coalition of Senators to urge the United Nations to grant general consultative status to the Jewish National Fund of the United States  JNF US    In a letter to the 19 Permanent Representatives who sit on a key United Nations committee  the Senators urged them to vote in favor of granting this status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council  ECOSOC            This letter sends a strong message to the key United Nations committee that we support granting the same access to the Jewish National Fund as others around the world enjoy   By granting general consultative status  the Jewish National Fund will bring regional environmental issues to the table to help foster regional peace in the Middle East   said Senator Clinton           The letter outlined the support of the JNF US and the reasons it should be granted general consultative status   By gaining consultative status at the United Nations  the JNF US will be able to share their environmental expertise with the entire international community by proposing agenda items for discussion  offering expert testimony  and circulating written statements             Currently the U N  allows more than 2 800 NGOs consultative status   In January  the JNF US application was deferred for further consideration on the request of representatives of Qatar and Egypt   The UN committee will be meeting next week to once again take up the Jewish National Fund s application           Senator Clinton was joined by Senators Bob Casey  D PA   Joe Biden  D DE   Chris Dodd  D CT   John Kerry  D MA   Joe Lieberman  D CT   Ben Cardin  D MD   George Voinovich  R OH   Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Gordon Smith  R OR   Dick Durbin  D IL   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   and Norm Coleman  R MN  in sending the letter to the Ambassadors   Over 40 members of the House of Representatives sent a similar letter to the Ambassadors last week           Full text of the letter is below          Dear Ambassador       We are writing to express our strong support for the application of the Jewish National Fund United States  JNF US  for general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council  ECOSOC    Granting the JNF US general consultative status will allow its experts to testify and participate in ECOSOC conferences on areas of its expertise  including sustainable development and water and environmental issues   These issues are key components of the U N  Millennium Developmental Goals of 2015   Currently  more than 2 800 non governmental organizations like the JNF US enjoy consultative status with the U N  ECOSOC          The worldwide family of JNF agencies was founded in 1901   The JNF US was founded in 1926 to raise funds in the United States for the purposes of purchasing and developing agriculturally unproductive land in the British Mandate of Palestine   Since Israel achieved its independence in 1948  the JNF US has dedicated its efforts in Israel to support six major areas  ecology and forestation  water  community development within the June 4  1967 boundaries  research and development  tourism and recreation  and education   The JNF US is a registered 501 c  3  organization in the United States and it has received the highest ratings by Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau          The JNF US is a global environmental leader with an extraordinary record of planting 240 million trees and building 180 reservoirs throughout Israel  providing 15 percent of that nation s water needs   The JNF US s founding in 1991 of the International Arid Lands Consortium enabled it to work closely with Israel s neighbors  including Jordan and Egypt  on multilateral research focused on water supply and land reclamation projects   The JNF US recognizes the role that cooperation and research on environmental issues can play in fostering regional peace in the Middle East            We understand that the U N  ECOSOC Committee on Nongovernmental Organizations  of which your nation is a member  will take up the JNF US s application next week   JNF US representatives have already participated in other United Nations conferences   We believe that granting the JNF US general consultative status with the U N  ECOSOC is an appropriate step that recognizes its constructive efforts on behalf of environmental protection and regional integration in the Middle East   Therefore  we strongly encourage your government to vote in favor of the JNF US application for general consultative status with the U N  ECOSOC                                                     Sincerely
