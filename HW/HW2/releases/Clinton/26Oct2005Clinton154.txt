October 26  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on President Bush  s Reversal of Davis Bacon Act Suspension                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC     President Bush  s decision today to heed our call to reverse his misguided decision to suspend the Davis Bacon Act in the wake of Hurricane Katrina is good news for the working men and women of the Gulf States   As I said when we sent President Bush a letter calling on him to take this action  it is absolutely critical that those affected by Hurricane Katrina receive fair wages as they struggle to get back on their feet and rebuild their lives   We have a moral obligation to do everything we can to help put these families on the road to recovery   Suspending Davis Bacon simply served to put a road block in their path   And that  s why I introduced legislation to reinstate Davis Bacon           Davis Bacon protections are critical to ensuring that workers get fair pay for a hard day  s work   Prevailing wages mean that workers can afford the rising price of gas as well as the increasing costs of health care  food  tuition and other necessities of life   Undermining this core worker protection law was short sighted and today  s action by the President while welcome  is long overdue
