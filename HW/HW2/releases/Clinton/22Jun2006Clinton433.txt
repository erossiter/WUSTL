June 22  2006 Clinton and Markey Push for Tighter Controls on Nuclear Materials that Could be Used to Make a Dirty Bomb                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Clinton Presses Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman for Action at Senate Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Representative Edward Markey  MA  today called on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  to tighten controls on nuclear materials that could be used to create a dirty bomb   Senator Clinton and Representative Markey secured passage of an amendment to the Energy Bill that required a cradle to grave  national tracking system for materials that could be used to make a dirty bomb in order to reduce the risk that terrorists could obtain these materials   However  the NRC has made the short sighted and ill considered decision that controlling these materials is not a security issue and should not be a federal responsibility   Instead  they have deemed this a public health and safety issue and pushed responsibility for implementing the tracking system to the states  effectively eliminating the ability of the NRC to enforce compliance   In a letter to the Chairman of the NRC  Senator Clinton and Congressman Markey called on the NRC to abide by the stricter standard set by the law and make controlling these nuclear materials the federal security priority this threat requires   Senator Clinton pressed NRC Chairman Nils Diaz and the commissioners of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to act today at a hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee               The threat of a dirty bomb is a security risk   It is outrageous that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission doesn  t agree   This is just one more example of failure to ensure our homeland security   New York remains a top threat of terrorist attack  and a dirty bomb attack would wreak economic havoc in addition to the risk to human life and health posed by the blast and radiation   In the post 9 11 world  it is unacceptable that the NRC would abdicate its responsibility to track nuclear materials   We need national tracking of nuclear materials that could be used to make a dirty bomb to make sure they don  t fall into the wrong hands     said Senator Clinton            Congress enacted the   Dirty Bomb Protection Act    not the   Try Not to Accidentally Lose the Cesium Act       said Rep  Markey     The NRC needs to follow the law to make sure that radiation sources that could be used by a terrorist to build a dirty bomb are kept track of by the federal government             Senator Clinton emphasized to the NRC Chairman and commissioners the extent of this security challenge   The NRC has issued more than 150 000 licenses authorizing the use of radioactive materials for industrial  medical and other uses  and approximately 1 8 million devices containing radioactive materials have been distributed under these licenses   According to a 2003 GAO report  since 1998  there have been more than 1 300 incidents where radiation sources were lost  stolen or abandoned   Senator Clinton emphasized that it is critical that we do a better job controlling these radiation sources and that it is a critical homeland security issue          The following is the text of the letter from Senator Clinton and Representative Markey to the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission          The Honorable Nils J  Diaz  Chairman  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  11555 Rockville Pike  Rockville  MD  20852      Dear Chairman Diaz       We are writing regarding the Commission  s May 25  2006 action on   Decision Item  Secy 06 0080 National Source Tracking Of Sealed Sources     The Commission  s actions changed the basis for the rulemaking from   common defense and security   to   public health and safety    thereby allowing the Agreement States to implement the tracking system rather than ensuring that the implementation occurs at the federal level   We believe this could have adverse impacts on the security of materials that could be used to construct dirty bombs  and runs counter to the intent of Congress when it directed the Commission to establish a tracking system in the Energy Bill last year          As you know  we are the authors of the   Dirty Bomb Prevention Act     portions of which were offered as amendments to the Energy Bill  H R  6  and enacted into law last summer  The enacted provisions of the   Dirty Bomb Prevention Act       contained in Section 651 of the Act  added a new Section 170H to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954   Under this provision of the law  the Commission was directed to establish a tracking system for radiation sources  which were defined by law to include Category 1 and 2 sources as well as   any other material that poses a threat such that the material is subject to this section  as determined by the Commission  by regulation  other than spent nuclear fuel and special nuclear materials     which would              A  enable the identification of each radiation source by serial number or other unique identifier            B  require reporting within 7 days of any change of possession of a radiation source            C  require reporting within 24 hours of any loss of control of  or accountability for  a radiation source  and           D  provide for reporting under subparagraphs  B  and  C  through a secure Internet connection          While there is certainly a nexus between safety and security  the motivation for our legislation was the security of these materials   The Commission clearly understood this    for example  Commissioner Merrifield  s views supporting the change in basis stated that   Additionally  if sources in the tracking system are covertly or accidentally identified to outside groups  they could become a preferred target for terrorists     In its May 25 decision  however  the Commission inexplicably switched courses from the   common defense and security   approach to   public health and safety              The successful detonation of a dirty bomb could cause widespread fatalities and injuries  panic  environmental contamination and economic harm    We agree with Commissioner Jaczko  s belief that the   NRC has a responsibility to impose security requirements under its common defense and security authority because of the real security threats that exist     We strongly urge the Commission to reconsider its decision to approve its regulation on the basis of   public safety and security    and return to the   common defense and security   approach which we believe is necessary in order to faithfully implement Congressional intent   Moreover  given the importance of this matter  we also urge you to extend the 20 day timeframe in which the public may respond to the Commission  s proposal   In addition  we also ask for your prompt attention in responding to the following questions          1      According to Commissioner McGaffigan  s views the Commission was told that   an informal poll of twenty four States revealed that five States were not supportive of the basis switch  California  which alone regulates 20  of the total national inventory of radioactivity in Category 1 and 2 sources  and New York are among the five who do not support the switch  and neither of these States expressed an interest in an agreement under section 274i of the Atomic Energy Act to assist NRC in carrying out its responsibilities      Please provide complete documentation regarding this informal poll  as well as other interactions with the Agreement States on the creation of the tracking system  including copies of all correspondence  emails  faxes  meeting notes  memos  telephone logs and any other materials          2      According to Commissioner McGaffigan  s views  the NRC staff may have advocated for the switch in basis partly because of budgetary concerns  evidently assuming that in its first year of operation  the NRC would be   checking 100  of licensees in the first year  and expending 20 FTE and  750 000        a      Please provide copies of all staff analysis regarding the budgetary needs for NRC to implement a national tracking system        b      Did staff attempt to identify the necessary resources with which to implement the national tracking system within NRC  s existing funds  If so  what was the outcome        c      If no resources were identified within existing NRC funds  did the NRC ever attempt to request that such funds be provided by Congress  If not  why not        d      Where will the Agreement States obtain funds to implement their own tracking programs   Will the NRC provide such funding   How much will the establishment and implementation of such systems cost each State          3      As you know  radiation sources are often transferred between entities within the U S   or shipped to different geographical locations by their owners   How will the Agreement States be expected to coordinate the tracking of sources when such transfers occur   Who ultimately will be responsible for ensuring that when a radiation source is shipped out of one Agreement State  the Agreement State to which it is sent will be immediately informed           4      If a radiation source located in one Agreement State is reported as missing  lost or stolen  will the Agreement State be responsible for informing a  the Commission  b  any or all of the other Agreement States  c  State or local law enforcement authorities in the Agreement State in which the source went missing  d  State or local law enforcement authorities in nearby Agreement States or e  federal law enforcement authorities  What are the required timeframes for such reporting            5      Please provide a complete timeline for the process of adding Category 3 sources to the tracking system  listing the analysis that is required and deadlines for its completion           6      As you know  earlier this year the Government Accountability office  GAO  successfully smuggled enough radioactive materials suitable for use in a small dirty bomb into the country across the Canadian border   In your May 2  2006 response to a March 28  2006 letter from Rep  Markey on this subject  you said that the Commission was   committed to working with CBP  Customs and Border Protection  part of the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  and other elements of DHS  as well as the Agreement States  to provide CBP easier access on a 24 hour a day basis to the information needed to confirm that shipments of risk significant sources are legitimate           a  There are 34 different Agreement States   Will every CBP official who might be confronted with shipments of radiation sources have 24 hour a day access to an official in each Agreement State in the event questions arise about a particular shipment  Will CBP officials basically be forced to decide which of 34 officials to contact  instead of contacting a single office at the NRC as they can currently do        b  Does every Agreement State employ personnel whose job it will be to be on duty on a 24 hour a day basis in order to respond to such calls          c  If not  then couldn  t allowing the Agreement States to implement the tracking system result in a degradation of the security associated with these sources due to delays and or inabilities to obtain rapid access to information regarding particular shipments  If not  why not   d  As you know  in October  2004 two radiation sources were imported from Russia by Halliburton and were supposed to be shipped to Texas upon their arrival in New York  Instead  they were mistakenly shipped to a warehouse in Chelsea  Massachusetts where they remained for several months until they were finally reported missing in February 2005   Under the new tracking system  under this scenario  when and to whom would the licensee be expected to report a newly imported source  assuming a future event such as this involved a Category 1 or 2 source  as missing    the appropriate official in New York  or Texas  or both   What would the official s  then be expected to do           7      It is our understanding that the Commission will be including Category 3 sources in the tracking system  We applaud this decision and encourage its prompt adoption   However  we are concerned that this could pose additional problems if it is left to the Agreement States to implement        a  Isn  t it true that currently  only some Agreement States regulate Category 3 materials  Please provide a list of Agreement States that do so        b  Would the Agreement States that do not currently regulate Category 3 materials be expected to begin to do so  If so  what would that entail  Please provide an estimate of the costs associated with the assumption of such a responsibility for each State that does not currently regulate Category 3 sources          8      A February 26  2006 report by the NRC Inspector General  IG  entitled   Audit of the Development of the National Source Tracking System  NSTS     found that the proposed tracking system   may not account for all byproduct material that represents a risk to the common defense and security and public health and safety  Such risks could result in economic  psychological  and physical harm to the United States and public      This report made 2 recommendations  1  to conduct a comprehensive regulatory analysis for the NSTS that explores other viable options and 2  to validate the existing data in the Interim Database   Were these recommendations followed prior to the Commission vote   If so  what was the outcome  If not  why not          9      Will the tracking system consider transactions involving the aggregation of sources whose activity levels  if taken together  exceed the Category 2 threshold  If not  why not  since the security and safety threats associated with such a transaction would be the same as that associated with a transaction involving a single Category 2 level source          10  It is our understanding that the NRC  s import export rule for radiation sources does apply to aggregation of sources whose activity levels  if taken together  exceed the Category 2 threshold   Does this mean that if someone overseas wishes to send such an aggregation of sources to the U S   that the importation will be tracked until the sources reach the U S   after which they might be essentially ignored if such aggregated sources are not included in the tracking system   How can this be justified from a security and safety perspective          Thank you for your attention to this important matter   Please provide your response no later than Friday June  30  2006            Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton  Edward J  Markey
