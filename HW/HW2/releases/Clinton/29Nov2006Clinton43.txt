November 29  2006 Senator Clinton Calls on CDC to Address Continuing Problems in Flu Vaccine Production and Distribution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Urges Action as Nation Marks National Influenza Vaccination Week                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  to take action to address repeated problems in production and distribution of flu vaccine   In a letter to CDC Director Julie Gerberding  Senator Clinton praised efforts to increase education by designating this week National Influenza Vaccination Week   However  Senator Clinton noted that providers in New York and around the country have experienced problems yet again this year getting the vaccine supply they need in a timely fashion   Senator Clinton has introduced legislation  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  which would modernize production and distribution of flu vaccine to improve our ability to prepare for the predictable annual occurrence of the season flu and to respond to the potential threat of an avian flu outbreak or flu pandemic              We may have record amounts of vaccine produced for this flu season  but such high production levels do us no good if the vaccine is not available when and where it is needed     said Senator Clinton     It is unacceptable that we have faced multiple delays and shortages since 2000 and still have not made the changes necessary to our vaccine distribution system to address these concerns that appear year after year after year             The following is the text of Senator Clinton  s letter to CDC Director Gerberding          Julie Louise Gerberding  M D   M P H   Director  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Department of Health   Human Services  1600 Clifton Road  N W    Atlanta  Georgia 30329      Dear Dr  Gerberding        I am pleased to see that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   in partnership with provider  patient and public health groups  has designated this week as National Influenza Vaccination Week   While many Americans traditionally think of Thanksgiving as the end of the flu vaccination season  late season vaccinations  such as those delivered in December or January  also provide protection against the seasonal flu   Encouraging late season vaccination will not only allow us to increase vaccination rates among priority populations  such as senior citizens and persons living with chronic illness  but also educate all Americans about the benefits of receiving an annual flu shot   Education is critical   However  if we are to ensure that all Americans get the flu vaccines they need  we must also address the repeated problems in production and distribution of vaccine           This year  delays in the production and distribution of vaccine left many providers unable to vaccinate all their patients who sought flu shots in October and November   According to guidance put out by your own agency  some providers have still not received the full supply of the vaccines that they have ordered   My office has received reports that providers in New York State are still waiting for their final shipments to arrive   Some have cancelled portions of their orders reporting that there is not enough demand for the flu shot when late season vaccinations finally arrive   After waiting so long for these supplies to arrive  many providers are predicting that they will have vaccine left over   In New York and across the country  we may have record amounts of vaccine produced for this flu season  but such high production levels do us no good if the vaccine is not available when needed          I understand that unforeseen complications  such as slow growing strains or improper handling during distribution  can delay the delivery of vaccine to providers and patients  However  it is unacceptable that we have faced multiple delays and shortages since 2000 and still have not made the changes necessary to our vaccine distribution system to address these concerns that appear year after year after year   I know that both of us share the goal of increasing influenza vaccination rates among both priority populations and the general public  Yet it is hard to encourage patients to seek annual vaccination if they will continually be turned away or referred to other locations           To address the delays faced this year  organizations such as the American Medical Association  the Medical Society of the State of New York  public health departments  and other state and local professional organizations have identified and facilitated the redistribution of vaccine to areas where resources are scarce    an ad hoc solution which has helped to allay concerns for the time being   However  we cannot rely on ad hoc solutions every year   It is long past time for us to establish a seasonal flu vaccine tracking system to enable providers to more accurately determine when they might receive their orders   With such a system in place  we could have a reliable method of identifying areas of shortage and facilitating distribution to those areas  rather than setting up new systems every time we have another delay          I have proposed such a tracking system in the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  a bill that I have introduced with Senator Pat Roberts   The tracking system in this legislation builds upon the current private system of distribution  and would link information through a national database in a manner that does not jeopardize free market competition   The model in this bill could also serve as a dual use tracking system that could be utilized in both seasonal and pandemic situations   If we have a tracking system that is operational for our seasonal flu vaccine distribution  we can avoid reliance on untried mechanisms in an emergency situation where we will already be facing multiple obstacles to delivery of health care          Encouraging late season vaccination is important  but it is just one component in ensuring that our nation  s system of flu vaccine production and distribution operates smoothly   I believe that the CDC must take all steps necessary to work with manufacturers  distributors  patients  providers  and other stakeholders to resolve continued difficulties as soon as possible   By working to speed implementation of a tracking system and improve communication about the manufacturing process  we can improve the ability to meet demand on a timely basis in the 2007 2008 flu season          I look forward to working with you to address these issues and strengthen our ability to protect Americans against the flu           Sincerely yours      Hillary Rodham Clinton
