January 9  2006 Clinton Calls for Hearing   Investigation Into Inadequate Body Armor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Calls on Army to Provide Additional Body Armor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    In response to press reports this weekend saying that had more extensive body armor been supplied to our troops in Iraq  lives of US troops could have been saved  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called for          A Senate Armed Services Committee hearing to investigate these reports            A GAO  Government Accountability Office  investigation to focus on how the Pentagon  s procurement decisions were made for this equipment            The Army to make every effort to provide additional body armor in the most expeditious manner possible to our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan            The full text of the three letters sent by Senator Clinton are below          The Honorable John Warner  Chairman  Committee on Armed Services  United States Senate  SR   225  Washington  D C   20510       Dear Mr  Chairman        I am writing to urge that the Senate Armed Services Committee convene hearings as soon as possible to investigate the recent press reports that had more extensive body armor been supplied to our troops  it could have saved the lives of more than 80 percent of the Marines killed by upper body wounds in Iraq between 2003 and 2005   Under your leadership  the Senate Armed Services Committee has been a strong advocate for our men and women in uniform and I know that you share my concerns about these recent reports              According to press reports  a Pentagon study not yet made public has concluded that greater body armor protection could have saved lives in Iraq   Indeed  the number of lives lost to inadequate body armor could reach the hundreds if Army deaths attributable to inadequate armor not included in this survey are counted as well           Since the beginning of our engagement in Iraq  I  along with my colleagues  have repeatedly expressed concern about delays in equipping our troops serving overseas  including adequate body armor   In response to these concerns  the Pentagon had assured the Committee that problems regarding body armor had been solved    However  these disturbing press reports about inadequate body armor suggest that lives may have been needlessly lost because of inadequate equipment   According to these press reports  additional ceramic armor plates cost approximately  260 a set  a small price to pay to protect a soldier          These reports come in the context of numerous problems that have been reported during the past year regarding body armor for our troops   In April 2005  the Government Accountability Office found that there were delays in body armor acquisition as well as ineffective distribution   In May 2005  the Marine Corps Times reported that the Corps issued inadequate body armor to nearly 10 000 troops   Government experts urged the Corps to reject the armor after tests revealed critical  life threatening flaws in the vests   In October 2005  it was disclosed that the Pentagon was not implementing a program to reimburse troops who purchased their own body armor   Only after public pressure did the Pentagon relent          With United States troops risking their lives daily in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  we owe it to them to make sure they have the best equipment possible   According to these recent reports  the Pentagon is failing that responsibility           The Senate Armed Services Committee has a unique role in congressional oversight of the Pentagon and in ensuring that our troops have the equipment they need   I urge you to call hearings as soon as possible to investigate these recent reports and hold the Pentagon accountable for providing adequate armor for our men and women in uniform          Today  I am also writing to Army Secretary Francis Harvey to urge the Army to overcome delays in providing additional body armor protection for our troops   I am also writing to the Government Accountability office to ask that they investigate how the Pentagon made the decision to provide inadequate armor for our troops           Thank you for your consideration            Sincerely yours            Hillary Rodham Clinton         CC   The Honorable Carl Levin           Ranking Member           Committee on Armed Services           United States Senate       The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street   N W   Washington  D C   20548         Dear Mr  Walker          In light of the latest revelations on body armor vulnerabilities  I am writing to urge the General Accountability Office  GAO  to investigate how procurement decisions were made for this equipment           Recent press reports have revealed that a study by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner suggest that more extensive armor  since 2003  could have saved the lives of more than              80 percent of the Marines killed by upper body wounds in Iraq between 2003 and 2005   The study concluded that greater body armor protection could have saved lives in Iraq   Indeed the number of lives lost to inadequate body armor could reach the hundreds if Army deaths attributable to inadequate armor are counted as well           The GAO has conducted an ongoing investigation of the Pentagon  s acquisition and distribution of body armor   In April 2005  the Government Accountability Office found that there were delays in body armor acquisition as well as ineffective distribution   I request that you expand your investigation to include the military  s effectiveness in providing body armor designed to limit fatalities and injuries to our troops   According to these recent press reports  the Pentagon  s bureaucratic procurement process is hindering its ability to equip our forces with the best equipment in a timely manner          With United States troops serving bravely in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  we owe it to them to ensure that they have the best equipment possible             I look forward to your prompt response          Sincerely yours            Hillary Rodham Clinton       The Honorable Francis J  Harvey  Secretary  Department of the Army  The Pentagon  Washington  D C   20310         Dear Mr  Secretary          In light of the latest revelations on body armor vulnerabilities  I urge the Army to make every effort to provide additional body armor in the most expeditious manner possible to our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan          Recent press reports have revealed that a study by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner suggest that more extensive armor  since 2003  could have saved the lives of more than 80 percent of the Marines killed by upper body wounds in Iraq between 2003 and 2005   The study concluded that greater body armor protection could have saved lives in Iraq   Indeed the number of lives lost to inadequate body armor could reach the hundreds if Army deaths attributable to inadequate armor not included in this survey are counted as well           According to these press reports  the Army is still deciding what body armor plates to purchase   With every day the Army delays the decision of which additional body armor to procure  we put more of our men and women at risk   Now is not the time to allow the bureaucratic process of Army procurement to interfere with providing the best equipment to our troops serving in harm  s way            In addition  I would like my staff to be briefed on the study by the Armed Forces Medical Examiner that has not yet been made public            Our soldiers make up the best fighting force in the world   We owe them nothing less than our fullest efforts in providing them the best gear now          I look forward to your prompt response   Thank you for your consideration            Sincerely yours            Hillary Rodham Clinton
