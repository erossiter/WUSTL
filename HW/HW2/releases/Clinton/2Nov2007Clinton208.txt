November 2  2007 Clinton  Schumer  Lautenberg  Menendez  Nadler  Maloney  Fossella Announce Congressional Approval of  52 5 Million to Expand Health Coverage for 9 11 Emergency Responders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Funding Comes as Thousands of Patients are Seeking Treatment for 9 11 Related Illnesses  with Numbers Rising   Funds to Expand Treatment to Residents  Office and Commercial Workers  Students  and Other Individuals   Call for Focus on Long Term  Comprehensive Solution to Screen and Monitor All Individuals Who Were Exposed to the Environmental Hazards After the September 11th Attac  Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  Frank Lautenberg  and Robert Menendez  along with Representatives Jerrold Nadler  Carolyn Maloney  and Vito Fossella today announced that the Joint House and Senate Conference Committee has approved an additional  52 5 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center     The funding  which comes in addition to the  50 million that was provided in the recent Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill  was included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill by the Senate Labor  HHS  Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee  The bill  having been approved by the Conference Committee  must now be approved by both chambers of Congress  If it is passed by the House and Senate it will then be sent to the President for his signature    This is great news for those who still suffer from the lingering effects of the 9 11 attacks  Senator Clinton said  Todays conference committee approval of this additional funding is vital to the first responders  building and construction trades workers  volunteers  office workers  residents  students  and others who are experiencing health problems from the exposure to toxic substances released by the attacks  It is our national responsibility to care for those who did our country proud in the hours  days  weeks  or months following the horrific attacks  This announcement gives us renewed hope that the funding needed to carry on these vital health tracking and treatment services will be delivered  and I strongly urge the President to sign this critical legislation into law    Congress has now given final approval to this vital funding and now the Administration must do the same  The brave men and women whose will and strength carried us through the days after 9 11 and now suffer from debilitating illnesses because of their work at Ground Zero deserve no less  For far too long  the administration has refused to fully fund the many clinics and programs that serve the heroes still suffering from the affects of 9 11  and those yet to develop symptoms  That is simply not right  We will continue to fight for full funding for our first responders and others to ensure they receive the attention and care they deserve  Schumer said    First responders  emergency workers and volunteers showed true courage during the recovery effort after the 9 11 terrorist attacks   Now  many of these brave men and women are suffering serious illnesses from the toxins at Ground Zero  said Lautenberg  I urge the President to rethink his irresponsible veto threat so these heroes can get the treatment they deserve    Six years after 9 11  the toll of those terrorist attacks continues to rise  said Sen  Menendez  Without this kind of strong federal commitment to monitor and treat all who inhaled the toxic dust  there are many more who will suffer  This is a tremendously important investment in the human recovery from 9 11   I applaud the committee for its landmark decision to include funding for the monitoring and treatment of area residents  workers and students who are suffering as a result of 9 11  said Rep  Nadler   After years of pushing and prodding  I am pleased that the new Democratic majority in Congress was able to both fulfill its promise of funding and to broaden funding to include all affected populations   I urge the President to fulfill Americas moral obligation to the victims of 9 11 and support this measure   And  I am hopeful that we can someday soon devise a long term  comprehensive solution that is not subject to these annual budget battles    This bill gives 9 11 health clinics the funding they need to keep their doors open  said Maloney  The New York delegation has worked hard to extend proper care to everyone who is suffering as a result of exposure to toxins at Ground Zero  I urge President Bush to sign this bill into law    Fossella said  It is essential that funding is available to monitor those who were exposed to the air over Ground Zero and treat all who are sick and injured  A comprehensive and funded federal plan needs to be established so that the health and monitoring programs have a degree of certainty and that their future is not left to the whims of the appropriations process    Specifically  the  52 5 million will go towards screening  monitoring and treatment activities administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to help those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released on and after 9 11  The bill also includes language requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to expand the program beyond responders and rescue workers to entities that would provide services to residents  office and commercial workers  students  and other individuals who were exposed  Existing programs to serve those who were impacted include the centers in the Mt Sinai Consortium and the program run by the New York City Fire Department    The lawmakers said that the approved funding is a recognition of the importance of addressing the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  and affirms the commitment of the federal government to provide assistance to those whose physical and mental health was adversely impacted as a result of this exposure  More than six years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among those who have been exposed
