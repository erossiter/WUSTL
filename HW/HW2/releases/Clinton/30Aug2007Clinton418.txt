August 30  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding NRC Issuing Notice of Violation to Entergy for Missing Another Deadline to Have New Indian Point Alert and Notification System in Operation                                                                                                                                                                                                                 The NRC took an important step today   If FEMA finds fault with the new system  then I urge the NRC to take the next step by pursuing appropriate enforcement action  and by using any enforcement flexibility available to them to redirect fines to local governments for emergency preparedness  I continue to believe that Entergys failure to meet the deadline is unacceptable  and I will also be asking the Department of Homeland Securitys  DHS  inspector general to evaluate what went wrong   I also remain convinced of the need to conduct an Independent Safety Assessment at Indian Point as I believe that the best way for Entergy to demonstrate its confidence in Indian Point is to invite independent inspectors inside to examine the plant alongside the NRC    The Nuclear Regulatory Commission today issued a Notice of Violation to Entergy for its repeated failure to meet established deadlines to achieve operability of a new alert and notification system for the Indian Point nuclear power plant     Last week  more than two years after a law was passed requiring a new siren system to be put in place  and more than six months after the original deadline  Entergy announced that the new system is ready  Unfortunately  because the full set of test data was not submitted until last week  there was no way that the August 24 deadline could be met  At the time  Senator Clinton expressed her serious concerns over the situation and announced that she would be asking the DHS inspector general to evaluate what went wrong      Since September 11th Senator Clinton has worked to push both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  and Entergy to improve safety  security and emergency preparedness at the plant  including the siren system  Senator Clinton added a provision to the energy bill in 2005 to require Entergy to install a new siren system with battery backup in response to repeated failures of the Indian Point siren system due to a lack of backup power   That provision was signed into law in August of 2005  and the NRC set a January 2007 deadline for having the system operational   Entergy applied for and received an extension of the deadline to April 15th  and subsequently missed the deadline   NRC fined Entergy  130 000 and Senator Clinton announced that she would sponsor Senate companion legislation to a bill to be sponsored in the U S  House by Congresswoman Nita Lowey  D Westchester Rockland  and Congressman John Hall  D Hudson Valley   that would steer fines levied by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for safety violations to counties surrounding nuclear facilities in order to assist them with emergency planning        Senator Clinton has also continued to call for the NRC to conduct an Independent Safety Assessment  ISA  at Indian Point and has introduced legislation to require an ISA at the plant      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Indian Point
