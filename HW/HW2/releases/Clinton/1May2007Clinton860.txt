                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Continuing her efforts to push for an end to the genocide in Darfur  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined a bipartisan group of senators in calling on China to step up pressure on Sudan to end the crisis in Darfur that has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and displaced millions more   In a letter to Chinese President Hu Jintao  the senators outlined the need for China to impress upon Sudanese President al Bashir the need to halt Sudan s military operations throughout Darfur  accept a robust African Union United Nations  AU UN  peacekeeping force  and ensure humanitarian assistance can be provided safely             As an emerging world leader  China has an important role to play in ensuring the Sudanese government takes measures to immediately end the violence in Darfur  China must accept the full African Union United Nations peacekeeping force and facilitate humanitarian assistance   said Senator Clinton   The international community is increasingly looking for China to demonstrate the will and the leadership that is so critical to resolving this crisis  I hope China will use its significant influence to do the right thing           The letter to President Hu urges the Chinese government to work together with the international community to send a clear message to Sudan that it must embrace a path to peace and reconciliation by complying with current UN Security Council resolutions and the UN brokered ceasefire   In addition  the letter calls for the Chinese government to reconsider its decision to provide the government of Sudan with an interest free loan to build a presidential palace  The letter requests that President Hu share information with the United States Senate as to what actions China intends to take to protect civilians in Darfur           Since 2004  Senator Clinton has called repeatedly for action in Darfur  Most recently  Senator Clinton joined a bipartisan group of Senators in sending a letter to President Bush calling for greater action by the UN Security Council against Sudan  She also co sponsored a resolution calling on the United States Government and the international community to develop  fund  and implement a comprehensive regional strategy in Africa to protect civilians  facilitate humanitarian operations  contain and reduce violence  and contribute to conditions for sustainable peace in Darfur  as well as in eastern Chad and northern Central African Republic  and Darfur  Sudan  S Res 76    S  Res  76 passed the Senate earlier this month          The full text of the letter to President Hu follows             His Excellency Hu Jintao  c o Ambassador Zhou Wenzhong  Embassy of the People s Republic of China  2300 Connecticut Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20008      Dear President Hu       We write to request your assistance on a matter of grave mutual concern requiring urgent action            The devastating crisis in western Sudan has escalated despite United Nations Security Council Resolution 1706  and the subsequent agreement brokered by the United Nations late last year in Addis Ababa to establish a joint African Union UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur   Simply put  the African Union Mission in Sudan  AMIS  has not had the troop level  financial resources  institutional capacity or mandate to protect civilians or humanitarian organizations in Darfur    Sudanese President Omar al Bashir recently sent a disturbing letter to UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon in which he backed away from the Addis agreement to implement phases II and III  the heavy support package and a robust UN peacekeeping force   Last week  he apparently reversed himself and agreed to move forward with the heavy support package  but given his record of stonewalling we need to keep the pressure on until peacekeepers are actually deployed   It is also essential that President Bashir s decision to allow the second phase of the U N  deployment not be used as a rationale for Khartoum s rejection of the full hybrid AU UN force authorized in UNSC Resolution 1706          The conflict waged by Sudanese government forces and government backed Janjawid militias against armed rebel groups has driven more than 230 000 Darfuri refugees into Chad  and displaced more than 120 000 Chadians   Hundreds of thousands of Darfuri civilians have been killed and an estimated 2 million displaced in Darfur itself   The conflict has had particularly devastating consequences for women and children  who make up the vast majority of victims  Humanitarian operations have also been increasingly attacked and disrupted in recent months  leaving millions without access to the most basic assistance          We appreciate the steps the international community and China have taken to confront war crimes and other egregious human rights violations in Darfur   The President s Special Envoy for Sudan  Andrew Natsios  recently told Congress that China may have been  the critical factor  in Sudan s decision to accept important portions of the Kofi Annan plan   That is an important contribution   By continuing to work together  in our complementary ways  the United States and China can achieve more   In this regard we urge China to reassess its recent decision to provide the Government of Sudan with an interest free loan to build a presidential palace   We believe extending such a loan would clearly send the wrong message to Khartoum   We hope that you will reconsider the loan and impress upon President al Bashir the need to halt Sudan s military operations throughout Darfur  to withdraw Sudanese troops from the area  and to follow through on its agreement to accept a robust AU UN peacekeeping force in Darfur   These steps  at a minimum  are essential to enforce the ceasefire  protect civilians  ensure access to humanitarian assistance  and begin the path to reconstruction and reconciliation in Darfur          As Members of the U S  Senate  our primary objectives in this endeavor  and those of our constituents across the United States  are to protect civilians in Darfur  end the violence  find a just resolution to the political conflict  and begin the long path to reconstruction and reconciliation          We must now work together as an international community  there is no time left to wait   We therefore appeal to you today to use your influence in words and in deeds to protect civilians   China has a lead role to play in ensuring that President al Bashir accept the best and most reasonable path to peace  and that he agree to move forward with the heavy support package and the full contingent of UN peacekeepers and related personnel in Darfur   We would appreciate any information you can share on actions China intends to take to protect civilians in Darfur          Sincerely            Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the crisis in Darfur
