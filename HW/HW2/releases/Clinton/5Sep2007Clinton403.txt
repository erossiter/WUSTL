September 5  2007 Letter from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to President Bush                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Click here to download a PDF   The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    In the wake of your recent trip to Iraq and as your Administration prepares to submit its Congressionally mandated report on progress in Iraq by September 15  it is important that the American people have an accurate perception of the situation in Iraq   In order to provide a complete picture to the American people of current conditions in Iraq  I write to request that the Administrations report address the issues listed below and that General Petraeus  the Commander  Multi National Forces Iraq  MNF I  and Ambassador Ryan Crocker  the U S  Ambassador to Iraq  be prepared to discuss these issues when they appear before Congress prior to the delivery of the September 15 report     1   When you announced the escalation of U S  forces in Iraq  you said that the increase would provide the Iraqis with the space necessary for political reconciliation   Why has the increase in U S  forces in Iraq not translated to the desired reconciliation effect that would facilitate the passage of meaningful legislation including equitable distribution of oil resources and revenues  constitutional reform  militia disarmament programs  and scheduling of local and provincial elections    2   The declassified key judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate  NIE  Prospects for Iraqs Stability states that in the next six to 12 months  the Iraqi Government will continue to struggle to achieve national level political reconciliation and improved governance   If the escalation was supposed to lead to political reconciliation  do you agree with the NIE key judgments that reflect that this goal is unlikely to be attained in the next six to 12 months     3   The declassified key judgments of the NIE assess that the level of overall violence in Iraq remains high  Iraqs sectarian groups remain unreconciled  and al Qaida in Iraq  AQI  retains the ability to conduct high profile attacks  What factors are preventing U S  and Iraqi Security Forces  ISF  from maintaining the initiative at the local level and defeating insurgents and extremist networks that still retain operational and strategic capabilities      4   The declassified key judgments of the NIE state that the Iraqi Army is still not capable of conducting independent major operations   Indeed  the newly released Government Accountability Office  GAO  report Securing  Stabilizing  and Rebuilding Iraq  Iraqi Government Has Not Met Most Legislative  Security  and Economic Benchmarks concludes that benchmarks on Iraqi Army capabilities have not been met   In fact  the ISF is not improving and the number of Iraqi army units capable of operating independently declined from ten this past March to six this past July   Why is the overall unit capability trend line declining   Will Iraqi Army assessments provided in the NIE and the GAO report be reconciled in the September 15th report in order to fully understand the scope of Iraqi Army capabilities and combat proficiencies      5   Press reports indicate that the Congressionally mandated commission to examine the Iraqi Security Forces led by General James Jones  Retired  will recommend remaking the 26 000 member Iraqi National Police  INP  force to purge it of corrupt officers and Shiite militants suspected of complicity in sectarian killings   Why has there been little success thus far in reforming the INP   Why hasnt the Iraqi government made reforming the police a top priority   If endemic corruption and the inability of the INP to support the rule of law were known in 2002 and 2003  and as press reports describing the Jones Report suggest continues  why have wholesale INP reforms taken this long to implement    6   The GAO report Securing  Stabilizing  and Rebuilding Iraq   Iraqi Government Has Not Met Most Legislative  Security  and Economic Benchmarks concludes that the benchmark of ensuring that the ISF are providing even handed enforcement of the law has not been met   In fact the report assesses that the ISF engages in sectarian based abuses   Have ISF sectarian loyalties hampered operational success   Will these conclusions be reflected in the September 15th report    7   Recent press reports suggest that Iraqi intelligence operations are fueling sectarian violence and promoting sectarian agendas   What is the assessment of the Iraqi intelligence services and their ability to provide objective intelligence support to ISF operations        8   What is the strategy for addressing the influence of Muqtada al Sadr s Jaysh al Mahdi  JAM  militia to the security and political situation in Iraq   Were JAMs recent activities fueling sectarian violence and what were their roles in attacks of U S  and Iraqi forces      9   What are the nationalities of suicide bombers and foreign fighters conducting attacks in Iraq   What efforts are being made by the U S  and Iraq to stem the flow of suicide bombers and foreign fighters from these countries     10   On August 10  2007 the United Nations Security Council approved a resolution to expand the role of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq  UNAMI  in Iraqs reconstruction process    What will be the future role of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq  UNAMI  in coordinating reconstruction and aid distribution  regional dialogue  refugee and humanitarian assistance  and reconciliation efforts   Will UNAMI personnel and mission support specialists be able to operate independently given the current security situation in Iraq   What security arrangements and support will MNF I and the ISF provide to the UNAMI mission     11   What steps  if any  are being taken to address the under representation of Sunnis in provincial councils      12   Since the beginning of the escalation  has the number of internally displaced persons and refugees in Iraq increased or decreased   If it has not decreased  what does that mean for the effectiveness of the increase in troops which was supposed to provide the space for political reconciliation  How many segregated enclaves have been established in Iraqi neighborhoods and cities as a result of sectarian cleansing  Who provides local security in these segregated enclaves   Have any of these enclaves become de facto sanctuaries for outlaws and extremist groups or networks     13   Why has intra sectarian violence continued to worsen in the southern provinces of Iraq and in Basra specifically despite the increase of U S forces in Iraq since January 2007    What is the assessment of the provincial governments in southern Iraq and their capabilities to address intra sectarian violence      14   Will the strategic capabilities and ability to respond to other contingencies outside of Iraq by the U S  military be reduced if current troop levels in Iraq are sustained throughout 2008      15   General Petraeus recently said that There are limits to what our military can provide  so  my recommendations have to be informed by  not driven by  but they have to be informed by the strain we have put on our military services  How much longer can the U S  sustain the current troop levels in Iraq given deployment policies and the shrinking pool of ready to deploy units available past April 2008   How many troops are scheduled to redeploy from Iraq in 2008 based on plans to sustain current troop levels   If no action is taken to reduce current troop levels and they are sustained beyond April 2008  what will be the impact on the 15 months deployed 12 month dwell policy   Would this policy still remain in effect   If the current troop levels in Iraq are sustained past April 2008 how many units and personnel serving in Iraq will have their 15 month deployment tours extended   If tours are not extended  how many additional National Guard units and Reserve personnel will be activated for deployment to fill the shortage of unavailable Active ready to deploy units   Of these personnel required to fill gaps how many will violate stated dwell time policies     16   How much will readiness in the Army and Marines suffer if the current troop levels are sustained beyond April 2008   What impact will sustaining the current troop levels past April 2008 have on operational readiness rates for Army and Marine equipment   What is the projected cost to repair and re set equipment   What is the length of time required to restore equipment to fully viable operational readiness rates    17   On May 31  2007  U S  Ambassador to Iraq Ryan C  Crocker sent Secretary of State Rice a diplomatic cable detailing diplomatic staff shortages in the U S  Embassy of Iraq   What is the current state of Department of Defense Department of State coordination in Iraq   Has Ambassador Crockers May request for more diplomatic officers and specialists to be deployed to Iraq been filled     18   On the eve of Operation Iraqi Freedom March 19  2003  you stated that American and Coalition forces would disarm Iraq  free its people  defend the world from grave danger  and undermine Saddam Husseins ability to wage war   On January 23  2007  during the State of the Union Address  you admitted that This is not the fight we entered in Iraq   Does the Administration agree that the nature and mission of the fight that our forces are engaged in now in Iraq in 2007 is fundamentally different than the conflict that our armed forces entered in 2003      19  The importance of Congressional oversight on Iraq policy formulations was recently highlighted in an exchange of letters I had with Secretary of Defense Gates and the Department of Defense   In fact  Secretary Gates affirmed his belief that congressional oversight is a fundamental element of our system of government   In regards to the Iraq debate  I should further note to you that Secretary Gates expressed his views that this debate has been constructive  appropriate  and necessary   Does the Administration agree that Congressional oversight plays an important role in developing policy towards Iraq   Can you clarify the importance of Congress in overseeing Iraq policy    20  Will you provide assurances to Congress and the American people that the Administration is currently planning for contingencies regarding the redeployment of U S  forces out of Iraq    I trust that these issues will be addressed in the September 15 report on Iraq being prepared by the White House as well as the testimony of General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker      Thank you for your consideration    Sincerely yours     Hillary Rodham Clinton   CC   The Honorable Robert Gates  The Honorable Condoleezza Rice  The Honorable Stephen Hadley  Lt  General Douglas Lute  General David Petraeus  Ambassador Ryan Crocker  General Peter Pace
