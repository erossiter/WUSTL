                 Markey  Clinton  Nuclear Regulatory Commission Abdicates Responsibility for Dirty Bomb Security

                Washington  DC   Representative Edward Markey  MA  and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today again called on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  to tighten controls on nuclear materials that could be used to create a dirty bomb  especially in light of recent reports that Al Qaeda had published a  how to make a dirty bomb guide  online   According to the March 2  2006 edition of Global Issues Report   the militant Islamic online forum AlGhorabaa net  a site commonly used by Al Qaeda and Iraqi insurgents  recently circulated Arabic language instructions on how to make a radium dirty bomb   The article reportedly includes photos and detailed directions in order to  make the experiment easy and available for you  my brother the mujahid  as they say  in the kitchen            The NRC is on another planet if it thinks the issue of tracking dirty bomb material is a public health issue  not an issue of preventing a terrorist from deploying and detonating a weapon in the war on terror   said Rep  Markey   We wouldn t ask each state to take primary responsibility for overseeing loose nuclear weapons  yet the NRC is proposing that much of the federal responsibility over loose nuclear material be imposed on state environmental and health inspectors            It is outrageous that the NRC would abdicate its responsibility to track dirty bomb components that we know terrorists would like to get their hands on  The threat of a dirty bomb is a security risk  This is just one more example of failure to ensure our homeland security   New York remains a top threat of terrorist attack and a dirty bomb attack would wreak economic havoc in addition to the risk to human life and health posed by the blast and radiation   In the post 9 11 world  it is unacceptable that the NRC would abdicate its responsibility to track nuclear materials   We need national tracking of nuclear materials that could be used to make a dirty bomb to make sure they don t fall into the wrong hands   said Senator Clinton          Markey and Clinton secured passage of an amendment to the Energy Bill that required a cradle to grave  national tracking system for materials that could be used to make a dirty bomb in order to reduce the risk that terrorists could obtain these materials   The legislation also required the NRC to regulate radium for the first time  However  the NRC has made the short sighted and ill considered decision that controlling these materials is not a security issue and should not be a federal responsibility   Instead  they have deemed this a public health and safety issue and pushed responsibility for implementing the tracking system to the States  effectively eliminating the ability of the NRC to enforce compliance            In a letter to the Chairman of the NRC on June 22  2006  Markey and Clinton called on the NRC to abide by the stricter standard set by the law and make controlling these nuclear materials the federal security priority this threat requires    See more   here   On August 1  2006  the NRC sent its response  which indicated that               States representing about 29  of all radioactive sources to be covered by the tracking system opposed  CA  FL  IL  MA  NY  and States representing about 17  of all radioactive sources to be covered by the tracking system were neutral about  AL  GA  LA  MS  NM  NC  RI  TN  UT  WI  the NRC s move to shift responsibility for implementing and enforcing the tracking system requirements to the States   The NRC will also implement the tracking system in an additional 16 States representing about 20  of all radioactive sources to be covered by the tracking system  These States do not have Agreements with the NRC that would enable them to implement the tracking system            The NRC confirmed that if the rule proceeds using the public health and safety basis  individual States would be expected to oversee and enforce their own implementation of the tracking system  It also confirmed that this would save the Commission money   while shifting these costs to the States           Under the current proposal  if a radiation source is shipped from one State to another  the recipient State would not be notified that it now had an additional source to track              10 States do not currently have 24 7 capability to access tracking source database information
