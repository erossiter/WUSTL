September 23  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on House Passage of Amendment to Suspend Implementation of Head Start National Reporting System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I am delighted that today the House unanimously passed an amendment by Representative Ron Kind  WI  to suspend implementation of the National Reporting System  NRS  until the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  conducts an assessment and provides guidance for improving the evaluation tool  For more than two years  I have voiced concerns that the NRS was not ready to be taken to scale  The passage of this amendment confirms that Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have taken these concerns seriously          During consideration of the Head Start reauthorization in the HELP Committee on October 29  2003  I  along with my colleague Senator Jeff Bingaman  D NM   offered an amendment to make sure the NRS remained a pilot program until it has been reviewed by the NAS   Numerous researchers and experts on child development  including the Government Accountability Office  have called into question the validity and reliability of the testing program  particularly for children from non English speaking homes  For example  the first version of the NRS proposed by the Bush Administration  asked three and four year old children from the inner city to identify a  swamp  even though all experts agreed  a swamp was not likely to part of their experience           I am concerned that if the test is taken to scale before it is ready  the results will not be meaningful and the Department of Health and Human Services will draw inappropriate conclusions and make funding decisions based on them  Today  the Kind amendment took an important step towards preventing such a disadvantageous outcome          It is very important that Head Start programs be evaluated and held to high standards  and that is why I strongly support the in depth FACES survey of all Head Start programs   But before we add another layer to the evaluation system  we must be sure that it is well designed  aligned with appropriate and culturally sensitive standards  and rigorously tested to ensure reliability and validity              The goal of Head Start is to improve children s chances at entering school ready to learn  I am so pleased that the House sent a strong message that the Bush Administration s approach so far has been inadequately researched and ultimately not in the best interest of children   And I will work hard to ensure that the Senate arrives at the same outcome
