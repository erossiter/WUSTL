March 6  2007 Administration s Top 9 11 Health Official s Testimony Draws Concern from NY Area Delegation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Reps  Maloney and Fossella  Sens  Clinton and Schumer  Along with Reps  Towns  Nadler and Shays  Demand Answers About Promised Federal Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC   Following a congressional hearing on the 9 11 health crisis at which the Bush Administration s top 9 11 health official gave few definitive answers  members of the New York area congressional delegation are demanding more information  Reps  Carolyn Maloney  D NY  and Vito Fossella  R NY   Sens  Charles Schumer  D NY  and Hillary Clinton  D NY   along with Reps  Edolphus Towns  D NY   Jerrold Nadler  D NY  and Christopher Shays  R CT   had expected a federal plan on 9 11 health funding by the end of February  and today they are asking for an update          The letter was spurred by Dr  John Agwunobi s appearance before a House Oversight and Government Reform subcommittee chaired by Rep  Towns  The high ranking Department of Health and Human Services official  who has been put in charge of the Administration s 9 11 health response  could not provide answers about the federal World Trade Center task force s funding recommendations  Administration officials previously said the recommendations would be completed by the end of February           Agwunobi also stated that the recommendations  when ready  would not be available for Congressional or public review and that they would not consider the health needs of the area residents  office workers and school children who also inhaled the toxic air near Ground Zero          In their letter  the Members also expressed concern about a potential HHS plan to replace funding for the current Centers of Excellence and coordinated data center with a new plan likely to be less effective           We thought we were seeing a new attitude from the Administration  which would include a federal plan to provide monitoring and treatment for all responders  residents and area workers  Instead it s the same old  do nothing  attitude   said Rep  Maloney   We need a comprehensive 9 11 health plan now           Rep  Fossella said   We are calling on the federal government to finalize a plan to monitor and treat all those who are sick or injured as a result of the terror attacks  We need a plan of action to ensure that those who need medical monitoring and care have access to it                                                                     This is only the latest chapter in this Administration s long history of negligence when it comes to providing assistance to the thousands of first responders and residents affected by 9 11   said Senator Schumer   Merely paying lip service to these heroes is not a plan  it is a disgrace  and I hope this Administration understands that this problem is not disappearing anytime soon  We will keep fighting until these heroes receive the treatment and monitoring they need                           We finally got the Administration to agree that this is a critical issue impacting thousands of people but their subsequent ambivalence and lack of information has been very concerning and I certainly hope that their earlier commitments will not prove hollow  After all these years of fighting to secure the necessary funding and support for post 9 11 healthcare  we simply cannot reinvent the wheel or take a piecemeal approach   We need clear answers on how the Administration intends to proceed and the assurance that it does not intend to cut funding for existing programs or exclude non responders from its needs assessment   Senator Clinton said           I find it unconscionable that this Administration has failed to address the health concerns of the workers  residents and first responders who inhaled those toxins released in the air in the aftermath of the 9 11 attack  The testimony of Dr  John Agwunobi shows that they not only lack a health plan but also a conscience   said Rep  Towns           The 9 11 health crisis was caused  in part  by the negligence and misdeeds of the federal government itself   said Rep  Nadler   It is outrageous that more than five years later  this Administration has still failed to make any substantial progress on providing for the long term and comprehensive screening  testing  monitoring  treatment and research of all 9 11 affected individuals   wherever in the nation they may live   and in a way that is not subject to the vagaries of the politicized annual budgeting process           Rep  Shays said   It appears the public health approach to lingering environmental hazards from 9 11 is still unfocused and halting   The first responders who came to the scene on that day did not go to work  they went to war  They need and deserve effective care and they  regretfully  have not yet gotten it   It s time for a comprehensive plan to monitor and treat them           In January  the Administration notified Congress that it would include  25 million for 9 11 health treatment in the president s FY08 budget  marking the first time any treatment money would be included in the regular budget
