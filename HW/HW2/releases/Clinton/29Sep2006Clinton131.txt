September 29  2006 Waxman  Schumer  Clinton Introduce   Access to Life Saving Medicines Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          To Create a New Pathway for Affordable Versions of Biotech Drugs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    Today Rep  Henry A  Waxman  Sen  Charles E  Schumer  and Sen  Hillary Rodham Clinton introduced the   Access to Life Saving Medicine Act     which will establish a process through which the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  will be able to approve lower cost copies of biotech drugs  also known as biologics or biopharmaceuticals   Biotech drugs  which are produced from living cell cultures rather than synthesized chemically  are among the fastest growing and most expensive components of the nation  s drug bill   Currently there is no statutory pathway for biotech drugs  even after all patents have expired   As a result  the manufacturers of biotech drugs can charge monopoly prices  indefinitely            Generic versions of brand name drugs have long been an essential way for patients to get the medicine they need at a price they can afford     said Rep  Waxman     This bill will use competition to make biological drugs    which are often prohibitively expensive    available to those who suffer from diseases like cancer  diabetes  and AIDS               Biologics treat some of the most devastating diseases around and no one should be denied access to them because of they  re too expensive     Sen  Schumer said     Generic biologics can be a safe and affordable alternative to high priced brand name biologics   Our legislation will allow all Americans to take advantage of these drugs by enabling competition in the market to lower the price and ending permanent monopolies over biologic products   It is high time for these vital treatments to become more affordable and our legislation is just what the doctor ordered                I am pleased to be leading an effort that will have dramatic impact in stemming the rising costs of prescription drugs and the squeeze they put on America  s employers as they try to provide health insurance to their employees   This legislation will provide a critical and necessary pathway for approval of generic versions of biologic prescription drugs  which are among the most expensive medications   Today  Iressa  a biologic used in lung cancer treatment costs  2 000 per month and Remicade for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders costs more than  35 000 per year    Bringing generic versions of these prescription medicines to market will offer patients  employers  and the federal government dramatic cost savings   Achieving this goal is a top priority for me and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get it done     said Sen  Clinton          Biotech drugs can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year  imposing financial burdens on patients  employers  insurers  and federal and state governments   The   Access to Life Saving Drug Act    will authorize FDA to approve abbreviated applications for biological products that are   comparable    to previously approved brand name biological products  without unnecessarily repeating expensive clinical trials            This bill comes in response to years of recognition of the need for a new statutory pathway for approval of generic versions of biotech drugs   These products are not subject to the 1984 law that first authorized FDA to approve generic drugs   The EMEA  which is Europe  s equivalent of the FDA  has had a legal framework in place for approval of   biosimilars    since 2004   In letters received today  both the AARP and the Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market    composed of employers  health plans  generic drug companies  pharmacy benefit managers  and pharmacists    agree that legislation creating a pathway for approval of generic biologics is critically important to assure access to more affordable drugs          Demonstrating that a generic version of a biotech drug is the same as the brand name product raises more complicated scientific issues than for traditional drugs   The bill therefore establishes a rigorous  case by case scientific process for approving these products to make sure they are as safe and as effective as their brand name counterparts   Recent approvals by FDA of similar products  like Omnitrope  a human growth hormone drug approved on the basis of abbreviated tests   show that this approach is scientifically feasible          The bill has been endorsed by the Consumer  s Union  the Consumer Federation  the AFL CIO  and the Generic Pharmaceuticals Association          For more information  including a detailed summary of the bill and the bill text  please visit www waxman house gov
