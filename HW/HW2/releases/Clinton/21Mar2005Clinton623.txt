             Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced the launch of the New York Partnership for a Green Afghanistan  an initiative to replant trees to revitalize Afghanistan s orchards  nurseries  woodlots and greenbelts   The people to people tree planting program is designed to help Afghanistan regain its historic position as the  orchard of Central Asia  and support Afghans as they rebuild their orchard  vineyard and forestry businesses        The announcement was made in conjunction with a tree planting ceremony that took place in Kabul  Afghanistan earlier today    The ceremony  which was attended by President Hamid Karzai  marked the beginning of a major tree planting campaign in the country        The group is organized under the auspices of the Global Partnership for Afghanistan  GFPA   founded soon after 9 11 by New Yorkers and Afghan Americans in recognition of the tragedies suffered by both countries  To lead the project launch  the Global Partnership for Afghanistan is developing family owned orchards  nurseries and woodlot businesses encompassing an initial 70 000 trees  Afghan farmers will begin planting today following the completion of demonstration orchards and nurseries last year         The Partnership will include private citizens and organizations    from non profits and corporations to educational institutions across the state and beyond    to support Afghanistan  s economic and environmental development        In making the announcement today  Senator Clinton confirmed that The State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry  SUNY ESF   Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences  American Forests and International Paper had all signed on as initial partners in this important effort        As part of the Partnership  the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry  SUNY ESF  will immediately reach out to Kabul University to support a university to university exchange for forestry faculty and students  Additionally  SUNY ESF has donated 10 000 willows that can be used as a woody crop for fuel and bio energy  The Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences will contribute expertise in the areas of fruit breeding  production and disease and insect management  vital to the revitalization of Afghan fruit farms   American Forests  a nonprofit conservation organization  is seeking support from corporate and individual sponsors for this critical effort         Senator Clinton also announced the creation of a dedicated fund coordinated by GPFA  a NY based nonprofit organization  and urged supporters to send contributions for spring tree planting          After more than a quarter century of war  nearly 28 million Afghans are struggling to rebuild their livelihoods and communities in the face of destroyed homes  roads and infrastructure  a devastated natural environment and a shattered economy     said Senator Clinton  who recently returned from Afghanistan    New Yorkers want to support this struggling democracy  The New York Partnership for a Green Afghanistan is an important step toward helping Afghans regain self sufficiency  rebuild a viable economy and achieve political stability             Known as the orchard of Central Asia in the 1980s  the country was recognized throughout the region for its harvest and export of quality fruits   Today  Afghanistan has lost the large majority of its orchards and vineyards    Once a net agricultural exporter  the country is now a net importer  This effort is another step in helping revitalize the country from the ground up     said Senator Clinton           I am so pleased that we have brought so many New Yorkers together to help Afghanistan    and this is just the beginning  New York  s farmers  growers and research institutions are world class  They have so much to contribute to this campaign through their knowledge of forestry and their growing and research techniques     Senator Clinton said    I am so pleased that they can bring this expertise to not only help deliver food  income and a range of vital environmental benefits to the people of Afghanistan  but to help restore lives and livelihoods              I have personally witnessed the generosity of the American people as I revisit the Afghan countryside     said GPFA Co chair Professor M  Ishaq Nadiri    With US support  Afghanistan is rebuilding roads  infrastructure and security  Now we need to help Afghans restore livelihoods   Acres of scorched earth stand and dried fields stand where Afghans once cultivated flourishing orchards and vineyards  and the country struggles today to feed its population      Professor Nadiri serves as senior economic advisor to President Karzai in Kabul and is the Jay Gould Professor of Economics at New York University          The leadership of Senator Clinton in launching this people to people initiative will provide lasting benefits to Afghanistan whose people so urgently need the creativity  expertise and financial resources that America can deliver     said Prof  Nadiri    Through the Global Partnership  s work  we know first hand how Afghans deeply value our concrete assistance  No one better embodies this spirit than Senator Hillary Clinton in launching this effort
