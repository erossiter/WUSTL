July 24  2007 Senator Clinton Urges Department of Veterans Affairs to Reconsider Transfer of Key Services Out of Montrose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Describes Potential Transfer of Domiciliary Services as  A Serious Disservice to Hudson Valley Veterans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   In a statement provided to the Montrose and Castle Point VA Local Advisory Panel  LAP  meeting today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton strongly urged the Department of Veterans Affairs to reconsider moving the domiciliary services currently provided at the Montrose VA Hospital to the Castle Point facility  Two of the options discussed this April before the LAP as part of the VAs ongoing Capital Asset for Realignment Enhanced Services  CARES  process recommended that the services be transferred     At this critical time in our nations history when we are asking so much of our troops overseas  we should be setting an example by providing our veterans with the highest possible quality of care  Instead the VA seems intent on transferring  consolidating and hindering access to vital services without fully considering the welfare of those veterans who are most directly affected  Senator Clinton said      Senator Clinton has long been a vocal critic of the CARES initiative and has spoken out against the proposed changes to the Montrose facility on a number of occasions  In her statement today  Senator Clinton described the VAs May 2004 decision to transfer all inpatient psychiatric and nursing home services from Montrose to Castle Point as ill considered  as it did not take into account strategic plans for mental health and long term care  Senator Clinton has also consistently underscored the importance of a transparent decision making process that emphasizes and fully accounts for the views of the local veterans who rely on the services provided at both facilities   See   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 246326    A copy of Senator Clintons statement to the Montrose and Castle Point VA LAP is attached      Distinguished members of the panel  I appreciate the opportunity to communicate my thoughts and concerns to you regarding the impact of the VA Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  process on the facilities located in Montrose and Castle Point   As I have explained in testimony to the first three Local Advisory Panel  LAP  meetings  I strongly oppose the ill considered decision made in May 2004 to transfer all inpatient psychiatric and nursing home services from Montrose to Castle Point   I am also deeply concerned that two of the proposed options discussed before this panel in April would result in moving domiciliary services currently located at Montrose to Castle Point    The May 2004 decision to move inpatient psychiatric and nursing home services away from Montrose was unfortunately made without the support of adequate strategic plans for mental health and long term care  and without sufficient dialogue with the local veterans who will be most directly affected by such a change   Given this experience  it is critical that the recommendations that move forward to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs next month fully account for the views of our veterans and the local community   As these final recommendations are put together  it is imperative that we not lose sight of the ultimate objective   the efficient delivery of high quality health care to our veterans   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide them with the best health care possible   Any final decision that falls short of this goal would be a serious disservice to Hudson Valley veterans    I believe that identifying the best way to deliver high quality health care requires greater transparency and a more open dialogue with the veterans who rely so much on the services provided at Montrose and Castle Point   Engaging openly with local veterans  and taking their views fully into account when making recommendations to the VA Secretary  will only help  not hinder  the VA to better identify the strengths and weaknesses of the various options under consideration   The CARES decision to remove inpatient psychiatric and nursing home services from Montrose regrettably did not take the input of area veterans into account   As recommendations for the future of the Montrose and Castle Point VA facilities move forward to the Secretary  this mistake must not be repeated    With U S  troops serving bravely in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world  now is the time to reaffirm the pact we have made as a nation with our veterans  that those who serve have access to quality health care at VA facilities   Let us continue to work hard and do more to live up to that commitment to our veterans in the Hudson Valley  throughout New York  and across the country
