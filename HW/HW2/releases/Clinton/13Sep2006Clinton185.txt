                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Underscores Need to Expand Monitoring and Treatment for First Responders  Volunteers  Residents and Others Click here for video of Senator Clinton s remarks on the Senate floor             Washington  DC    Emphasizing the need to expand medical and mental health monitoring and treatment of those whose health has been affected by 9 11  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today unveiled a new proposal to provide  1 9 billion in medical and mental health monitoring and treatment grants  available from 2007 2011  to firefighters  police officers  EMTs  paramedics  building and construction trades workers  volunteers  residents  and others whose health was directly impacted at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills   This funding would be administered through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and would expand access to health monitoring and health care to all of those who served  lived and worked in the area in the aftermath of 9 11   Senator Clinton announced her proposal in remarks on the floor of the Senate           I believe that we have a moral obligation as a nation to take care of those who took care of us  as a way of demonstrating our solidarity and commitment to them and honoring their resilience and courage in the face of the terrorist attacks   said Senator Clinton          Senator Clinton sounded the alarm soon after 9 11 that those exposed to the toxic air at and around Ground Zero would suffer health effects from their exposure and would need help in the days  months and years to come   She led efforts to secure  12 million in December 2001 to establish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program run by Mt  Sinai  the first program designed to track and monitor the health of 9 11 responders   Senator Clinton worked with her colleagues to secure an additional  90 million to expand the number of workers and volunteers eligible  and successfully helped to restore  125 million in additional funding for long term medical and mental health monitoring and treatment and workers compensation benefits          Senator Clinton emphasized that a report released this month by Mt  Sinai shows conclusively that thousands of first responders  workers  volunteers  residents and others suffered mental and medical health problems as a direct result of 9 11   Senator Clinton has underscored that this report confirms the need to expand access to health monitoring and treatment to cover all of those whose health was affected by 9 11            The following is the text of Senator Clinton s remarks on the Senate floor       Remarks by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Senate Floor on New Proposal to Address 9 11 Health Effects      This amendment goes to the heart of our obligations to one another with respect to homeland security   It arises out of the attacks of 9 11  the extraordinary physical damage that has been done to thousands and thousands of New Yorkers and other Americans because they responded to that disaster  because they worked in the area of Ground Zero  because they lived or volunteered there          Each of us is marked in our own way by the events of five years ago  I need not recount them  We have just gone through a very painful anniversary of those attacks  My hope is that we would not mark this fifth year anniversary merely by wreath layings and speeches and solemn readings of the names of the victims  but that it would serve as a reminder of our unfinished business and a call to action on behalf of the service and sacrifice of first responders  workers and volunteers who participated in the rescue and recovery at Ground Zero          I have worked the past five years to honor the memories of those who died  to take care of their families and to help rebuild New York   I have fought for the funding that has generously been offered by the American people to support the economic recovery of downtown New York  building new buildings  helping to support small businesses  creating new transportation infrastructure to replace that which was obliterated  And I have worked to secure funding  starting in the fall of 2001  to monitor those who were affected by the exposure to the toxic gases and substances in the air as a result of the attacks and the implosion of the buildings          I believe that we have a moral obligation as a nation to take care of those who both took care of us and who attempted to return to their ordinary lives as a way of demonstrating solidarity and commitment  resilience and courage in the face of the terrorist attacks          There s much we have to do  which is why we are debating this bill about port security  but there is so much more than port security   The Democrats offered a comprehensive amendment to this bill that contained the recommendations of many experts  including the 9 11 Commission  Sadly  it was unsuccessful  but that doesn t mean it wasn t merited and that we cannot rest until we have a comprehensive  well funded strategy to deal with the threats we face   But Mr  President  I rise today to talk about a very specific issue          The toll of that fateful day goes beyond the families and friends and colleagues  the brave responders who saved 25 000 people in the greatest rescue mission in the history of the world   Their lives will always stand in our memory and in honor   But thousands of others rushed into that burning inferno   Thousands of others were there when that enormous  devastating cloud of death and destruction covered much of Lower Manhattan  crossed the river to Brooklyn  crossed the river to New Jersey          We have been working to understand the health implications for the people who breathed that air  And that s why I ve fought to get money for a monitoring and screening program that was established both at the fire department to take care of our firefighters and also at one of our great hospitals  Mt  Sinai  to figure out what happened to everybody else          The work that commenced from the moment the first plane hit was hazardous and difficult  And for as long as nine months we had firefighters and police officers  trade and construction workers  other workers  volunteers  residents    we had probably at least 40 000 people coming and going and staying on that site  They worked and lived amidst the dust and the fog and the smog  a toxic mix of debris  smoke and chemicals          I first visited the site about 24 hours after the attacks  I was within blocks of the epicenter of the attack  and I could not see anything  but I could smell it  I could taste it  I could literally feel it  And as I watched that curtain of darkness part and the firefighters walking out covered in black soot  dragging their fire axes  barely able to stand after being on duty for probably 24 hours  I had the first inkling that the damaging effects of 9 11 would last far beyond the actual attack          Now unfortunately our government officials in charge of making sure health and working conditions did not negatively impact our first responders sent mixed signals at best  I would go further  They misled people  They said the air was safe  They made no effort to reach out and share the dangers that people knew were in this air   And it wasn t only people from New York who responded  It was people from all over the country          My colleague  Senator Voinovich from Ohio and I  have a bill that would set up a system for the president to carry out a program for the monitoring of the health and safety of first responders that are exposed to harmful substances as a result of the disaster rather than reacting on an ad hoc basis as we ve had to do in the wake of 9 11          Because of what I witnessed firsthand and what people started to tell me          You know  the trademark World Trade Center cough appeared within days  people had trouble breathing  had trouble swallowing  they were coughing  That s why I was so insistent upon getting  12 million to establish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program at Mt  Sinai   We quickly realized they would need a lot more work because thousands and thousands of people were signing up and coming   So we secured an additional  90 million  and we expanded the number of workers and volunteers  and that was in addition to what we did for the fire department  which ran its own program          Well  last week Mt  Sinai released a report that confirmed our worst fears   It confirmed an earlier report of the New York City fire department study   Tens of thousands of firefighters and all the others who were there were not only exposed but were suffering from significant medical and mental health problems   We are seeing young men and women in the prime of their lives who were in excellent physical health experiencing asthma  bronchitis  persistent sinus sites  laryngitis   They are suffering from serious diseases  reactive airway disease  their lungs are collapsing  their livers are polluted   In fact  we are now seeing the first deaths          It is not enough to say we stand with the brave men and women who responded when we needed them   We have to do more          We appropriated  125 million and after a year and a half of struggle  money that was meant to go for the workers  comp system because so many of these people cannot work anymore  they are on disability  they are forced into retirement  and so many of them  about 40  of them  were screened at Mt  Sinai had no insurance so they can t even get the treatment which they now know they need  We have met with the Secretary of Health and Human Services who has promised to get the money released to begin treating these brave men and women  We have worked with Dr  John Howard  the Director of NIOSH  who has documented so many of the diseases and chronic conditions that we ve seen  But we have a long way to go  and we need to start now          I can t give you an exact amount of money that it will take to take care of these thousands of people   But we know it will be a lot more than the  75 million we re waiting to be released on October 1  That s why this amendment would authorize  1 9 million in grants to begin the process of setting up the system  and over the next five years implementing a system to take care of thousands of people who are getting sick and who are dying          We had a bipartisan  bicameral hearing in New York City last week  One of the witnesses  Steve Centore  who was a federal employee  sat before us  his skin yellowed from the diseasing of his liver  his memory shot  his lungs collapsing and described in detail how his government has let him down and left him behind  If we don t take care of these people now and start putting up a system that we can have in place for the next several years  we are going to betray a fundamental responsibility to those whom we salute whenever it is convenient  whenever it is political   But enough with that   They don t want our speeches  They don t want our flowery rhetoric   They want our help          My amendment uses rough estimates of about  5 800 per individual per year to provide for the continuing monitoring  but more importantly  the treatment of these individuals  These are the rough estimates  the best we have right now from the fire department and Mt  Sinai  but we already know that there are people on lung transplant lists who were on that pile   We already know that people who have been disabled are unable to work and therefore have no insurance any longer   We know that there are those who have died because of these exposures          Now  did everybody get sick   No  Will everybody who got sick die          No   Much of it depends upon where you were  what you were exposed to  what the intensity and the length of the exposure was   Some of it also depends on your predisposition  your susceptibility  your genetic make up          But take the case of Detective James Zadroga  a 34 year old detective who joined the NYPD in 1992   He did not smoke  He had no known history of asthma   He was an exemplary NYPD detective  the kind of detective they make TV shows about   Someone with a shelf full of commendations who put himself in harms way time and time again to protect the people of the City of New York   Spend time with his father Joseph  a retired police chief   You ll hear about the 450 hours that this decorated detective spent working on recovery efforts on the pile at Ground Zero in 2001   Filled his lungs with fiberglass  with pulverized concrete  with other toxic chemicals that destroyed his lungs   The stress and strain of his deteriorating physical condition was followed by the death of his wife  leaving him responsible for his two year old daughter  He died on the floor of his bedroom with his little girl trying to wake him up          I know this is an authorization bill and I know that it doesn t appropriate money but it does something equally important  it sets a marker  It makes a statement  It takes all of the words and claims to concern and puts them into action  It says that we re not only with you in word and deed but we will not abandon you in your time of need          If as we hear September 11 was a day that changed our nation forever  and it s one that Americans will always remember  then let us not lose sight of its lessons  Let us finally heed the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission by fully implementing them   Let us do everything we can to make our bridges  our tunnels  our transit systems  our rail lines  our entire infrastructure as safe as possible   But otherwise we re going to have a lot of autopsy reports like we had for James Zadroga and we re going to read about the death and disability of thousands and thousands of our bravest  most courageous men and women           And we re going to see construction workers who before 9 11 could lift three times their body weight in steel and do whatever was necessary to construct those sky scrapers bent over in pain unable to breathe and sleep   I don t think that s what we want as our legacy as a nation coming out of 9 11          The country has been very supportive of New York  and I am extremely grateful  but we were on the end of the spear when it came to absorbing the attack and reacting  And now we have to continue to keep faith with those who did our country proud in the hours  days  weeks and months following that horrific attack on our nation          Mr  President  I would ask for the consideration of this amendment to honor those who honored us and to create a system to make sure that they do not go without care  that they get the treatment they need  that their life can be saved and prolonged  that we don t lose any more 34 year old detectives  who in the autopsy report  the pathologist said   it is felt with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the cause of death in this case was directly related to the 9 11 incident   Let s not have any more victims of the terrorists  Let s not let Bin Laden and Al Qaeda claim any more Americans who died as a result of their evil attack on us  Let s band together and support those who need us in their hour  And I hope  Mr  president  that we can make such a statement with this amendment today
