January 23  2007 A State of the Union Message on 9 11 Health  Sick Responders in Washington to Watch President  s Speech  Push for Federal Aid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     NY Reps  Maloney  Fossella  Hinchey and Nadler  Sens  Schumer and Clinton     Join Call for Federal Program as Health Money Begins to Dry Up Washington  DC    As the first and only dose of federal 9 11 health treatment money is on the verge of running out  sick 9 11 responders and family members traveled to Washington today to watch the president  s State of the Union Address and join with lawmakers in calling for serious federal assistance for the responders  residents and workers affected by the toxic air at Ground Zero  The responders and lawmakers  who for years have called for a better federal response to the 9 11 health effects  are concerned not only that funds are running dry but also that the administration has yet to develop a comprehensive plan to address the crisis          The responders and family members received their tickets to the House Gallery for the State of the Union address from Members of the New York delegation  In speaking before the State of the Union  the responders were joined by Reps  Carolyn Maloney  D NY   Vito Fossella  R NY   Maurice Hinchey  D NY  and Jerrold Nadler  as well as Senators Charles Schumer  D NY  and Hillary Clinton  D NY  and Rep  Christopher Murphy  D CT            Representing those made ill by the toxic air at Ground Zero were ironworker John Sferazo  and paramedic Marvin Bethea of the Unsung Heroes Helping Heroes  Joseph Zadroga  father of deceased NYPD detective James Zadroga  lower Manhattan office worker Robert Gulack  Ceasar Borja  Jr   son of retired NYPD officer  Cesar Borja  who is critically ill at Mt  Sinai Hospital in NYC  and FDNY Lt  Martin Fullham          Also appearing with the responders were doctors representing the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program and representatives of the New York State AFL CIO              The 9 11 heroes in the House Gallery tonight will represent the thousands responders  residents and workers who were made sick by the toxic air at Ground Zero and have been desperately looking to their government and their president for help     said Rep  Maloney  co chair of the 9 11 Health Caucus    The only dose of federal treatment funds for 9 11 health effects is running out  and we want the president to commit to a real and ample federal program of assistance  There are heroes dying  and the government has barely lifted a finger  Our goal is to get everyone who was exposed to the toxic air examined and everyone who is sick treated               We have made progress over the last year to begin getting the resources necessary to help our 9 11 heroes     said Rep  Fossella  co chair of the 9 11 Health Caucus    However  we now need a significant investment by the federal government into health monitoring and treatment for those who are sick or injured  In addition  the federal government must develop a comprehensive plan to address the health impacts of 9 11  We continue urging the White House to provide adequate funding in the 2008 budget to help all those who are sick or injured as a result of the terror attacks               The president will raise a lot of issues tonight in his State of the Union address   Among these  I truly hope that he will take the time to recognize the state of these 9 11 responders  health and commit to providing the funds needed to take care of these heroic individuals     Rep  Hinchey said    During one of our nation s darkest moments  these brave men and women selflessly gave their time and energy to help rescue their fellow Americans   Unfortunately  we ve learned that many of them also sacrificed their good health when they breathed in the toxic air at the site of the World Trade Center   The State of the Union will be tarnished unless we act to provide the funds needed to take care of our 9 11 heroes               The Federal  State  and City governments are clearly culpable for recklessly allowing thousands of people to be exposed to environmental toxins in the days following 9 11     said Rep  Nadler     And yet  we are seeing 9 11 victims struggling to pay health care costs with inadequate or no insurance  a horrendous number of worker s compensation claims rejected  and a government still failing to test and clean up apartments  workspaces and schools  which would prevent more people from getting sick               When the President sees New York  s 9 11 workers sitting in the audience during his address  he should remember not only their bravery in the wake of the attacks  but also the health problems they continue to suffer from due to their heroic efforts at Ground Zero     said Senator Schumer    At the very least  the President needs to understand that it  s our country  s moral obligation to ensure that the 2008 budget includes adequate funding for the monitoring and treatment of these workers  Time is running out               Our message to the President is clear  include funding in this year  s budget to monitor and treat those who survived the attacks of 9 11  who breathed that toxic air  who mounted the greatest rescue in the history of the world but did not walk away unharmed   People are still carrying incredible burdens in the aftermath of 9 11    still sacrificing  still suffering  What we secured so far is only a down payment in repaying our debt to those who came to us in our hour of need  I am hopeful the President will heed this call     said Senator Clinton            It defies comprehension that more than five years after the attack the heroes who rushed into the rubble of the World Trade Center still don  t have the care they need     said Rep  Murphy    The federal government has to stop dragging their heels and get these people care   We cannot continue to send a message to our firefighters that their health needs could be neglected once they return from a battle ground               The first responders were heroes on September 11th and they remain heroes today  We must never forget that     said Suzy Ballantyne  Political Director  New York State AFL CIO    The president must recognize these brave men and women with more than just words  but in deed  The administration must provide funding in this budget to ensure that our heroes get the care they so justly deserve             In October  the Department of Health and Human distributed  75 million in 9 11 health funds     40 million of which was for health treatment  Read More  This was the very first federal money spent for treatment of 9 11 health effects          Reps  Maloney and Fossella urged
