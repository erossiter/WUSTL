

                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DCSenators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced Senate approval of the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill  which includes funding for projects on Long Island  including construction at the Francis S  Gabreski Air National Guard Base  and funding for the Long Island Rail Road East Side Access Project  The omnibus bill  which includes 11 appropriations bills  will go before the House for final passage before being sent to the President for signature    I m pleased that the Senate has approved this vital funding for Long Island s infrastructure  criminal justice system and environment  Schumer said  Because of this investment  Long Islanders can look forward to shorter commutes  better equipped police  and cleaner natural environments that will not only strengthen the local economy  but ensure that all Long Islanders enjoy an improved quality of life    The funds included in this bill are a wise investment in Long Island  and will improve our military installations  strengthen local law enforcement  and invest in our communities  and will strengthen New Yorks economy and infrastructure  said Senator Clinton  I am especially happy to see that funding has been included for Gabreski Air National Guard Base  so that the members of the 106th Air Rescue Wing can continue to safely and successfully carry out their missions  Funding for the Long Island Rail Roads East Side Access Project is a huge investment in what will be a key piece of city transportation infrastructure that will save hours on the daily commute from Queens and Long Island  and will hopefully take thousands of cars off the roads    The funding for Gabreski would support the construction of part one of the Pararescue Facility at the Francis S  Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach  NY  In April 2004 as a result of unit reorganization  the 106th Air Rescue Wing more than doubled  Special requirements that could not be accommodated under the old organization were severely strained  Space is required to perform pre mission planning and training so that missions can continue to be successfully executed without endangering crew members during challenging and high risk missions    The  210 7 million in federal funding will go to the Long Island Rail Road East Side Access Project  a joint federal state effort  to link the Long Island Railroad via the 63rd Street Tunnel to Grand Central Station  The project will help tens of thousands of Nassau  Suffolk and Queens commuters save up to three hours on their daily commutes  The project will also free up much needed capacity in Penn Station  take thousands of cars off congested New York roads and help remove 800 tons of pollutants from the air     In addition  East Side Access will significantly reduce the bottleneck on the City s subways and buses between Penn Station and Grand Central Station  particularly the 1 2 3 7 9  A  C  and E subway lines  as well as the shuttle trains between Grand Central and Time Square     The Omnibus Appropriations bill includes funding for the following projects for Long Island     Gabreski Air National Guard Base  Westhampton
