September 14  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Republican Leadership Refusal to Allow Vote on Proposal to Address 9 11 Health Issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    I am deeply disappointed that the Republican Leadership of the Senate has used parliamentary tactics to block a vote on my amendment to the Port Security legislation  I authored an amendment that authorizes grants of  1 9 billion for ailing firefighters  police officers  paramedics  building and construction trades workers  volunteers  residents  office workers and others who inhaled the toxic dust cloud that covered Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn following the collapse of the Twin Towers  We now have scientific evidence from Mt  Sinai that these individuals were exposed to all sorts of chemicals and some of them are dying as a result  In fact  the report stated that nearly 70 percent of the rescue and cleanup workers who were at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills will have breathing and health problems for the rest of their lives  America cried out for those who lost their lives on that day  and these heroes did not hesitate to respond when their country needed them  Now  when their health is deteriorating as a direct result of their efforts in the days  weeks  and months after the September 11  2001 attacks  their country should answer their calls for help  I will urge the Senate to act swiftly to enact this or other legislation designed to monitor and treat individuals and to prevent more casualties from these attacks
