December 12  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on Congressional Leaders to Cut Red Tape Hampering State Family Planning Efforts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Urges Action to Ease Burden on States Providing Family Planning Coverage Through Medicaid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Congressional leaders to relieve administrative burdens on states trying to provide low income women with affordable family planning services by giving states the option to renew or expand those services under Medicaid without a cumbersome and unnecessary renewal process   In a letter to Senators Harry Reid and Max Baucus  Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative John Dingell  Senator Clinton called for the inclusion of the Medicaid State Family Planning Option  which passed the House as part of the Childrens Health and Medicare Protection Act  in any final legislation that addresses Medicare physician payments this year  Twenty five senators joined Senator Clinton in signing the letter    The federal government should make it easier for states such as New York to provide women with affordable family planning services  not harder  said Senator Clinton  Red tape should not hold back pragmatic efforts to help women and reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies    New York is one of twenty six states that have been granted waivers to expand Medicaids family planning coverage to low income women who would not otherwise qualify for Medicaids full insurance program   Unfortunately  the current waiver process is cumbersome and places excessive administrative burdens on the states  The Medicaid State Family Planning Option would make it easier for states to renew existing programs or expand access to family planning services in Medicaid through state plan amendment  without having to go through the difficult waiver renewal process  The plan would also improve access to preventive care and generate cost savings to the state and federal government  The Congressional Budget Office has determined that the Medicaid State Family Planning Option saves  400 million over ten years    In each of the last two Congresses  Senator Clinton has introduced the Unintended Pregnancy Reduction Act  which provides the Medicaid State Family Planning Option  Senator Clinton has been a tireless champion of efforts to expand access to women s health care  ensure all women have access to contraception  and reduce the number of unintended pregnancies  As First Lady  she helped create the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy  which has helped reduce the teen birth rate by nearly a third since the early 1990s  She also worked to prevent restrictions on access to Title X family planning services from becoming law and helped lead the Clinton Administration s successful effort to increase Title X funding    The text of Senator Clintons letter follows       Dear Chairman Baucus  Majority Leader Reid  Speak Pelosi  and Chairman Dingell    As representatives of states with Medicaid family planning waivers  we are writing to urge you to include the Medicaid State Family Planning Option  passed as part of the Childrens Health and Medicare Protection Act  in any final legislation that addresses Medicare physician payments this year   The Medicaid Family Planning State Option would make it easier for states to renew existing programs or expand access to family planning services in Medicaid through state plan amendment  without having to go through the cumbersome and unnecessary waiver renewal process    Since the mid 1990s  26 states have been granted section 1115 waivers to expand Medicaids family planning coverage to low income women who would not otherwise qualify for Medicaids full insurance program   These demonstration projects have been unqualified successes   An evaluation commissioned by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  found that these programs not only met more of the need for subsidized contraceptive care  and made that care more geographically available  but generated substantial cost savings   States as diverse as Alabama  Arkansas  California  Oregon and South Carolina have each been able to save the state and federal government more that  15 million in a single year by helping women avoid unintended pregnancies that would have resulted in Medicaid funded births      Unfortunately  the current waiver process has proven increasingly unworkable   Over the last decade  only seven of the 20 proposals for income based eligibility expansions approved by CMS have been approved within a year of when they were submitted by the state   Six applications took between one and two years for approval  and seven languished for two years or more before finally being approved   Particularly given the well established value of these demonstrations  the current approval and re approval required under federal law wastes critical staff resources  hamstrings states ability to meet changing needs  and limits our efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies and meet reproductive health needs in our states      In addition to relieving administrative burdens on our states and expanding access to important preventive health services  the Medicaid Family Planning State Option saves money   The Congressional Budget Office has determined that the Medicaid State Family Planning Option saves  400 million over ten years  savings that can be used to pay for other important health priorities      Giving states this option will improve access to preventive care  ease administrative burdens  and generate cost savings to the state and federal government   We urge you to relieve the administrative burden on our states by including the House provision giving states the option of expanding family planning services under Medicaid through state plan amendment in any final legislation that addresses Medicare physician payments this year    Sincerely
