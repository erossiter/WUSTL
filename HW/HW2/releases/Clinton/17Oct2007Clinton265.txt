October 17  2007 Clinton  Delauro Introduce Bill to Strengthen America s Child Care Workforce                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  D CT  today joined with child care providers  labor leaders  and advocates to introduce legislation to strengthen Americas child care workforce   The Quality Child Care for America Act invests in quality child care by funding workforce development initiatives and workforce enhancement for child care providers  who all too often lack the training and resources they need to ensure high quality care for our children     When we neglect child care  we are neglecting our children   By failing to provide the resources needed to attract and keep people in the field and improve training  we risk failing children in their formative years  as well as parents who rely on child care to go to work to support their family  said Senator Clinton   The Quality Child Care for America Act will help these children succeed by helping child care providers succeed           The Quality Child Care for America Act is not only about helping parents find peace of mind  the knowledge that their child will be safe and sound in the hours they cannot be with them  and about creating a strong foundation to ensure every child has a fair shot to achieve his or her dreams  but also about helping child care providers receive the benefits they are due  said Congresswoman DeLauro   To make quality childcare available and to make that investment pay off  our nation needs a well trained and educated child care workforce   This is about investing in the future of our country  in our workforce and in our children  With this legislation  Senator Clinton and Congresswoman DeLauro are insisting upon a greater investment in quality child care and the professionals who do this important work  These men and women have committed their lives to providing quality care for our children and families   Its time for our nation to match their commitment   And the way to do that is by passing the Quality Child Care for America Act  said Gerald McEntee  President of the American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees  AFSCME   By seeking a comprehensive solution to the child care crisis  this bill recognizes the critically important contribution child care providers make every day to ensure kids can get the quality early education they need to grow and learn  said Service Employees International Union  SEIU  Secretary Treasurer  Anna Burger  Child care workers  who are almost one hundred percent female  can have a critical impact on the successful development of the children in their care   Yet they are among the lowest paid workers in our society  they often lack health insurance or other benefits  and all too often are forced to hold second jobs  said Nancy Duff Campbell  Co President of the National Womens Law Center   The Quality Child Care for America Act begins to address these serious concerns by providing additional federal resources to states to fund initiatives aimed at supporting the child care workforce and improving child care quality  Strengthening Americas child care workforce is a critical investment in our children and families   Every week  more than 12 million children under six years old are in child care   Approximately half of these are three years old and younger   High quality  developmentally appropriate child care has been shown to increase a childs chances for success in school later in life and although many child care providers in centers and in homes across the country are providing high quality care  too many lack the support needed to improve child care quality   At the same time  too many child care providers cannot afford to stay in the profession  rarely have access to healthcare or benefits and receive little or no training   The lack of affordable  high quality child care not only affects children  it is also an important factor in workers capacity to maintain employment   High turnover remains an issue for the child care field   Thirty five percent of employed child care providers in 2005 were no longer employed the following year  The Quality Child Care for America Act will help address the child care crisis by investing in child care professionals   The bill amends the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act to create a  200 million set aside fund for child care centers and home based providers to improve quality as well as compensation and support for child care professionals   States will be able to distribute these funds to public and private child care centers and home based child centers  with a maximum of 30 percent of funding directed to non center based providers   Funding can be used towards compensation or benefits for child care providers  as well as continuing education and training   Providers will be required to maintain the expenditures put toward child care in the previous fiscal year  but funding provided under the Quality Child Care for America Act will supplement any efforts to increase care quality  The legislation is supported by the National Womens Law Center  the American Federation of State  County and Municipal Employees  AFSCME  and the Service Employees International Union  SEIU
