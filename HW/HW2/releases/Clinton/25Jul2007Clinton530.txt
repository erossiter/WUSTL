July 25  2007 Senator Clinton Announces Bill to Step Up Federal Commitment to Environmental Justice                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Leads First Ever Senate Hearing on Environmental Justice                Washington  DC  Kicking off the first ever Senate hearing on Environmental Justice  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she will introduce legislation to step up the Federal governments efforts to ensure environmental justice   Senator Clinton convened todays hearing as Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committees Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health   Emphasizing that the Bush Administration has turned a blind eye to communities that continue to be disproportionately impacted by exposure to environmental hazards  Senator Clinton called for more accountability at the Environmental Protection Agency and increased support for community based efforts to address environmental concerns    Today  millions live in fear that the air in their neighborhoods is unsafe to breathe  the water unfit to drink  their home an unhealthy place to raise their children   Far too many Americans with lower incomes or from communities of color are confronted with higher levels of pollution  putting their children and families at risk  Its separate  its unequal  and its wrong  said Senator Clinton   We must pressure the Bush Administration and do all we can to once again make fighting this inequity a priority for our nation     Senator Clintons bill will   Minority and low income communities continue to be disproportionately impacted by exposure to environmental hazards   According to a recent report by the United Church of Christ  of the nine million Americans who live in communities with one or more hazardous waste facility  more than five million of them are people of color   In addition  a 2005 Associated Press analysis of EPA data noted that African Americans are 79 percent more likely than white populations to reside in neighborhoods where air pollution levels posed health risks   Hispanic and African American children have lead poisoning rates 1 5 to 2 5 times higher than white children  and about half of the low income housing in our nation is located within a mile of factories that report toxic emissions to the EPA  The Clinton Administration issued an Executive Order in 1994 requiring the Federal Government to take action to address the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on minority and low income populations  with the Environmental Protection Agency in the lead   Recent reports from the Government Accountability Office and the Inspector General of the Environmental Protection Agency have raised serious concerns about EPAs current commitment to environmental justice and the Bush Administration has taken little action to address this problem  Senator Clinton has been a leader in efforts to address environmental health hazards that disproportionately affect low income and minority communities  working to combat child lead poisoning and reduce childhood asthma   She included a provision in the Brownfields law to target funding to communities that are experiencing a higher than normal incidence of diseases  Senator Clinton has introduced the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act to provide critically needed resources to reduce home lead hazards   She will also reintroduce the Family Asthma Act  which will improve our ability to examine the environmental pollutants that are linked to asthma and help improve patient management of diseases  A transcript of Senator Clinton s opening remarks from today s hearing is below     Senator Clinton  Welcome to the Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health Oversight Hearing on EPAs Environmental Justice Programs  I would like to thank all of you for joining us today  and especially those who have traveled from communities in New York  Louisiana  California  Tennessee  South Carolina  many  many places around our country     Community groups from across America  from Alaska to New York  submitted statements about their difficult pursuit of environmental justice  and if there is no objection I would like to include their written statements as testimony in the record of this hearing  And I hear no objection     Todays hearing represents the first Senate hearing in history devoted to environmental justice  One only needs to look at the statements submitted by concerned citizens and community organizations    ranging from the Asian Pacific Environmental Network  to the Farmworker Support Committee  to the Sierra Club  to so many others  to understand the critical importance of this issue to so many of our fellow citizens     These personal stories and community challenges represent a record of injustice  record of children growing up with asthma that keeps them home from school  suffering from lead poisoning that harms their ability to learn and reach their God given potentials  record of families living within steps of toxic waste facilities  neighborhoods where polluted air poses health risks     Im entering these statements into the record because they remind us that this is an issue that touches millions  Today  millions live in fear that the air is unsafe to breathe  water unfit to drink  their home unhealthy to raise their children in  And we know that these are predominantly communities of color and low income populations  Therefore  I think it is imperative that we understand we have a moral duty to act     A 2005 Associated Press analysis of EPA air data found that African Americans were 79 percent more likely than their white counterparts to live in an area where the levels of air pollution posed health risks  About one half of lower income homes in our nation are located within a mile of factories that report toxic emissions to the EPA  Hispanic and African American children have lead poisoning rates that are roughly double that of their white counterparts  This is a particular problem in many parts of my state and in older communities across our country where the housing stock is older and  unfortunately therefore  more prone to produce unacceptable levels of lead in childrens blood  Asthma rates in East Harlem  New York  a predominantly lower income community of color  Hispanic and African American  are among the highest in the nation     I have proposed several pieces of legislation to address these environmental injustices and to help those living with the consequences  When Congress passed the Brownfields Law  I included a provision to target funding to communities with higher incidences of diseases such as cancer  My Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2007 would help to make more than 80 000 homes safe from lead each year  nearly ten times the capacity of current federal efforts  My Family Asthma Act  to strengthen our study of environmental pollution linked to asthma  would help patients better manage the disease  Im proud of my bipartisan work on environmental justice  and proud of the work of the Clinton Administration     In 1994  the Clinton Administration required all federal agencies to make environmental justice part of their mission and created an Interagency Workgroup on Environmental Justice to coordinate justice activities  Throughout the Clinton Administration the EPA worked to develop and carry out the mandate that environmental justice was not just a rallying cry but a real priority of our nation     This is not and should not be a Democratic or Republican priority  In fact  under the first Bush Administration  the EPA released several reports on what was then known as environmental equity  now called environmental justice     Unfortunately  but not surprisingly  this bipartisan priority stops at the steps of the White House under this President  who for six and a half long years has allowed ideology to trump science and evidence and permitted politics to make decisions     The current administration has taken us backwards and it is millions of low income families and citizens of color who pay the price  The EPA has refused to recognize the crystal clear evidence  your income and your skin color is a good indication of how clean your air will be when you take a breath     The EPA has failed to take action on environmental justice and rolled back many of the gains that we made during the 1990s  Documents from the EPA administrators from 2001 and 2005 downplay the disproportionate impact of environmental problems on lower income and minority communities    The Interagency Working Group formed by the executive order is idling  maintaining only programs started during the Clinton Administration  The National Environmental Justice Advisory Committee  which used to meet on at least an annual basis  has not convened for a full public meeting since 2004 according to the EPAs website     The agencys failures were catalogued in a report released earlier this year by the United Church of Christ  This report  called Toxic Wastes and Race at Twenty  states that the environmental justice movement faltered and became invisible at the EPA under the George W  Bush Administration     A 2004 report from the EPAs Office of the Inspector General found the following  EPA has not fully implemented executive order 12898  the order issued by President Clinton  nor consistently integrated environmental justice into its day to day operations     In 2005  the wholly non partisan Government Accountability Office released a report titled  EPA Should Devote More Attention to Environmental Justice When Developing Clean Air Rules  The GAO concluded that the agency has failed to consider environmental justice in making rules that protect families from environmental degradation and pollution     In 2006  the Office of the Inspector General released another report on the EPAs environmental justice record  concluding that EPA senior management had not sufficiently directed program and regional offices to conduct environmental justice reviews    Under the Bush Administration  the EPA has not lived up to its mission to protect health and the environment  Far too many Americans with lower incomes or from communities of color do not have equal access to protections that safeguard health  well being  and the potential of children and families  Its separate  its unequal  and its wrong    As I said at the outset  this hearing is a first  in and of itself  The first Senate hearing devoted exclusively to environmental justice programs  But in my view  it is just a first step     We have a lot more work to do on this issue  as we will explore in todays hearing  But I want to let everyone who is here today  who is watching on the web  who has submitted testimony  I am committed to working with you  along with my Chairwoman Senator Barbara Boxer to restore environmental justice as a priority at EPA    I am announcing two follow up steps to this hearing  First  I will be introducing legislation to address some of the environmental justice concerns we have identified    The legislation will increase federal accountability by making sure the environmental justice working group addresses environmental justice concerns that cross agencies and issues  such as housing and transportation     Second  we want to help build community capacity through a grant program to help communities engage in this kind of local multi agency work  building on a pilot program initiated under the Clinton Administration    Third  we want to provide access to experts by establishing an environmental justice clearinghouse to help connect communities with technical experts who can help them address their environmental justice issues     Finally  I want to announce that I will be holding a Superfund oversight hearing in my subcommittee this fall  This is something that Senator Boxer and I both think is a critical priority     She has been a champion of Superfund cleanup and dealing with these environmental justice issues for as long as she has been in public life  She was the first person who memorably said that when it comes to protecting the health of our children from pollution  we can not think of children as miniature adults  They are much more susceptible to things like asthma  lead poisoning  and so much else     So I am delighted to be able to convene and chair this subcommittee hearing  I especially want to thank my Chairwoman Senator Boxer  because Senator Boxers leadership on this committee is a breath of great fresh air  We are dealing with issues that need to be addressed  and under her leadership we are going to make progress in a bi partisan way dealing with the environmental and health issues confronting Americans
