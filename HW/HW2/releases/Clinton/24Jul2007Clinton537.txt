             Washington  DC  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   and Senator Hillary Clinton  D NY  are asking the Government Accountability Office to determine how a man believed to be infected with extensively drug resistant tuberculosis  XDR TB  was able to slip past government officials and reenter the United States even when health officials knew of his medical condition    The request came in a letter sent July 24  2007  to GAO Comptroller General David Walker  asking the agency to review and assess the coordination and response of the federal government to a May incident in which Andrew Speaker  infected with a rare and difficult to treat form of TB  was permitted to enter the United States from Canada     The senators said the incident exposed a disturbing picture of the federal governments ability to respond to a known public health incident and protect our homeland security    Mr  Speakers ability to cross our borders raises questions not only about events that transpired at that inland port but in the federal governments overall approach to safeguarding our nation from public health threats before they reach our borders    We should never again have a situation where delays and failures in communication between the federal government  other domestic public heath officials  and relevant commercial entities lead to needless exposure and risk  We need to assure the American people that our government can respond in a coordinated manner to these types of public health incidents  This incident should serve as a wake up call that we need to establish and exercise effective plans to deal with the travel of known public health threats    The senators called on GAO to review and describe the sequence of events surrounding the incident and establish a timeline  assess what systems and processes were in place to respond to the health threat  and determine the extent to which federal agencies and other key organizations shared important information and followed established protocols     The full text of the letter is below    July 24  2007   The Honorable David Walker  Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548   Dear Mr  Walker    The recent case involving Andrew Speakers putative extensively drug resistant tuberculosis  XDR TB  has exposed a disturbing picture of the federal governments ability to respond to a known public health incident and protect our homeland security   Thankfully it appears unlikely that this incident has resulted in the infection of more individuals with TB  but we must determine exactly what went wrong and do all that we can to ensure this does not happen again   The miscommunication  insufficient coordination and the ultimate response on the part of the agencies involved are troubling      We  like many others  are concerned by the public health threat posed by both XDR TB and multidrug resistant tuberculosis  MDR TB   and we believe the events of the past few weeks highlight the lack of preparedness on the part of our government in responding to a public health incident   Although both XDR TB and MDR TB make up less than 2  of the over 13 000 cases of tuberculosis reported in the United States on an annual basis  they present a grave public health threat   In addition to the individual threat that is posed by drug resistant TB  this incident goes to the heart of our nations response to serious public health threats    Mr  Speakers ability to cross our borders raises questions not only about events that transpired at that inland port but in the federal governments overall approach to safeguarding our nation from public health threats before they reach our borders    We should never again have a situation where delays and failures in communication between the federal government  other domestic public health officials and relevant commercial entities lead to needless exposure and risk  We need to assure the American people that our government can respond in a coordinated manner to these types of public health incidents   This incident should serve as a wake up call that we need to establish and exercise effective plans to deal with the travel of known public health threats    To help us better understand this incident  we would like GAO to  1  review and describe the sequence of events  establishing a thorough chronological account of the significant events and communications that occurred  and  2  assess the sequence to answer the following questions     To what extent did responsible federal agencies and other key organizations  including CDC  DHS  DOT  and relevant state and local health departments  international health organizations  foreign governments  and airlines  have plans  protocols  agreements  and processes in place to provide for effective coordination and information sharing and for prompt notification and response to the incident    o To what extent were these followed      What information systems  databases  and networks were used in responding to this incident  To what extent did they provide needed information in a timely manner      What lessons learned did the incident reveal about the systems  processes  and protocols used to respond and how are agencies integrating these lessons learned to prevent future such incidents  What quarantine protocols or procedures are applicable to similar incidents  How are agencies safeguarding civil liberties when implementing changes     As you proceed with this study  we ask that GAO apprise us of any external impairment that could potentially delay its completion in a timely manner   If you have any questions regarding this request  please contact us or our staff  Mike Alexander or Aaron Firoved for Senator Lieberman  Asha Mathew for Senator Collins  David Garten or Ann Gavaghan for Senator Clinton     Sincerely    Joseph I  Lieberman  United States Senator   Susan M  Collins  United States Senator   Hillary Rodham Clinton  United States Senator
