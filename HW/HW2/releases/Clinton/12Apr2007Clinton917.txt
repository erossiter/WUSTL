April 12  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at Senate HELP Committee Hearing on Equal Pay for Women Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Thank you very much Senator Harkin and thank you for your dedication to this issue over so many years  And I do agree with Senator Enzi that I hope we can take up the Work Force Investment Act under a democratic majority   We weren t successful the last two Congresses  but now that we have a majority I think we ll be able to pass it  And I am particularly pleased because one of the provisions that is in it goes right along with what Senator Enzi has talked about  an amendment that I suggested to do more to encourage women to seek out non traditional employment in areas that historically were not very friendly to women   I think that is an important piece of the puzzle  but I don t think that obviates the need for us to enforce equal pay   And I believe that we have a real opportunity here with the legislation that I ve reintroduced  The Paycheck Fairness Act  with Senator Harkin s legislation  to really highlight the impact on families from the continuing discrimination in the work place               A 2003 Government Accountability Office report found that women s work patterns partially explain the differences between men s and women s earnings  but that even accounting for all other variables that are often used to justify the pay gap  such as time out of the work force to care for children or part time work  women still earn significantly less than men   The report also concluded that 20 percent of the wage gap could not be explained by factors other than discrimination   Now  conventional wisdom often associates the pay wage gap with low paying jobs  but this inequity is not limited to people who are in low paying jobs   Just recently  Wimbledon finally came around to paying the men and women champions the same amount of money            And we ve had a series of studies done at some of our finest universities like MIT  finding that when you held constant for time in the work force  task on job  commitment to a career  and these are some of the brightest men and women in the world who are physicists and mathematicians and chemists and everything else  there were still discriminatory effects that  to their credit  some of these institutions have been willing to face and begin to try to address             So  the Paycheck Fairness Act does three things   First  it does create strong penalties to punish those who violate the Equal Pay Act and it makes it illegal for employers to punish women who ask around about salaries   One of the things that I ve tried to do is put on my website a guide to helping women negotiate  because a lot of women are somewhat shy or reserved about negotiating over salaries   And they feel that they re just unequipped to go in and ask for higher pay or raise the fact that somebody they know  they re working with  doing a similar job or comparable job or same job  is getting paid more   And very often employers punish employees for finding out or trying to figure out what the salaries are            Second  the federal government should be a model employer in enforcing federal employment laws and will  under the Paycheck Fairness Act  be asked to use every weapon in our arsenal to ensure that women are paid the same amount as men for doing the same jobs   That includes reinstating the collection of gender based data in the current employment statistics survey  something that was discontinued under the Bush Administration  so we actually have up to date numbers showing how this issues are impacting our female employees around the country   Tax dollars should be used to bridge the equal pay gap  not make it wider            And finally  I do want to provide ways to help women strengthen their negotiation skills to help them stop discrimination before it starts or certainly to prevent it from continuing   And as Senator Harkin showed us on that graph  we have a lot work to do to get back to an economy that produces good wages for everybody with rising incomes   This is a part of that puzzle  because we certainly should not allow discrimination against women who are not only supporting themselves  but very often contributing to the family support or being the sole support of a family   But  it is in the interest of all us  men and women  and mothers and fathers  and daughters and sons to really set the goal of finally achieving equal wages for equal work   So  I want to thank Senator Harkin for his dedication to this issue and look forward to working with him to finally achieve the goal that we both share               Download Senator
