March 17  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on The Selection of Joe Boardman as Next Federal Railroad Administrator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I applaud the White House s selection of Joe Boardman  Commissioner of the New York Department of Transportation  as the next Federal Railroad Administrator  New York has always been in the forefront of transportation innovation so it is only fitting that Mr  Boardman would be the first choice for this important post  If confirmed  I look forward to working with him on the many issues critical to New York  particularly saving Amtrak services which are so vital to the state as well as addressing the vast rail safety issues facing our rail lines
