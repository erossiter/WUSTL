June 13  2007 Clinton Applauds Passage of Green Jobs Energy Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Measure Now Included in Comprehensive Energy Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  announced that the Senate has approved a green job training proposal she introduced with Senator Bernie Sanders  I VT    The measure authorizes new programs to train workers for green collar jobs that involve the design  manufacturing  installation  operation  and maintenance of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies   The amendment is now part of the comprehensive energy bill currently being debated by the Senate     To attack global warming  we need to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy  said Senator Clinton   Deploying these technologies is a win win that will reduce pollution and create new  good paying jobs   This important legislation will help to train workers to meet the needs of the growing clean energy sectors of our economy    One way to slow global warming is to use energy in a smarter way  An effective and economical way to cut consumption is to make homes and businesses more energy efficient   Trouble is  today you would have a hard time finding workers qualified to do the job  Senator Sanders said   If were smart  we can help people make their homes and offices more energy efficient and in the process create millions of good paying green jobs    The Sanders Clinton Amendment would establish an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Workforce Training Program to be administered by the Department of Labor in coordination with the Department of Energy   The amendment addresses emerging workforce shortages that could stymie growth of the renewable energy and efficiency industries   A 2006 study from the National Renewable Energy Lab  NREL  identified the shortage of skills and training as a leading non technical barrier to renewable energy and energy efficiency growth   In particular  the NREL study identified a number of critical unmet training needs  including lack of reliable installation  maintenance  and inspection services  the shortage of key technical and manufacturing skills  and failure of the educational system to provide adequate training in new technologies   The program established by the Sanders Clinton amendment would target individuals including veterans  workers displaced by economic globalization  workers seeking pathways out of poverty and into economic self sufficiency  and individuals in need of updated training   Industries eligible for training services under the program include  energy efficient building  construction  and retrofits  renewable electric power  advanced automotive drive trains  bio fuels  and the deconstruction and materials use industries       The Sanders Clinton amendment would authorize up to  40 million per year in grants on a competitive basis under a National Training Partnerships program and up to  40 million per year in grants to states to implement labor exchange and training programs  Preference would be given to states that show leadership in promoting renewable energy  energy efficiency  and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions   Eligible entities would include non profit organizations that are composed of partnerships between industry and labor  taking advantage of established programs in order to ensure the highest quality training possible   The funding would be sufficient to train between 20 000 and 30 000 workers per year   The Sanders Clinton amendment also provides up to  20 million per year for national and state industry wide research  labor market information  and labor exchange programs      As Congress advances programs to enhance our energy security and address global warming  workforce shortages are emerging in the utilities sector that could stymie growth of the renewable energy and efficiency industries  Apollo Alliance President Jerome Ringo said  According to the American Public Power Association  half of current utility workers will retire within the next decade   However  our nation is not training enough new workers to fill their places    The amendment is supported by a diverse array of renewable energy  labor  trade  environmental  and other groups  Apollo Alliance  Renewable Fuels Association  RFA
