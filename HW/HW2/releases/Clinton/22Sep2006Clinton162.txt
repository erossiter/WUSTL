September 22  2006 New York Senators Join Senators from New Jersey  Illinois  and Florida In Expressing Concern Over Ryan White Funding Formula                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Proposed Bill Would Devastate HIV AIDS Treatment in New York        Entire New York Delegation Opposes Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined with Senators from New Jersey  Illinois and Florida in expressing concern regarding the proposed bill to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act    Senators Schumer and Clinton underscored their commitment to make sure that all of those living with HIV and AIDS have the care they need and emphasized their commitment to reworking this proposal in order to ensure that states across country have the funding they need    However  taking funding away from New York and other states with the highest rates of HIV and AIDS would do nothing but magnify the problem   New York  the epicenter of the HIV AIDS epidemic  would lose over  100 million in funding under the proposed bill  which would decimate New York s care  support and treatment services            While we support providing the funding necessary to areas in the country where case rates of HIV AIDS are increasing and where Ryan White funding is currently insufficient  we cannot support a reauthorization that destabilizes established systems of care and devastates and potentially destroys the ability of high prevalence communities to address need    Without modifications to address our concerns  we stand united on behalf of New Yorkers living with HIV AIDS in objecting to this bill   Senators Schumer and Clinton wrote             The following is the text of the letter Senators Schumer and Clinton sent today to Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid expressing their opposition to the bill and the text of a letter the Senators wrote  along with their colleagues from New Jersey  Illinois and Florida  to Senator Reid and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist              The Honorable Harry Reid  Minority Leader  528 Hart Senate Office Building  United States Senate  Washington  DC 20510    Dear Senator Reid     We write to you to object to the unanimous consent agreement regarding the Ryan White HIV AIDS Treatment Modernization Act   As the Senators from the state with the highest HIV AIDS prevalence in the nation  we continue to have serious concerns regarding the potentially devastating impact the Ryan White HIV AIDS Treatment Modernization Act will have on our state             The Ryan White HIV AIDS Treatment Modernization Act unanimous consent agreement that was put before the Senate last evening will have a harmful effect upon New Yorkers living with HIV and AIDS   New York State stands to lose more than  78 million in Ryan White Title II funds over four years  Communities that now receive directed state funds through the emerging communities program  like Buffalo and Albany  will also experience reductions in their grant   In addition  the localities in New York that receive Ryan White Title I funds face substantial cuts   For example  it is estimated New York City stands to lose as much as  17 million in FY 2007   Long Island is likely to see a reduction of almost half its award and Dutchess County is likely to become ineligible for Title I funds during the authorization period   Our constituents living with HIV AIDS in every region of the state will be adversely affected    from New York City to Western New York              Under the unanimous consent agreement  New Yorkers living with HIV AIDS in will face grave reductions in care  support and treatment services   While we support providing the funding necessary to areas in the country where case rates of HIV AIDS are increasing and where Ryan White funding is currently insufficient  we cannot support a reauthorization that destabilizes established systems of care and devastates and potentially destroys the ability of high prevalence communities to address need            Without modifications to address our concerns  we stand united on behalf of New Yorkers living with HIV AIDS in objecting to this bill             Thank you for noting our objection             Sincerely          Charles E  Schumer       Hillary Rodham Clinton             September 22  2006                 The Honorable William Frist M D   Majority Leader  United States Senate  S 230  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510    The Honorable Harry Reid  Democratic Leader  United States Senate  S 221  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510    Dear Senator Frist and Senator Reid     We write to you as a coalition of Senators representing both rural and urban areas from all regions of the United States to express our concerns over the Ryan White CARE Act  legislation that is currently under consideration           For the past two decades  our states have been working to provide care  treatment and support services to those living with HIV and AIDS in our states    We represent the areas hardest hit by the epidemic    the cities in which HIV first appeared  and where so many came together to develop the programs which have long been models for service delivery   At the same time  the emergence of the epidemic in new communities has been particularly prevalent in our states  including increases among women and minority populations    The services provided through Ryan White CARE Act programs in our states are essential to the well being of the over 250 000 people living with HIV and AIDS that we represent            While we appreciate the significant effort that has gone into this bill  we have several questions about this legislation that remain unanswered    Without such information  we cannot accurately assess the impact of reauthorization upon our states           The principals in the bicameral bipartisan negotiating process have repeatedly assured us that the losses to our state programs can be restored through the supplemental funding pool available through the base grant funding in Title II of the CARE Act  largely due to  70 million in new funding that will be provided to the Title II base   However  there is a disparity between the Senate and House committee reports for the Departments of Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  and Other Related Agencies Appropriations bills of funding for the Title II base program  with the Senate language placing the funding into the AIDS Drug Assistance Program  rather than the Title II base formula    If the restoration of the losses to our state governments is dependent upon this  70 million being made available to the Title II base funding  then it is essential that there is agreement as to how this money will be spent prior to reauthorization            We are also concerned that there will not be enough funding available in Title I under the proposed reauthorization to address the concerns of Chicago  Jersey City  Miami  New York City  Bergen County  Long Island  and other eligible metropolitan areas  EMAs     The impact of the formula shift has not yet been fully evaluated  and it remains unclear whether the amount in the reduced supplemental pool will cover the needs of such EMAs    We understand the competitive nature of Title I supplemental grant funding  and the year to year fluctuations that occur under this application process   However  we would like additional information as to whether the amount available throughout the life of reauthorization is enough to enable the provision of total Title I awards comparable to those provided under current law            Finally  we are concerned that we do not have adequate information about the impact on both code based and names based states if current law were to continue    The Senate committee report for the Departments of Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  and Other Related Agencies Appropriations bill contains explicit language directing the Health Resources and Services Administration  HRSA   in the absence of reauthorization  to distribute the funds according to the same methodologies used in FY 2006    We would like to know  if current law stands  how HRSA will implement the direction provided in this committee report           As the states that have experienced the heaviest burden of the AIDS epidemic  we are very much aware of the importance of the Ryan White CARE Act in helping to provide essential care and treatment services   Because we have seen the benefits of these programs in our states and local communities  we are committed to ensuring that the reauthorization of this bill strengthens and improves the ability of all Americans to access HIV and AIDS care  support and treatment services    A reauthorization that destabilizes established systems of care and devastates and potentially destroys the ability of high prevalence communities to address need is unacceptable  We look forward to working with you to address these concerns prior to this bill moving forward in the Senate            Sincerely   Charles E  Schumer  Frank Lautenberg  Richard J  Durbin  Bill Nelson  Hillary Rodham Clinton  Barack Obama  Robert Menendez
