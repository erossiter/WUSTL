August 7  2006 Senator Clinton  Healthcare Advocates Join in Calling for a Decision on Plan B                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Senator Clinton  representatives from NARAL  Planned Parenthood  Family Planning Advocates and the healthcare community call for politics to be removed from the approval process      Senator calls on Bush Administration to reject a recess appointment for FDA Acting Commissioner von Eschenbach New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined with healthcare advocates and representatives from Planned Parenthood  NARAL Pro Choice New York and Family Planning Advocates of New York State at a press conference to call on Acting FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach to stop the continual delaying tactics and make a decision on Plan B            We  re within months of the three year mark since the FDA  s own expert staff and advisory panels voted overwhelmingly to make this emergency birth control available without a prescription  with no age restriction  During this time we have seen two successive FDA commissioners block Plan B from being sold over the counter  overruling the FDA  s medical experts  advisors  and the recommendations of over 70 organizations  including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics     Senator Clinton said   It is outrageous that under this Administration  an agency entrusted with making unbiased decisions based on science has abused its authority and allowed ideology to govern its decision making             Senator Clinton  along with her colleague Senator Patty Murray  has long been fighting for a decision on Plan B  s application  Last week the Senators underscored that they will maintain their hold on von Eschenbach  s nomination for FDA Commissioner until a decision is made             Our citizens look to the FDA to give its Good Housekeeping seal of approval   They need to trust that the Agency is making decisions based solely on science   I  m afraid that the gold standard which FDA has held for so long is in jeopardy  At a time when too many decisions in Washington are being governed by politics and not the facts  we need to make our voices heard that this delay is unacceptable and the FDA owes the American people a decision     Senator Clinton said           At the press conference  at the Helen B  Atkinson Health Center  Senator Clinton  who was also joined by Assemblyman Keith Wright  called on the Administration to reject a recess appointment for von Eschenbach    My colleague Patty Murray and I have placed a hold on von Eschenbach  s nomination  I call on the President to respect the role of the Senate and not bypass Congress by appointing von Eschenbach during the recess     Senator Clinton said            Planned Parenthood calls on the FDA to quit stalling and live up to its mission of protecting the public s health and well being  There is no scientific basis for denying EC over the counter availability   For too long  the FDA has put ideology above science and the health of women and families     said Joan Malin  President and CEO  Planned Parenthood of New York City            The 62 million American women of child bearing age have been awaiting action from the FDA for three long years now  In that time  politics have been allowed to trump science and the integrity of the FDA s decision making process has become suspect   If the FDA is to regain the public trust  they must keep their promise and issue a decision   one that is based on their own medical findings  They must move to make emergency contraception over the counter  We can wait no longer     said Mary Alice Carr  Vice President for Communications  NARAL Pro Choice New York            We thank Senator Clinton for standing up for women s health and pushing the FDA to make a decision on this critical issue     said Catherine Abate  chair of the board of Family Planning Advocates of New York State and president and CEO of Community Healthcare Network    The FDA s own advisory committees recommended making Plan B available over the counter  yet the scientific evidence continues to be ignored with each new delay tactic the Agency introduces             At his Senate confirmation hearing last week  Senator Clinton pressed acting FDA Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach on the continuing unusual handling of the pending application to sell Plan B over the counter   After years of delay and nearly a year of silence on the Plan B application  FDA on the eve of Dr  von Eschenbach  s confirmation hearing sent a letter to the manufacturer of Plan B asking for a meeting to discuss the status of the application   Senator Clinton  along with Senator Patty Murray  placed a hold on Dr  von Eschenbach  s nomination and made clear they would not lift the hold until the FDA makes a decision on Plan B  yes or no   Senator Clinton recently made clear that this hold will stay in place until the FDA makes a decision            At the hearing last week  Senator Clinton questioned Dr  von Eschenbach on whether or not he would accept a recess appointment before a decision is made on Plan B   Dr  von Eschenbach indicated that he wanted the Senate Committee to consider his nomination on the merits   Senator Clinton also pressed Dr  von Eschenbach on a letter released by the FDA that suggested that  if the FDA approves Plan B for over the counter sale to those 18 and over  the FDA would hold the maker of Plan B to an unusual standard  requiring the producer    not retailers selling Plan B    to police and enforce age restrictions on the sale of Plan B   Senator Clinton secured a commitment from Dr  von Eschenbach that the FDA would not hold the producer of Plan B to unprecedented standards to enforce limitations on its sale beyond what has been expected of any other company
