December 5  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Senate Commerce Committee  s Decision to Hold Hearings on the New TSA Proposal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I want to commend Commerce  Science and Transportation Committee Chairman Stevens and Co Chairman Inouye for their quick decision to heed calls for hearings to probe the TSA  s decision to reintroduce dangerous items back onboard commercial aviation flights   This decision is very disturbing and key officials within the Department of Homeland Security owe the American people answers as to how this decision will make the flying public safer   We must not cede one inch gained in aviation security to the terrorists who seek to exploit existing vulnerabilities much like they did on September 11  2001   While I applaud the TSA  s desire to increase attentiveness to explosives detection  I do not believe reintroducing dangerous items back onboard commercial flights is the best way to do that   The Commerce Committee  s hearings will hopefully make sure these concerns are addressed adequately before the changes are implemented in the coming weeks   Our citizens and flight crews deserve nothing less than our full dedication to reduce threats onboard commercial flights
