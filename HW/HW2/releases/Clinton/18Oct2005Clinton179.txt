October 18  2005 tatement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Proposal to Eliminate the State and Local Tax Deduction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement today on the proposal to eliminate the state and local tax deduction by the bipartisan panel on taxes appointed by the President           It is very troubling to hear that the President  s tax reform panel has recommended the elimination of a tax benefit for over 3 2 million New York families who are disproportionately burdened by high property and state income taxes  This misguided proposal will impact every municipality that depends on these taxes to fund essential public services ranging from education to public safety  New York  s delegation has a proud tradition of protecting its constituents from bad tax policy and defending the state and local tax deduction going back to 1986  the last time there was an effort to eliminate this benefit  and we will all work together to defeat this proposal again   If the President is truly committed to a bipartisan consensus on tax reform  he will dismiss this proposal immediately
