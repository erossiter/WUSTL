June 8  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on al Zarkawi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         As a leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq  Abu Musab al Zarkawi was responsible for despicable attacks that claimed the lives of too many Iraqis and Americans  I saw firsthand the terrible consequences of Zarqawi s terrorist network when Bill  Chelsea and I visited the hotel ballroom in Amman  Jordan last November where Zarqawi s followers had detonated a bomb at a wedding party  killing and wounding innocent people  We owe our thanks to our men and women in uniform and others in Iraq who have been fighting Zarqawi and other insurgents and who are responsible for today s success             I hope that this will be a blow to the insurgency in Iraq and affords an opportunity for the new Iraqi government to build on this success and provide greater security and stability for the Iraqi people
