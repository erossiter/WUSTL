August 1  2007 Clinton Introduces Legislation to Help Communities with TCE Contamination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Introduces Toxic Chemical Exposure Reduction Act   TCE Reduction Act    Bill Requires the EPA to Protect the Public from Exposure to Trichloroethylene  TCE                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today announced that she has introduced the TCE Reduction Act to require the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to set tougher regulations to protect the public from exposure to the carcinogenic chemical Trichloroethylene  TCE     Today s announcement follows earlier efforts by Senator Clinton to urge the EPA to address the growing TCE contamination crisis in New York   The legislation is cosponsored by Senators Dole  R NC   Boxer  D CA   Lautenberg  D NJ  and Kerry  D MA    Representatives Solis and Hinchey plan to introduce companion legislation in the United States House of Representatives    TCE is one of the most widespread industrial water contaminants in the nation  and is found at many sites across New York   Of the 86 federal Superfund sites in New York alone  more than 30 have been found by the EPA to have TCE contamination   Endicott  Franklin Square  Garden City  Hopewell Junction  Ithaca  Norwich and Victor are a few of the communities throughout New York that are known to be contaminated with TCE   Senator Clinton s bill follows lengthy delays by EPA in setting a new standard in the face of growing scientific evidence and contamination that is more widespread    It is unacceptable that the EPA has failed to protect the public from TCE in the face of stronger scientific evidence that it causes cancer  and growing exposure problems in New York and across the country   Numerous scientific studies make it clear that TCE has the potential to cause cancer  damage the nervous and immune systems  and cause developmental effects in children  Unfortunately  the EPA has ignored the science rather than taking action   As a result of EPA delays  communities across New York continue to be exposed to potentially toxic levels of TCE  Senator Clinton said  The  TCE Reduction Act  will force the EPA to protect children and other vulnerable populations from TCE in the water they drink and the air they breathe  Senator Clinton said    The government has failed the people of New York who face the threat of TCE contamination  Congressman Hinchey said  This bill will help complement the legislation we recently passed in the House that directs additional funds to the EPA for the agency to expedite work on developing a revised and final TCE risk assessment as was recommended by the National Research Council  This will be one more weapon in our arsenal to get the federal government to focus its attention and make progress on preventing human health threats posed by the pervasive TCE contamination in parts of New York and throughout the nation   I look forward to working with Vice Chairwoman Solis to draft the House version of Senator Clinton s bill     A draft EPA Risk Assessment in 2001 found TCE to be as much as 40 times more carcinogenic than previously thought  but rather than using EPA science to set a more protective standard for TCE in drinking water  the Bush administration called for more study   The National Research Council  NRC  was directed to conduct an in depth study the health studies involving TCE   Far from repudiating EPA s 2001 findings  the final NRC report  issued in 2006  found that the evidence on carcinogenic risk and other health hazards from exposure to trichloroethylene has strengthened since 2001  The report went on to say  The committee recommends that federal agencies finalize their risk assessment with currently available data so that risk management decisions can be made expeditiously    Senator Clinton has previously pressed the EPA to set a standard based on the latest science  but the EPA has failed to act or set a timeline   According to the EPAs website  EPA does not plan to release a revised standard until the end of 2010     The TCE Reduction Act would force EPAs hand  requiring EPA to     Issue a revised health advisory for TCE within 6 months of enactment     Issue revised draft health standards for TCE in drinking water within 12 months of enactment  and final drinking water standards within 18 months     Issue a health advisory standard for TCE vapor intrusion within 12 months of enactment     Establish an Integrated Risk Information System  IRIS  reference concentration  RfC  of TCE vapor within 18 months of enactment     Ensure that all standards set under the bill fully protect susceptible populations  including pregnant women  infants  and children  from the adverse health affects of TCE    Click here to download a list of many of the confirmed TCE sites in New York
