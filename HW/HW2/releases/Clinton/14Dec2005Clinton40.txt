                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senator Clinton Joins Senate Colleagues in Letter to President on Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    As the elections in Iraq move forward  Senator Clinton has joined 40 of her Senate colleagues in sending a letter to the President urging him to engage in a frank dialogue with the American people about what lies ahead in Iraq and reiterating the position of a bipartisan majority of the Senate that the Iraqi people take the lead in defending and governing their country   In the letter  the Senators encouraged the President to provide the public with a plan for Iraq    we regret that the American people have still not been presented with a plan that identifies the remaining political  economic  and military benchmarks that must be met in order to facilitate the phased redeployment of U S  forces and a reasonable schedule to achieve them              Senator Clinton also today praised the women in Iraq who are bravely taking a stand to protect their rights and encouraged women to vote in the elections and continue to push for women  s rights as the Iraqi constitution is drafted            Senator Clinton  s statement on the importance of women  s rights in Iraq and the text of the letter to the President follow        Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Protecting Women  s Rights in Iraq      Every day the women in Iraq are braving great odds to secure for themselves a political future that protects their rights and those of their daughters and granddaughters   Thousands of women have offered themselves as candidates in the upcoming elections  thousands more will come forward to monitor the polls    Women s groups and women from numerous political parties have joined together to advocate for strong protections for women s rights in the constitution  and that fight will continue until the language of that constitution is finalized next year   Women are already preparing to advocate for changes in social policy  greater transparency in government  and laws to fight corruption          I hope that women will vote in large numbers in the December 15th elections  and that those who are elected will continue to push for strong protections for women in Iraq   Activists and leaders throughout the world know that their struggle will strengthen the cause of women everywhere             The text of the letter to the President          December 14  2005         The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500       Dear Mr  President        All Americans recognize the historic nature of the elections for a permanent  democratic government in Iraq on Thursday   We salute our courageous men and women in uniform  who are serving proudly in Iraq under enormously difficult circumstances  and whose dedication and sacrifice are making these elections possible             Like you  we hope the elections will proceed peacefully and the Iraqi people will succeed in electing a legitimate government that is capable of uniting the Sunni  Shiite and Kurdish people   We know that successful elections can play an important part in defeating the insurgency and hastening the day when Iraqis can govern themselves without outside assistance          We also know that the work of the Iraqi people to build the kind of Iraq we would all like to see does not end with these elections   It is vital that the Iraqis move more quickly toward inclusive political solutions   The four month period after the Iraqi elections  when the new government will attempt to finalize a Constitution  is perhaps the most critical time for the Iraqis and our troops   That is why 79 members of the Senate  including 41 Republicans  voted last month for an amendment that said    calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty  with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq  thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq      A strong bipartisan majority of the Senate believes Iraqis must now step forward in the months ahead and take the lead in defending and governing their own country          Your leadership will be essential in achieving this objective   As was stated in the bipartisan amendment that passed the Senate    the  Bush  Administration should tell the leaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad based and sustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq within the schedule they set for themselves      Your leadership will also be needed to ensure that we leverage the influence of the international community and Iraq  s neighbors to push for a sustainable political compromise  and that we stand up sufficient numbers of capable Iraqi security forces so that our troops can begin standing down          Finally  we also believe that you must engage in a frank and honest dialogue with the American people and our troops about the road ahead in Iraq   As the bipartisan amendment stated    the  Bush  Administration needs to explain to Congress and the American people its strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq      While we appreciate your recent speeches on this issue  we regret that the American people have still not been presented with a plan that identifies the remaining political  economic  and military benchmarks that must be met and a reasonable schedule to achieve them   We hope you will use Wednesday  s speech to finally provide a detailed explanation of your strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq          The window of time to get things right in Iraq may be rapidly closing   The successful completion of our mission is possible only through the hard work of the Iraqi people and the effective leadership of your Administration   We stand ready to work with the Iraqi people and your Administration in the days ahead             Sincerely
