May 15  2006 Clinton and Lowey Announce Congressional Resolution to Strengthen Family Planning Services for Women                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Clinton Also Announces Legislation to Strengthen and Extend Medicaid Coverage of Family Planning Services for Low Income Women and Families Port Chester  NY    In honor of the kick off of Women s Health Week  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congresswoman Nita Lowey announced that they will introduce a Congressional resolution in support of strengthening family planning services              I believe it  s more important than ever that we fight to protect a woman  s right to make her own decisions about her reproductive health     Senator Clinton said    Our resolution will make it clear that Congress recognizes that educating and supporting women so that they do not become pregnant in the first place is one of our most important investments             Whether it  s through contraceptive equity  increasing funding for Title X  or encouraging states to expand Medicaid family planning services  expanding access to contraception should be a shared national goal     said Congresswoman Lowey     If you are for reducing unintended pregnancies and abortions  than you should be for family planning   It  s as simple as that  and that is exactly what Senator Clinton and I call for in our resolution that we intend to introduce in Congress             The Clinton Lowey resolution calls on all members of Congress to put themselves on the record in support of family planning services and education  The resolution does not cost any money  it simply asks that Congress officially go on the record in support of programs and policies that make it easier for all women at all income levels to obtain contraceptives and use them consistently and correctly over time          Recently  the non partisan Guttmacher Institute released a major report revealing the tragic two tiered system that is steadily emerging in our country  High income women have quick  convenient access to contraceptives  while low income women do not and as a result more often become pregnant unintentionally   In fact  a poor woman is four times as likely to experience an unplanned pregnancy as a higher income woman          The United States has one of the highest rates of unintended pregnancies in the industrialized world   Half of the 6 million pregnancies in America are unintended  and nearly half of those end in abortion every year  Lack of coverage for contraception and other health care costs result in women of reproductive age paying 68  more in out of pocket costs for health care services than do men of the same age          Furthermore  the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 that passed the Senate in late December placed family planning services in further jeopardy   The new law eliminated a longstanding guarantee  in place since 1972  which guaranteed that all Medicaid enrollees are covered for family planning services and supplies   The new law allows states to offer stripped down benefit packages to some enrollees  including some parents and pregnant women          At the press conference Senator Clinton also announced that she will be introducing legislation   the Unintended Pregnancy Reduction Act of 2006    that will strengthen Medicaid coverage of family planning services  by ensuring that Medicaid coverage for family planning services remains accessible to low income women          The Senator  s legislation  which she will introduce with Senator Harry Reid  D NV   will also amend the Medicaid statute to ensure that states extend coverage for family planning services and supplies to women who would be entitled to Medicaid funded prenatal  labor  delivery and postpartum care            I hope my colleagues in the Senate  from both sides of the debate  Republicans and Democrats  join me in ensuring all women have the family planning services they need  so that together we can help to decrease the amount of unintended pregnancies     Clinton said
