October 31  2006 Senator Clinton Calls for New American Consensus to Meet Foreign Policy Challenges                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Outlines Three Principles to Guide Foreign Policy       Read the full text of Senator Clinton s remarks    New York  NY    In a major policy address at the Council on Foreign Relations  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called for a reversal of the basic foreign policy principles of the last six years to rely on diplomacy  international institutions and balancing our idealism with realism to reduce American isolation  succeed in the war on terror and deal with Iraq and other increasingly difficult challenges    Senator Clinton outlined three principles that should underlie a new American consensus on national security and form the foundation for meeting the challenges we face             Nothing is more urgent than for us to begin building a new bipartisan consensus to ensure our interests  increase our security and advance our values   said Senator Clinton            Senator Clinton detailed three principles that should guide our foreign policy and discussed how they apply to some of the most difficult challenges we face                   First  we must renew our internationalism for a new century    Senator Clinton emphasized that we did not face World War II or the Cold War alone and we cannot face the global terrorist threat or other profound challenges alone    She noted that a terrorist cell may recruit in southeast Asia  raise funds in the Middle East and plan attacks in the United States or Europe   We can stop a deadly disease anywhere along the line as it hopscotches from continent to continent or we can wait until it arrives at our doors    Senator Clinton underscored that we cannot turn our back on international institutions   We have to modernize them and where needed create new ones                   Second  we must value strong diplomacy as well as a strong military    Senator Clinton emphasized that we should not hesitate to engage in the world s most difficult conflicts on the diplomatic front   We cannot leave the Mideast to solve itself or avoid direct talks with North Korea   Direct negotiations are not a sign of weakness   They re a sign of leadership                  Third  our foreign policy must blend both idealism and realism in the service of American interests   Senator Clinton underscored that we have to debunk the false choice between idealism and realism   The challenges of today s world require a mix of idealism and realism to solve    Each requires building a consensus approach that is accepted by broad coalitions of nations   She noted that we cannot achieve any of them without American leadership  nor can we achieve any of them alone    In an increasingly interdependent world  it is in our interest to promote our values   But reality informs us that we cannot force nations to accept them    we have to support those who embrace them and lead by example             Senator Clinton emphasized that these principles would force a sea change from the current administration s policies   She noted that if you look at the most dangerous situations we are facing today    Iraq  Afghanistan  Iran  North Korea  the proliferation of deadly weapons  the prosecution of the war on terror    you will see the same mistakes repeated over and over  the mistaken belief that alliances  international institutions  even respect for others  opinions  were irrelevant to America s interests  the mistaken belief that diplomacy even if backed by force was synonymous with weakness  the mistaken belief that our military s experience in war planning  our intelligence community s objective analysis  and our diplomats  experience in negotiations could be dismissed and replaced with ideological wishful thinking  and  in Iraq  the mistake of waging a pre emptive war based on faulty intelligence  fanciful scenarios and bluster has turned out to be a one time only doctrine with no deterrent effect              We need to return to patient diplomacy  backed by military strength and informed by American values   said Senator Clinton            Senator Clinton described the urgent need to apply these principles to the major national security challenges we face                Iraq  Senator Clinton emphasized that we need a fundamental change in course   First  we need to press the Iraqis to get serious about achieving an internal reconciliation and political solution  and present real consequences for failing to do so    Second  we need a public international conference of the parties in the region to make public commitments to Iraq s stability   Third  we should begin a phased redeployment   It is time to insist that the Iraqis to take the lead and demonstrate to the Iraqi people that the U S  will not be in Iraq permanently                 Afghanistan  Senator Clinton noted that our failures have squandered much of what our military accomplished   Afghanistan and NATO need us as a leading partner  to help with security  rooting out corruption  finding alternatives to opium and improving the situation with Pakistan                Iran  Senator Clinton underscored that U S  policy must be unequivocal   Iran must not build or acquire nuclear weapons   We should keep all options on the table  including being ready to talk directly to Iranians should the right opportunity present itself                 North Korea  Senator Clinton noted that we have had six years of a policy with no carrots  no sticks  and only bad results   Now we have fewer options and a much more difficult task   She emphasized that Kim Jong Il needs to hear a single  unified message  choose between nuclear weapons and his interest in aid from South Korea  China  and the international community   He cannot have both                 Nuclear Non proliferation  Senator Clinton emphasized that we need to modernize the non proliferation treaties and related agreements to reflect the new challenges we face   Senator Clinton announced that she will call for joint hearings by the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees on the future of our non proliferation policy with the aim of creating a new blueprint for our shared security    She also announced that she will introduce legislation based on ideas advanced by Sam Nunn and Ted Turner through the Nuclear Threat Initiative to safeguard weapons usable materials to prevent terrorist groups from getting hold of nuclear weapons or materials    Senator Clinton s bill also would create a senior White House advisor for countering nuclear terrorism and require a yearly report that would specify every site with nuclear material or weapons in the world  how vulnerable the material is  how desirable a target it would be and what we intend to do about it                War on Terror  Senator Clinton underscored that the Administration has failed to transform our national security institutions and asked our military to fulfill missions for which it is not sized  equipped or funded    The administration has failed when it comes to homeland security and failed to complete reform and restore morale in the intelligence community   We don t have nearly enough civilian capacity to manage pre  and post crisis situations   Senator Clinton underscored that in addition to addressing these challenges  we should  like we did in the Cold War  challenge a generation of universities and students to serve their country by learning the languages and cultures of the societies where our greatest threats are incubating         Related content    Statements and remarks by Senator Clinton concerning the war in
