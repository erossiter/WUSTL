                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Experts Focus on the Link Between Green Technologies and Economic Development     Senator Clinton Keynotes Industry Forum Hosted By U S  Green Building Council and Greater Rochester

New York Region joined together today at a forum examining ways of   Turning Green into Growth              The forum was hosted by Greater Rochester Enterprise  GRE   an economic development organization dedicated to revitalizing the Rochester regional economy  Stantec  an international architectural and engineering firm  and the U S  Green Building Council  USGBC   a non profit coalition of industry leaders working to promote buildings that are environmentally responsible  profitable and healthy  The event aimed to give local industry leaders practical tools to move toward   green    building  and to help move Rochester toward the goal of being a clean energy leader          The day long forum  held at Benderson Development  s HSBC Auditorium in downtown Rochester  was the brainchild of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  who is committed to looking at ways to position Rochester and the region as one of the nation  s centers of innovation for alternative energy technologies             Green building means big energy and cost savings for communities across America     said Sandy Wiggins  chairman elect of the U S  Green Building Council    On average  LEED certified green buildings save 30 percent on energy costs  50 percent on water use costs  and pay for themselves in less than three years  Going green is a key strategy for our nation  s energy independence and a peaceful  prosperous future   It just makes sense               This forum is about building a   green   Rochester and harnessing the region  s strengths to make it a leader in clean energy research and development     Senator Clinton said    Alternative energy holds tremendous economic potential  and by focusing on   green   technology  Rochester can be at the forefront of the alternative energy push in more ways than one             In June of this year  Senator Clinton joined with New Jobs for New York  Greater Rochester Enterprise  and RENEW NY to host a conference in Rochester showcasing the job creation potential of the alternative energy industry in New York State  The conference    Alternative Energy in New York  Expo 2006     brought together entrepreneurs and academic researchers from Upstate New York with investors and industry leaders from across the country to create the partnerships needed to accelerate job growth and ignite investment in alternative energy companies and technologies in the region  Following the conference  Senator Clinton  s office contacted the Green Building Council  which agreed to hold the   Turning Green into Growth    forum          The   Turning Green into Growth    morning session included Senator Clinton  s keynote speech and a discussion moderated by Senator Clinton that included panelists Peter Arsenault  Principal Architect  Stantec Architecture  Eric Reiser  Vice President  Strategic Programs  Johnson Controls  and Jay Murdoch  Technical Marketing Manager  Insulation Systems Business  Owens Corning  Arsenault highlighted Stantec  s role in the design of the Frito Lay green building project in Henrietta  a suburb of Rochester            It was a great experience for Stantec to work with Frito Lay  a client that had a true desire to make an impact on the built environment by pursuing a sustainable facility     Arsenault said    If the entire Rochester Region embraced these same green building goals  one can only imagine the possibilities for the future             The morning session was followed by an afternoon charrette design session  which highlighted the Rochester Region  s assets and focused on potential green building opportunities for the entire area  Stantec and USGBC led this meeting of community leaders  including architects  engineers  developers  and municipal and university planners
