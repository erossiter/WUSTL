September 27  2006 Senator Clinton Announces Initial Funding for  Heroes At Home  Included in Defense Appropriations Bill Conference Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Funding Will Help Returning Service Members and Their Families Adjust to Life Back at Home Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report includes  3 million to provide initial funding for the  Heroes at Home  legislation she authored which was authorized in June as part of the DoD Authorization bill  The funding will help Guard and Reserve members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and their families get the readjustment help they need and deserve back in their hometowns and communities            I am proud that we are one step closer to being able to provide this additional service that addresses the challenges men and women in uniform encounter as they return home from Iraq and Afghanistan  Not only will this funding provide assistance to our returning members of the Guard and Reserve  it will help their family members rebuild relationships with their loved ones who have been overseas and possibly injured  physically or mentally  in battle   said Senator Clinton           The funding Senator Clinton is working to secure will help support community based programs that provide mental health and readjustment assistance to National Guard and Reserve members and their families  since many of these troops return to local communities scattered across the country far away from military bases and VA hospitals  The funding will bolster community resources to more effectively support our newest generation of Guard and Reserve members and their families after deployment  Despite more services offered at DOD and VA facilities  service members often are still reluctant to go to traditional military or veterans   mental health clinics due to fear of stigma and concerns about confidentiality  and their family members may not be eligible           With this funding  programs offered in places like community clinics  community colleges  and family support organizations will be better equipped to help Guard and Reservist members and their families with mental health problems  by providing education to increase awareness about Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and other readjustment concerns and making referrals for additional care  if needed  The community focus of this effort is crucial because many Guard and Reservist members and their loved ones will first turn to resources in their local communities and neighborhoods for assistance with challenges like PTSD  depression  and relationship difficulties            Providing funding for community based services for Guardsmen and Reservists is a key part of Senator Clinton  s larger   Heroes at Home    effort  Her comprehensive   Heroes at Home    bill  approved in June as an amendment to the DOD Authorization bill  includes several key initiatives to assist military service members of Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF  and Operation Enduring Freedom  OEF  with transition to work  PTSD and other mental health issues  and traumatic brain injury  TBI   The measure  which is supported by the National Military Family Association and the Wounded Warrior Project  also provides support to the family members of our returning troops          Specifically  the funded measure requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a special working group  partnering representatives from the public and private sectors to identify the needs of returning National Guard and Reserve members in their transition to civilian jobs after deployment  including members who have been injured while serving  and to develop recommendations on ways to improve assistance to them  In addition  the existing DOD Task Force on Mental Health is charged with assessing mental health conditions  including PTSD  occurring in National Guard and Reserve members undergoing multiple deployments and with making recommendations for improving mental health services for them  The measure further delegates an office in DOD specifically for employers  employment assistance organizations  and associations of employers to provide them with best practices  education  and other resources for ensuring the success of Guard and Reserve members in resuming civilian work  The measure also calls for a study on the long term physical and mental health consequences and rehabilitation needs of traumatic brain injured service members  as well as on the types of long term care services available to them  To further assist the mushrooming number of traumatic brain injured service members and their families  the measure would establish TBI family caregiver training curricula for health professionals at DOD and VA hospitals  who would use the curricula to teach family members important skills for caring for their loved ones suffering from TBI when they go home
