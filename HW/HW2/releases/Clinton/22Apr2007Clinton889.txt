April 22  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Earth Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Earth Day is not just a day to celebrate the beauty of our planet  it is a day that calls us to action   The planet does not belong just to us  but to all those who will come after us   We have a fundamental moral obligation to be good stewards   to leave our planet cleaner  safer and healthier for our children and grandchildren   And first and foremost  that means tackling the growing threat of global warming            Earlier this month  the United Nations issued a major scientific report that reflected input from more than 2500 scientists from 130 countries   That report shows that global warming is already changing the way that our planet functions  and that bigger changes are to come if we do not take this problem head on   If we do not take steps to reduce global warming pollution  we are likely to see increased droughts and floods  more intense hurricanes  changes in agricultural systems  increased coastal flooding due to sea level rise  and human health impacts ranging from more widespread hunger in the developing world to more deaths from heat waves in North America           This is a challenge that we must meet  and I hope that we all commit ourselves to act on global warming as we celebrate this Earth Day
