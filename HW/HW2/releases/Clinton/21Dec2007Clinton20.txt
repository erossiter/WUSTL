December 21  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on Nuclear Regulatory Commission to Address Continuing Safety  Security and Emergency Preparedness Problems at Indian Point                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Cites Concerns with Failure to Install Adequate Emergency Siren System and Coming Move to Dry Cask Storage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  to address continuing problems at Indian Point with safety  security and emergency preparedness   In a letter to Chairman Klein  Senator Clinton highlighted in particular two issues that exemplify the concerns  the failure of Entergy to install an adequate new emergency siren system and the coming move to dry cask storage of spent fuel at Indian Point    The continuing drumbeat of problems at Indian Point has undermined public confidence in both Entergy and the NRC   How the siren and dry cask storage issues are handled in the coming months will send a signal to the public about whether there is a renewed commitment to public safety by federal regulators and the plants owners   I urge the NRC to use this opportunity to demonstrate a new seriousness about getting it right at Indian Point  Senator Clinton wrote    Senator Clinton has worked to push both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  and Entergy to improve safety  security and emergency preparedness at the plant  including the siren system  Senator Clinton added a provision to the energy bill in 2005 to require Entergy to install a new siren system with battery backup in response to repeated failures of the Indian Point siren system due to a lack of backup power  That provision was signed into law in August of 2005  and the NRC set a January 2007 deadline for having the system operational  Entergy applied for and received an extension of the deadline to April 15th  and subsequently missed the deadline  NRC fined Entergy  130 000 and Senator Clinton announced that she would sponsor Senate companion legislation to a bill to be sponsored in the U S  House by Congresswoman Nita Lowey  D Westchester Rockland  and Congressman John Hall  D Hudson Valley   that would steer fines levied by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for safety violations to counties surrounding nuclear facilities in order to assist them with emergency planning  see   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 274453    Earlier this year  Senator Clinton announced that she would be asking the DHS inspector general to evaluate why Entergy has failed to meet established deadlines to achieve operability of a new alert and notification system for the Indian Point nuclear power plant  see   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 281505   Senator Clinton has also continued to call for the NRC to conduct an Independent Safety Assessment  ISA  at Indian Point and has introduced legislation to require an ISA at the plant    The following is the text of Senator Clintons letter to NRC Chairman Klein    Dr  Dale E  Klein  Chairman  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  Washington  D C  20555   Dear Chairman Klein    I have worked hard over the last six years to push both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  and Entergy to improve safety  security and emergency preparedness at Indian Point   While improvements have been made  problems persist at the plant   At the same time  new issues and challenges continue to emerge   I write today regarding two issues that exemplify these two types of concerns  the failure of Entergy to install an adequate new emergency siren system  and the coming move to dry cask storage of spent fuel at Indian Point    I am extremely dismayed about the continued failure of Entergy to put a siren system in place that meets the requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  and the related Nuclear Regulatory Commission orders   We will soon reach the one year anniversary of the date by which the new siren system with backup power was supposed to be in place   When that original deadline approached  Entergy applied for and received an extension of the deadline to April 15th of 2007   Entergy subsequently missed that extended deadline  and was fined  130 000 by the NRC   Since that time  Entergy and the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  have been in talks to discuss how the new siren system can be modified to meet the applicable requirements   In my view  it is time for the NRC to become more involved in order to drive these talks to a conclusion  and then to use its enforcement tools to force Entergy to devote the resources that are required to achieve the long delayed goal of having a new siren system in place that complies with the law and enhances public safety      In addition  I note that Entergy will soon move spent fuel rods from pools at Indian Point to dry cask storage on site   This action will have benefits  in particular  it will enable Indian Point to empty the spent fuel pool that has been leaking water contaminated with strontium 90 into the environment   At the same time  any action involving spent fuel presents potential hazards and security risks   With these risks in mind  I urge you to take whatever measures are required to ensure that Entergy puts public safety and security first during this new phase of operations at Indian Point      The continuing drumbeat of problems at Indian Point has undermined public confidence in both Entergy and the NRC   How the siren and dry cask storage issues are handled in the coming months will send a signal to the public about whether there is a renewed commitment to public safety by federal regulators and the plants owners   I urge the NRC to use this opportunity to demonstrate a new seriousness about getting it right at Indian Point      Sincerely yours   Hillary Rodham Clinton
