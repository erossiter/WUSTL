November 1  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Report of the President s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I am particularly troubled to see that the President  s Tax Reform Panel has recommended the elimination of a tax benefit for over 3 2 million New York families and millions more households in every state who would be burdened by double taxation  The elimination of this benefit would impact every municipality in the nation that depends on these taxes to fund essential public services  ranging from education to public safety          It is important that any effort towards tax reform maintain some basic elements of progressivity  fairness and fiscal responsibility   Given that the Commission  s proposal eliminates the state and local tax deduction  significantly curbs the mortgage interest deduction and assumes revenue losses identical to the President s tax cut agenda  it is not clear if these conditions have been met  Simply put  tax reform should not come at the expense of benefits to the middle class or fiscal responsibility
