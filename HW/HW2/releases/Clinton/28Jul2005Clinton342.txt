

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill  entitled the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  and Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU   was approved by the Conference Committee on which Senator Clinton served  which includes an additional  15 5 million for Long Island projects  out of a total of over  230 million in special projects for New York  Senators Schumer and Clinton announced a substantial increase of approximately  3 billion in additional funding coming to New York State for highways and transit for a total of over  16 5 billion in total federal spending for New York   Specifically  the legislation includes  10 07 billion in highway funds and  6 5 billion for New York State  s transit systems  a 19 percent increase in annual average highway spending and a 30 percent increase in public transit funding compared to the previous six year transportation authorization bill   The bill also contains funding for research  safety  environment  transportation planning and security that will benefit all New Yorkers       Senator Clinton served as a member of the Conference between the House and Senate due to her role as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee   Senator Schumer is a member of the Banking and Finance Committees  which control the transit funding and tax portions of the bill   Both Senators fought hard to ensure that provisions important to New York were retained in the Conference Report            These funds keep New Yorkers moving quickly and safely  while creating jobs across the state  These federal dollars will be a huge shot in the arm for local transit needs   new buses  repairs for buses  and fixing up our stations   and highway repairs   Without first rate highway and transit facilities  Long Island and New York would literally stop short   Schumer said         After two years of hard work  we have achieved a bill that will create jobs and bring significant resources to Long Island   These funds will go a long way towards helping communities make the infrastructure improvements needed to keep their economies moving     said Senator Clinton  who served as a Senate conferee in negotiations on the bill    I am proud that our efforts have resulted in New York s share of funds growing to meet the ever increasing transportation demands on our state   We have made a substantial contribution to the future of Long Island by investing in these critical road and transit projects  The funds for the East Side Access project are great news for our city  s transportation infrastructure and even better news for commuters  They will not only have an impact on the daily lives of people traveling from Queens and Long Island  but they also represent an important investment in the long term future of our public transportation system  I am also especially pleased that we were able to secure these funds for the revitalization efforts underway in New Cassel because mainstreet revitalization is so important  especially on Long Island           The funding approved in the bill today includes         Preserving East Side Access and the Second Avenue Subway  s high position on the list of projects eligible to receive Federal Transit Administration Full Funding Grant Agreements   Both projects are listed on the   Final Design and Construction    category  and could receive hundreds of millions more dollars in the future   Last week  the Senators secured  365 million total for both projects in the Senate Transportation Appropriations Bill  approved by the Committee on Appropriations last week and scheduled for floor consideration later this year   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has concluded that the Lexington Avenue  4 5 6  subway line is at capacity and that no additional trains can run on that line  With only one subway line serving the East Side  the Lexington Avenue line is the most overcrowded subway in the country  carrying 600 000 people each day         The East Side Access Project  a joint federal state effort  is a rail link from the Long Island Railroad via the 63rd Street Tunnel to Grand Central Station that will help tens of thousands of Nassau  Suffolk and Queens commuters cut up to three hours off their daily commutes  The project will also free up much needed capacity in Penn Station  take thousands of cars off congested New York roads and help remove 800 tons of pollutants from the air        10 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton for the Nassau County Hub enhancements  in addition to funds provided by the House for a total of approximately  16 million   This is in addition to the  2 million provided for in the FY 2006 Senate Transportation Appropriations Bill   The Nassau County Hub Enhancements will help transform the center of the county into a major regional business center  The Nassau Hub corridor is located in central Nassau County and is surrounded by the LIRR s Port Jefferson line and Hempstead Turnpike  Schumer and Clinton said the new funding could be used for possible improvements to the  hub  including new roads  a light rail system  new parking facilities  pedestrian and bicycle ways and new infrastructure connecting the hub s commercial  recreational and industrial areas  including Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum         1 5 million that Senators Clinton and Schumer secured for Suffolk Road Improvements   These funds will be provided to the county for necessary traffic and road improvements  streetscape and sidewalk enhancements  and other road improvements as needed         2 million that Senators Clinton and Schumer secured for improvements and enhancements for Oak Beach Road in the Town of Babylon in addition to funding provided by the House         2 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for roadway  pedestrian  and streetscape improvements for the New Cassel Revitalization Project in North Hempstead  The funding will support road and streetscape improvements along the Prospect Avenue and Union Avenue corridors in the economically distressed hamlet of New Cassel   The project will transform these corridors  the community s  Main Streets   into a pedestrian friendly  safe  business and shopping friendly district          Senators Schumer and Clinton today also announced the approval of several of their own provisions  including          Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway   Senators Clinton and Schumer secured language in this bill renaming all of I 86 after the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  a fitting tribute to a man who once chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee and who fought hard in previous transportation reauthorization bills for the needs of New York   Senator Clinton introduced an Amendment last year that was accepted by the Senate during consideration of the surface transportation reauthorization bill   The provision was retained in this year s bill and will now become law        National System Study Commission   The Conference Report contains a provision creating the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that Senator Clinton authored as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee   This Commission will determine the future transportation needs of New York and the nation   This Commission will combine the National Transportation System Study and the Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund into one single commission   Senator Clinton worked with former NYSDOT Commissioner and current Federal Railroad Administrator Joe Boardman to push this idea forward   The objective of combining these two bodies into a comprehensive evaluation of the future of transportation and its financing provides a roadmap for better allocation of transportation funding resources in the future   A better allocation will mean funding based on needs  which can only help New York   It will hopefully result in rewards for New York because of high transit use  which contributes to a more sustainable transportation network      CargoWatch Technology   the Senators secured  3 5 million for PAR Technology s CargoWatch Transportation Management Program   This funding is in addition to funds added in the House  These funds will be used to identify  track  and manage cargo within containers along with associated over the road assets from point of origin until destination  Tracking container shipping supply chains will provide essential national security and efficient transportation management   The tracking system is being developed by PAR Technologies  based in New Hartford  NY         The Conference Report is now scheduled to be considered by both the Senate and the House sometime later this week  After passing each house  the approved Report will then go to the President s desk to be signed   The bill originally passed the House on March 10 and the Senate on May 17   The new project funding is in addition to any money already approved by the House
