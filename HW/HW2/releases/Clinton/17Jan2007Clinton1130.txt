                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Read Senator Clinton s trip report from Iraq and Afghanistan   Washington  DC   Senators Evan Bayh  D IN  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   and Congressman John M  McHugh  R NY   held a press conference to discuss their Congressional Delegation  CODEL  visit to U S  Forces serving in the Central Command Area of Responsibility  including Iraq and Afghanistan  Below is the text of Senator Clinton s remarks             Thank you very much  As some of you know  I sit next to Senator Bayh on the Armed Services Committee and Congressman McHugh and I have the great honor of representing the 10th Mountain Division  which is based at Fort Drum in Upstate New York  It  s the most deployed division in the United States Army           We went into Lahore for the purpose of meeting with President Musharraf  a meeting that lasted approximately 90 minutes  During that extensive  broad discussion  President Musharraf described some of his frustrations with his relationships with the Afghan government  We  ve heard about some of the difficulties on both sides of the border in preventing the resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda forces from going back and forth  And when we were in Afghanistan our military commanders described to us the challenges that they have faced with the increased penetration coming from the Pakistani side of the border           Obviously  from President Musharraf  s perspective  he has some legitimate questions about how best to work with his Afghan counterparts that he shared with us  He raised his concerns about the state of relationship between Afghanistan and Pakistan  And I am concerned that when we most need troops on the ground in Afghanistan and a very tight relationship that is focused on good intelligence and military intervention to prevent the resurgence of the Taliban and Al Qaeda  we might have some difficulties between our two great allies          I discussed with both President Karzai and President Musharraf whether a high level United States envoy on a continuing basis would be helpful and they both expressed a positive reaction  As some of you might remember  President Bush had both Presidents to dinner together to try to work out some of their concerns  And upon returning to the United States  I placed a call to the White House and spoke with the National Security Advisor  Steve Hadley  to urge that the President consider appointing such a high level Presidential envoy           From Pakistan  we flew to Ramstein Air Force Base where we spent another very short night  And the next morning traveled to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center  where seriously wounded service members from Iraq and Afghanistan are brought for treatment  We were very impressed with the high quality of services available to our men and women in uniform and I met New Yorkers there  Senator Bayh met soldiers and marines from Indiana  But I could certainly assure everyone who has a loved one in these theaters of combat that they have the very best care available  In fact  I met one soldier who had suffered an injury in Fallujah and he is from New York City  so I called his mother to tell his mother that he was doing very well  And I could say that because he certainly was           I also heard from some of the soldiers   their concerns about the circumstances they find themselves in   in Iraq  One told us  as he was lying in his bed with his injuries  that in encountering one of these shape charges  these new more advanced  more sophisticated command controlled IEDs  that the armored  fully equipped Humvee had saved his life and the life of his buddies  We talked later about how we still don  t have that vehicle  fully packed  available to everybody  something that we still have not accomplished    We met with our U S  Commanders as well and toured the Contingency Aeromedical Staging Facility  which is the first stop for our brave wounded heroes when they come back for medical care before being taken home          During these intense four days  we had the opportunity to talk with U S  military serving in the theaters  with our U S  civilian representatives and certainly with foreign leaders  My experiences underscored my concerns based on both what I saw and what I did not see  We saw American service men and women performing bravely and magnificently and we also saw a strategy that is not working  I personally did not see the kind of tangible evidence of actions that we should be expecting from the Iraqi government  And I believe our priorities are upside down  Afghanistan is a success story thus far  and yet we know it  s going to be under increasing pressure in the months ahead  We should be adding more American military forces and we should be requiring the NATO countries to fulfill their commitments to the forces that they had promised us           In Iraq  the prescription is the opposite  Rather than an escalation of U S  troops  which I do not believe will contribute to long term success in Iraq  we should be beginning a phased redeployment of U S  troops as a way to put pressure on the Iraqi government to take responsibility for its own security and future           The President is sending mixed signals  He has finally said that this is not an open ended commitment in Iraq  but he is providing the Iraqis with an open ended presence of American troops  We need to change course           It would be a great irony if the Administration  s emphasis on escalating our presence in Iraq caused it to ignore the threat facing Afghanistan where those responsible for planning the September 11 attacks are still our enemies  The President  s team is pursuing a failed strategy in Iraq as it edges closer to collapse and Afghanistan needs more of our concerted effort and attention           I support making several changes  Secretary  Senator  Bayh and I sent a letter today to Secretary of Defense Gates reflecting what we heard from our military commanders  they asked for additional troops  Now  if they are asking us  I assume they are asking others as well  They were asking for two additional infantry battalions in the south and that if  as is planned  there is a rotation out of a battalion in the east and that it will eventually be re deployed to Iraq  that that battalion be replaced or not moved           I plan to introduce legislation with regard to Iraq that includes three components  First  it will cap the number of troops in Iraq at the levels they existed on January 1st and will require the Administration to seek Congressional authorization for any additional troops  This type of troop limit has ample historical precedent including a cap on the number of U S  troops in Lebanon in 1983 and more recently  Congress has limited the number of U S  troops in Columbia  Second  as a means to increase our leverage with the Iraqi government  my legislation would also impose conditions for continued funding of the Iraqi security forces and the private contractors working for the Iraqis  It would require certification that the security forces were free of sectarian and militia influence and were assuming greater responsibility for Iraqi security           I do not support cutting funding for American troops  but I do support cutting funding for Iraqi forces if the Iraqi government does not meet set conditions  Finally  my legislation will require the Administration to meet additional conditions for success in Iraq  including the assumption of greater responsibilities by the Iraqi government within six months           The Administration has claimed that it intends to hold the Iraqi government to certain conditions and this legislation will ensure that both the Bush Administration and the Iraqi government meet their commitments  The conditions would require the Administration to certify that Iraq has disarmed the militias  ensure equitable sharing of oil revenues  make the constitutional changes to ensure rights for each ethnic community  reverse de Baathification to allow teachers  professionals and others who joined the Baath party as a means to get a job to serve in the new Iraqi government  It would require the Administration to engage in a regional diplomatic initiative  including all of Iraq  s neighbors to address Iraq  s future and begin the phased redeployment of U S  troops  If these conditions are not met  or not on the way to being met within six months  the Congressional authorization requirement would be triggered           We all know that this is a very difficult dilemma that is confronting our country  There are many concerns on both sides of the aisle  Before we came in here  some of you heard my colleagues  Senator Biden  Senator Hagel  who have been working with Senator Levin  Senator Reid and others to present a bipartisan resolution of disapproval of the President  s policy  I certainly will support that  But from what I have heard out of the Administration thus far  I think we will eventually have to move to tougher requirements on the Administration to get their attention           This is a grave matter  America  s vital national security interests are involved and certainly the lives and the health of our young men and women in uniform is at stake and the Iraqi people  s future is as well  So  I hope that we can start having a discussion in the Congress among ourselves and with the Administration that will lead to a change of course and not adding more troops  pursuing a strategy that under present circumstances cannot be successful        Click here for more of Senator Clinton s statements concerning the war in Iraq
