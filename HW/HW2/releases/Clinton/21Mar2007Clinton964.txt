                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Senators Told of Crisis Facing Those Impacted by 911 and the Healthcare Facilities that Treat Them Who Will Run Out of Funds if Federal Assistance Not Made Available                Washington  DC   Senator Edward M  Kennedy  Chairman of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today chaired a hearing of the HELP Committee into 9 11 health effects and their continuing legacy for untold numbers of New Yorkers and others   The hearing today was the first Senate hearing on the urgent health needs affecting thousands in the wake of 9 11            The HELP committee heard from a number of witnesses who outlined the extent of the health crisis  what is currently being done to help affected populations and what is needed from the federal government to assist   The Committee heard from The Honorable Michael R  Bloomberg  Mayor of the City of New York  Dr  Robin Herbert  M D   Co Director of the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program  Dr  Kerry J  Kelly  M D   Chief Medical Officer  New York City Fire Department  Dr  Joan Reibman  M D   Director of the Bellevue Hospital World Trade Center Environmental Health Center  Dr  Jim Melius  M D   Ph D   Chair  Advisory Board of the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program  Dr  Jeanne Mager Stellman  Mailman School of Public Health  Columbia University and Jeff Endean  ground zero volunteer and former Division Commander for Morris County  NJ Sheriff s Office          In addition to the witnesses  there were a number of affected groups represented at the hearing  including firefighters  police officers  other first responders  workers  residents  students and teachers           Senators Clinton and Kennedy  along with their colleagues  Senators Schumer  Lautenberg and Menendez  introduced the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act which would authorize  1 9 billion in grants for medical and mental health monitoring and treatment for those exposed to the dust and toxins in the days  weeks  and months following the attacks   In addition to providing an avenue for their colleagues in the Senate to better understand and address these issues  it is the Senators  hope that the HELP Committee will also mark up the legislation soon             Thanks to the studies conducted by the Fire Department of New York and the Mt  Sinai Center for Occupational and Environmental Medicine  we know that there is a connection between illnesses in many of these heroes and their presence in the impacted area   The recent report issued by New York City Mayor Bloomberg s World Trade Center Health Panel also makes clear why there is a need for long term  sustained federal funding          A transcript of Senator Clinton s opening statement to the Committee is below        OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON   U S  SENATE COMMITTEE ON HEALTH  EDUCATION  LABOR  AND PENSIONS   Hearing  The Long Term Health Impacts from September 11  A Review of Treatment  Diagnosis and Monitoring Efforts    I appreciate greatly both of you  Senators Kennedy and Enzi  for being at this hearing   Senator Enzi started this work when he was Chairman of this committee back in the fall and I m very grateful to him   He and his staff have approached this with a seriousness of purpose  an open mind  and I thank them very much and your staff as well Senator Enzi  And of course Chairman Kennedy   There isn t anybody in Congress  probably in the country  who has done more to help people who are in need than he has   And I m confident that with his leadership we will make progress on these problems we will support today at this hearing   I also want to recognize and thank my colleague and friend Congressman Jerry Nadler  who represents lower Manhattan   Congressman Nadler has been a very vigorous and sometimes lonely voice talking about the long term implications of what people experienced because of the horrific attacks on 9 11            And I d like to thank Mayor Bloomberg who has taken on this issue with a great deal of concern and put his staff on and lead experts  This report that the Mayor has issued addressing the health effects of 9 11 is a great road map  Both leading us from what the problems are and to potential solutions   We re going to hear from a range of witnesses   I ll have more to say about them as they testify today   But  each of them comes with experience and expertise that will be very beneficial to us as we try to craft a solution   And finally  Mr  Chairman  I d like to recognize the people who are suffering with health problems and those who represent them            We have a tremendous team here from New York  Obviously  the people who are on the front lines suffering are the ones who are the most compelling because what they have gone through            People such as Steven Hess  an emergency medical technician  who used to easily be able to bench press 250 pounds  but now has trouble lifting his grandson            Marvin Bethea  a paramedic who managed not only to escape being buried in a pile of debris  but continued to work day after day until 2004 when he could no longer  who has suffered both respiratory and mental health effects and a stroke that is attributed to the stresses he experienced            Craig Hall  who lives in downtown Manhattan with this family   When he and his family returned to their apartment after 9 11  they began experiencing eye irritation  nose bleeds  persistent cough  sinus problems  allergies  and reduced lung capacity   The concerns he has for the future health of his children and the ailments that he and his neighbors are suffering brings him here today            We also have some of the union officials who have been fighting for more assistance and without them and their leadership  and also  as Senator Enzi pointed out  without a lot of the union pension funds that helped benefit funding available  a lot of the people who we were worried about had no care what so ever   I want to recognize Denis Hughes  President of the New York State AFL CIO  Steven Cassidy  President of the New York City Uniformed Firefighters Association  Ed Malloy  President of the Building and Construction Trades  Dick Ianuzzi  President of the New York State United Teachers and  representatives from the Uniformed Fire Officers Association  AFSCME  the police unions and others            Now we will have in this audience people  every one of who could testify   Obviously  that is not possible  but they are here to bear witness   And when they have a chance to speak to the press or other forms of New York  their testimony is riveting  compelling and heartbreaking           People like retired Detective Mike Valentin  who was caught in the dust and debris and when he came out from the collapse from the towers he began experiencing severe health effects    In July 2005  doctors discovered not only the 9 11 related asthma  but a tumor in his chest  a second tumor in his gall bladder  and changes to his lungs that are often a precursor of mesothelioma  All of which his doctors believe are linked to his exposures            We cannot forget those who have already died  Individuals like Detective James Zadroga  whose death at age 34 was directly caused by his exposure to toxic fumes and dust at Ground Zero            So  Mr  Chairman and ranking member Enzi  there are thousands of stories because there are tens of thousands of people who have been affected   The first responders  we have the workers  the volunteers  the residents   And we are determined to do whatever we can  both in the short term to make sure that the Fire Department and Mount Sinai have funding they need to continue treatment they have started  and then in the longer term to give us a program that we can say fully meets the needs of those who are suffering   So  Mr Chaiman I will ask unanimous consent to put my whole statement in the record and I appreciate very much your holding this hearing                Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the health effects of 9 11
