                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Funding Comes as Thousands of Patients are Seeking Treatment for 9 11 Related Illness  with Numbers Rising Every Month   Funds to Expand Treatment to Residents  Office and Commercial Workers  Volunteers  Students  and Other Individuals   Call for Focus on Long Term  Comprehensive Solution to Screen and Monitor all Individuals who were Exposed to the Environmental Hazards at WTC S  Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles Schumer today announced that a key Senate Committee has included an additional  55 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center     The funding  which comes in addition to the  50 million that was provided in the recent Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill  was included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill by the Senate Labor  HHS  Education and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee  The bill now moves to the full Senate Appropriations Committee where it is expected to be approved on Thursday    I am very pleased that this additional funding is coming to help those who have continued to suffer from the lingering results of the 9 11 attacks  Senator Clinton said   We continue to hear tragic stories from first responders  office workers  residents  students and others who are crippled by diseases and health problems resulting from exposure to toxic substances released by the attacks  While the Administration has not yet provided the necessary funding for these 9 11 health treatment centers  those of us close to this issue are keenly aware that without this funding  they are constantly under the threat of having to close their doors altogether  It is our national responsibility to care for those who did our country proud in the hours  days  weeks and months following that horrific attack   We cannot let 9 11s living victims down  We will do everything we can to fight to get the funding that is needed to continue these vital health tracking and treatment services    These workers were injured serving our nation in its greatest time of need  and now America must fulfill its responsibility to care for them in their time of need  Schumer said  I am pleased to see this funding going to the men and women who risked life and limb to bring America back after 9 11  but our work is not complete  More of our heroes develop debilitating diseases every year  yet we must still scratch and claw for every penny needed to take care of them  That is not right  We will continue to fight for full funding for our first responders to ensure they receive the attention and care they deserve    Specifically  the  55 million will go towards treatment  screening  and monitoring activities administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to help those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released on and after 9 11  The bill also includes language requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to expand the program beyond responders and rescue workers to entities that would provide services to residents  office and commercial workers  volunteers  students  and other individuals who were exposed  Existing programs to serve those who were impacted include the centers in the Mt Sinai Consortium and the program run by the New York City Fire Department    Finally  the bill approved today encourages the development of a long term  comprehensive solution to screen and monitor all individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards at the World Trade Center  WTC  site following the terrorist attacks on September 11  2001 and the provision of comprehensive medical services for those experiencing illnesses or injuries as a result of these exposures     Senators Clinton and Schumer said that the funding approved late yesterday is a recognition of the importance of addressing the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  and affirms the commitment of the federal government to provide assistance to those whose physical and mental health was adversely impacted as a result of this exposure  More than five years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among residents  rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among many of those that have been exposed      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the lasting health effects of 9 11
