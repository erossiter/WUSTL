November 17  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Yesterday  s Floods in Upstate New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I am very concerned that once again Binghamton and parts of the Southern Tier have been hit by heavy rains and flooding  As we know all too well  these areas were hit very hard earlier this year and are once again mopping up and clearing the debris left by Mother Nature  With Binghamton the hardest hit  I have spoken to Broome County Executive Barabara Fiala and my office is speaking to representatives from across the impacted area to offer help and support  I and my office stand ready to do whatever we can to assist        Since the June floods  my office has been in constant contact with FEMA and the U S  Army Corps of Engineers on the issues of relief  recovery and debris removal  Communities across Central New York and the Southern Tier have been cleaning up and rebuilding for months now  but tons of debris that was washed down into local lakes and rivers remains  This debris has significantly raised water levels in lakes and rivers which many believe may have exacerbated the impact of yesterday  s rains  I will continue to work with FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers to do what needs to be done in the short and long term          In August  Senator Clinton called on the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to help those areas affected by the June floods  In a letter to the Army Corps  Senator Clinton pointed out that in many places  debris problems in streams and rivers from prior flooding were exacerbated during the June floods
