October 28  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on U S  District Court Ruling Against NYRI s Request to Use Eminent Domain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The decision to dismiss the NYRI lawsuit is a win for New Yorkers who live along the proposed route  said Senator Clinton  I remain opposed to the current NYRI proposal  and I continue to believe that New York should have the final say on the project    On Friday  a federal judge in U S  District Court in Albany dismissed a lawsuit by NYRI that challenged a state law protecting homeowners from the use of eminent domain by private power companies  Following this decision  the Department of Energy  DOE  stated that groups such as NYRI would need to spend another year trying to negotiate solutions with states  If the negotiations fail  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  could intervene and approve the use of eminent domain     Earlier this month  the DOE announced the designation of a Mid Atlantic National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor  NIETC  that includes the area in which the proposed NYRI project would be located    Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005  Congress authorized the Department of Energy to designate NIETCs in congested areas of the high voltage power grid   The law also granted the FERC new authority to permit construction of transmission lines in the designated NIET corridors to companies like NYRI   The most problematic provision of that law gives power line permit holders  like NYRI  the right to petition in U S  district court to acquire rights of way for the construction of transmission lines through the power of eminent domain  Under current law  a project such as NYRI would be allowed to use the new federal right of eminent domain to condemn private property along its route between Utica and Orange County    Earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined with Senator Schumer in introducing legislation to fix the law in order to give New York and other states the final say on siting of power lines
