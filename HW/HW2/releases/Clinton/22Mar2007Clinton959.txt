                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   At a press conference on Capitol Hill  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Arlen Specter  R PA  and Representatives James Moran  D VA  and Chris Shays  R CT  today joined with public service leaders  educators and students to call for the creation of a U S  Public Service Academy  The U S  Public Service Academy Act  The PSA Act  will establish an undergraduate academy designed to cultivate a new generation of young leaders dedicated to public service   Modeled after the military service academies  the Public Service Academy will provide a four year  federally subsidized college education for more than 5 000 students a year in exchange for a five year commitment to public service following graduation               We face big challenges as a nation that will require an active leadership and citizenry  I have no doubt that Americans are ready  willing  and able to answer the call and that is exactly what this Academy would demonstrate every single day  The United States Public Service Academy will tap into the renewed sense of patriotism and civic obligation among our young people  I am proud to work with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle and both chambers of Congress to make this idea a reality   said Senator Clinton             I am pleased to cosponsor legislation to establish a U S  Public Service Academy   Senator Specter said    The academy would develop leaders with a strong foundation in civics and provide the country with a generation dedicated to public service             The U S  Public Service Academy will be the premier training ground for the next generation of public servants   Our public sector faces a brain drain with the impending retirement of the Baby Boom generation   Based on the success of the U S  military academies  we believe this institution will help close that gap  providing the foundation for the civil service leaders of tomorrow   said Representative Moran            We need a  West Point  of public service  to encourage more young Americans to commit to a career in public service and the build the skills necessary to provide successful leadership in the public sector   Representative Shays said  who service as Co Chair of the National Service Caucus    I am so excited to work with Senators Clinton and Specter and Representative Moran to build bipartisan support for this powerful idea            The Academy is an historic opportunity to build an institution that will change the way young people perceive  prepare for  and pursue public service   said Chris Myers Asch  architect of Public Service Academy concept               The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that more than two million teachers will be needed in classrooms across the country in the next decade   At the same time  more than 80 percent of the nation s 17 000 law enforcement agencies report that they cannot fill needed positions due to a lack of qualified candidates  Graduates of the Public Service Academy will help to fill these vacancies by serving their county for five years after graduation in areas such as civil service  the public sector  and other needed fields           A recent study by the Higher Education Research Institute found that more than two thirds of a college freshman class expressed a desire to serve others  though the rising cost of college tuition is a barrier to choosing a career in public service   The Public Service Academy will allow such students the opportunity to go to college and tap into the strong desire to serve that already exists among college students             Prospective applicants to the Academy will follow a nomination process similar to that used for admission to the military academies where each senator and representative nominates candidates from their state for consideration             Senators Clinton and Specter are joined in sponsoring the bill by Senators Barbara Mikulski  D MD   Joseph Biden  D DE   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Mary Landrieu  D LA  and Kay Bailey Hutchison  R TX   Representative Moran and Shays are joined in sponsoring the House version of the bill by Danny K  Davis  D IL   Tom Davis  R VA   Diana DeGette  D CO   Lloyd Doggett  D TX   Sam Farr  D CA   Charles Gonzales  D TX   Al Green  D TX   Gene Green  D TX   Ruben Hinojosa  D TX   Sheila Jackson Lee  D TX   Eddie Bernice Johnson  D TX   Nick Lampson  D TX   John Lewis  D GA   Doris Matsui  D CA   Jim McDermott  D WA   Eleanor Holmes Norton  D DC   Solomon Ortiz  D TX   and Bennie Thompson  D MS   The PSA Act was first introduced in both the Senate and the House of Representatives during the 109th Congress
