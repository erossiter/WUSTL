May 10  2005 Senator Clinton Encourages Groups to Seek  Funding for Services to Holocaust Survivors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Thousands of New York s Hungarian Holocaust survivors   could be eligible for social assistance under the settlement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             New York  NY   With a court ordered deadline approaching  Sen  Hillary Rodham Clinton urged Jewish social service organizations to consider seeking funding from the settlement of the Hungarian Gold Train litigation  Thousands of Hungarian Holocaust survivors in New York may be eligible for aid under the terms of a settlement        Last month  a federal judge preliminarily approved a settlement between Hungarian Holocaust survivors and the United States government in the case of the Hungarian Gold Train  The key element in the settlement was the Government s agreement to pay up to  25 5 million  of which approximately  21 million will be used to fund social service projects provided by local agencies to benefit Hungarian Holocaust survivors worldwide  In addition  the settlement provides for the creation of an archival and educational record of the incident  The government will also issue a statement accepting responsibility in this incident         For years we have been trying to achieve some kind of resolution for Hungarian survivors of the Holocaust  While nothing can heal the wounds suffered by so many of these survivors  we now have the opportunity to help them in some meaningful way   Senator Clinton said   I am grateful that our government finally saw fit to provide long overdue redress to these aging men and women and I would encourage social service providers to come forward and apply for these funds so they can get the help they need         Under the terms of the settlement  a proposed plan for distribution of the funds will be sent to the judge by June 10 by the Conference on Material Claims Against Germany  the  Claims Conference    in consultation with the class counsel and Hungarian Holocaust survivors  The aid will be provided by existing social service agencies with a record of demonstrated experience and capability providing services to Nazi victims  Clinton urged Jewish organizations which provide such services to contact the Claims Conference to learn how they may seek to participate in the settlement         For over a year  Senator Clinton has pushed for a resolution in the Gold Train case  In March of 2004  Senator Clinton wrote to Attorney General John Ashcroft to ask for immediate action on the case  amid reports that officials at the United States Department of Justice were  dragging their feet  on resolving the matter  In May  Senator Clinton joined with Sen  Arlen Specter  R PA   and several of her Senate colleagues in a bipartisan letter calling on the Attorney General to solve the matter with survivors  In October  Senator Clinton issued a statement before the Senate urging the Justice Department to end  half a century of silence and cover up  and provide these survivors with the adequate compensation they deserve  Senator Clinton also reached out directly to the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel to urge resolution in this case        The Settlement does not provide for direct payments to Class Members as compensation for property lost on the Gold Train  Instead  the money will fund social service programs benefiting eligible recipients        In May of 1945  a train laden with valuables that had been seized from Hungarian Jews by the Nazis was turned over to US forces  Unfortunately  the United States maintained that the origin of the valuables was  unidentifiable  and the train s contents were never returned to their owners  According to the U S  Commission on Holocaust Assets  the Gold Train was an  egregious failure  of the United States to follow its own policy regarding restitution of property after World War II  Over a thousand New Yorkers and other Americans who faced Nazi cruelty and fled oppressive forces during or after World War II were waiting for justice for the mishandling of their property from the so called  gold train          To access more information about the application process or the settlement  go to http

Government and Hungarian Holocaust survivors in the matter of the Hungarian Gold Train  Thousands of New York s Hungarian Holocaust survivors who courageously stood up for their rights in this matter stand to potentially benefit from the terms of the settlement and achieve some measure of justice from the horrors they faced        In May of 1945  a train laden with valuables that had been seized from Hungarian Jews by the Nazis was turned over to U S  forces  Unfortunately  the United States maintained that the origin of the valuables was  unidentifiable  and the train s contents were never returned to their owners  According to the U S  Commission on Holocaust Assets  the Gold Train was an  egregious failure  of the United States to follow its own policy regarding restitution of property after World War II  Thousands of New Yorkers and other Americans who faced Nazi cruelty and fled oppressive forces during or after World War II were waiting for justice for the mishandling of their property from the so called  gold train          Finally  this March the Justice Department settled litigation brought by Hungarian Holocaust survivors  achieving the resolution they long deserved  The settlement of up to  25 5 million does not provide cash payments for the survivors  however it will fund the social service needs of ailing  aging and infirm Hungarian Holocaust survivors  In addition  it will create an archival and educational record of the incident  Finally  and significantly  the government will issue a statement at long last accepting responsibility in this incident  Federal District Judge Patricia Seitz has preliminarily approved the settlement  and will issue a final ruling in the fall        By June 10  the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany  Claims Conference   in consultation with the class counsel and Hungarian Holocaust survivors  will recommend to the Judge which social service agencies in relevant countries are eligible to access the funding in the provision of services to Hungarian Holocaust survivors         If you have provided services to Holocaust survivors in the past and believe you are eligible to provide such services to Hungarian Holocaust survivors  I urge you to contact the Claims Conference and the attorneys representing the Holocaust survivors to get more details about the settlement

to act on this pressing issue to achieve the resolution deserved by the survivors who were literally dying as their case languished  While nothing can heal the wounds suffered by many of these survivors  I am grateful and relieved that our government is providing long overdue redress to these aging men and women        Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton
