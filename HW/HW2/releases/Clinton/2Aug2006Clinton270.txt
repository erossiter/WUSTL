August 2  2006 Senator Clinton Presses Deputy Defense Secretary on Rumsfeld Forgoing Public Appearance Before the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    After sending a letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld calling on him to appear at tomorrow  s open hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee  full text of letter below   Senator Clinton pressed Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England at this afternoon  s hearing about Rumsfeld  s decision to forgo appearing at tomorrow  s open committee hearing  choosing instead to only appear in private           Transcript of Senator Clinton  s interaction with Dep  Defense Secretary England      Senator Clinton  Welcome General Gonzales  Secretary England   Secretary England  I appreciate very much your being here  because I think it is important  and I assume you agree  to have our civilian leadership testify before this committee          Secretary England  Yes  I do          Senator Clinton  You know  Secretary England  I  m not sure you  re aware  but  the leadership of this committee  Chairman Warner  formally invited Secretary Rumsfeld to appear before us in an open hearing tomorrow  alongside General Pace and General Abizaid  because of the pressing importance of the issue to be discussed  namely Iraq  Afghanistan  the Middle East  our country  s policies affecting each of those areas   Unfortunately Secretary Rumsfeld has declined to do so   He has instead opted to appear only in private settings   I understand yesterday he appeared behind closed doors with the Republican Senators   I  m told tomorrow he will be appearing again behind closed doors with all Senators   But I  m concerned  Mr  Secretary  because I think that this committee and the American public deserve to hear from the Secretary of Defense   We  re going to be out in our states for the recess   Obviously these matters are much on the minds of our constituents  and I would appreciate your conveying the concern that I  and certainly the leadership which invited the Secretary to be here  have with his inability to schedule an appearance before this committee to discuss the most important issues facing our country  I appreciate your agreement that it is important to have our civilian leadership appear and obviously we will look forward to having out military leadership tomorrow but I think it  s hard to understand why the Secretary would not appear in public  before this committee  answer our questions  answer the questions that are on the minds of our constituents            Senator Clinton  following a comment from Committee Chairman John Warner   I think it is abundantly clear  however  to the members of this committee as it is to countless Americans  that the Secretary has been a very involved manager in the military decision making that has gone on in the last five years and in fact in recent publications there  s quite a great deal of detail as to the Secretary  s decision making   One might even say interference  second guessing  overruling the military leadership of our country   And I for one am deeply disturbed at the failures  the constant  consistent failures of strategy with respect to Iraq  Afghanistan  and elsewhere    And I don  t think that those failures can be appropriately attributed to our military leadership   So although the Secretary finds time to address the Republican Senators  although he finds time to address us behind closed doors  I think the American people deserve to see the principle decision maker when it comes to these matters that are putting our young men and women at risk   More than 2 500 of them have lost their lives   And this Secretary of Defense  I think  owes the American people more than he is providing   So I appreciate the invitation that you extended as is your wont   You worked very hard  I know  to create the environment in which we would have the opportunity to question the Secretary   Unfortunately  he chose only to make himself available to us behind closed doors  out of view of the public  the press  our constituents  our military and their families and I think that is unfortunate          The full letter sent to Secretary Rumsfeld follows          August 2  2006      The Honorable Donald H  Rumsfeld  Secretary of Defense  United States Department of Defense  The Pentagon  Suite 319  Washington  D C  20301      Dear Mr  Secretary       I write to urge you to reconsider your decision to decline testifying at a public hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday           As you know  on Thursday the Committee will hold a hearing to receive testimony on Iraq  Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism   General Peter Pace  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and General John Abizaid  the Commander of Central Command  are scheduled to testify    According to the notice of the hearing posted by the Armed Services Committee  you will not be joining Generals Pace and Abizaid despite a formal invitation extended to you by the Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman and Ranking Member   Instead  you will appear at a closed briefing open only to Senators later in the day          As the Senate Committee with primary jurisdiction over the United States military  the Armed Services Committee plays a critical role in conducting oversight over our operations in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere   Recent events in both Iraq and Afghanistan demonstrate that our forces face difficult challenges in defeating committed insurgencies  providing greater security and helping to foster stable governments            Since the last time you testified at a public hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee was February 7  2006    nearly six months ago    a public appearance before the committee is long overdue   As the top official at the Pentagon  you are responsible for implementing the President  s Iraq and Afghanistan policies  and for making recommendations to the President as to future plans in both theaters   With approximately 130 000 troops currently serving in Iraq and 20 000 troops serving in Afghanistan in increasingly more dangerous circumstances  the Committee  and more importantly  the American people should hear directly from you           In our democracy  our military comes under civilian control and policy decisions are made by the civilian leadership   At this critical time in both Iraq and Afghanistan  the Committee and the American people should hear not only from our military  s uniformed leaders but also from you as the top civilian leader          I hope you will reconsider your decision not to testify before the Committee on Thursday            I look forward to your response and thank you for your consideration           Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
