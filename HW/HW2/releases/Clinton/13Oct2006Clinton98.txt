October 13  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Congratulating Nobel Peace Prize Recipient Dr  Muhammad Yunus                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I want to congratulate Dr  Muhammad Yunus on winning this year  s Nobel Peace Prize  About twenty years ago  Dr  Yunus traveled to Arkansas to help Bill and me set up microcredit programs in the United States  Since that time  in my travels in Bangladesh and around the world  I have had the opportunity to meet many of those who are participants in Grameen  s programs and hear their stories of the ways in which these loans have transformed their lives  I continue to be inspired by the beneficial impact of these projects on low income women and their families  and I  like others  have nominated Dr  Yunus for this prize multiple times  With just a small amount of money  those trapped by poverty have a chance to invest in items  such as livestock or materials for handicrafts  which can lead to economic self sufficiency  Through microcredit programs  the world s poorest people are leading their families  their communities and their countries to a better future    a future that Dr  Yunus has been instrumental in creating  I would like to thank him for all his work  and congratulate him once again
