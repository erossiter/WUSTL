April 16  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on USDA to Respond to Widespread Concerns Over Nationwide Honeybee Decline                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Bee Colonies in New York State and Elsewhere Experiencing Rapid and Serious Collapse      Colony Collapse Disorder  has Potential to Impact New York s Honeybee Industry and Other Crop Production Such as Apples                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is expressing serious concerns over the rapid decline in honeybee colonies in New York State and nationwide  Joining a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in a letter to U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  Secretary Mike Johanns  Senator Clinton is asking the Secretary to provide answers on how the USDA is planning to address the increasingly threatening  colony collapse disorder   which has decimated bee colonies throughout the United States           The reports of this disorder demand a swift response to identify the causes of the problem that threatens to not only impact our bee and honey growers but our fruit growers as well  We must determine the appropriate response to restore the health of our beekeeping industry   said Senator Clinton   New York farmers know how crucial our agricultural economy is to our statewide economy  This disorder poses a serious threat to our farmers  our agricultural communities and our economy  We must act quickly to preserve and promote our beekeeping industry           Colony Collapse Disorder  CCD  is a new and unexplained condition that has caused some beekeepers to lose as much as 90 percent of their honeybee colonies  The enormous importance of honeybees  responsible for providing pollination to vital crops like apples  is valued at upwards of  14 billion nationally  according to a recent study by Cornell University           The effects of CCD are just as prevalent in the state of New York  According to New York honeybee producer James Doan  there have been reports of severe losses in colonies  with many losses being reported of close to fifty percent  and some beekeepers reporting losses of nearly eighty percent  Critical to New York s apple production  Doan reported in his testimony before a U S  House Committee earlier this year that there are concerns that the loss of bee colonies here in New York will not be able to be remediated in time for apple pollination  Some estimates have shown that nearly all the major beekeepers in the state of New York have lost more than 30 percent of their colonies to CCD          In their letter to Secretary Johanns  the Senators called on the Secretary to expedite a report on the steps the Department is and will plan to be taking to determine the causes of CCD  and to develop appropriate responses for the serious disorder  The Senators asked for an explanation as to how the Department plans to use its existing resources to work with other third party research enterprises to combat CCD and to outline the Department s long term plans to restore the health of the beekeeping industry across the United States          The full text of the Senators  letter to Secretary Johanns is as follows          The Honorable Michael Johanns  Secretary  U S  Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue SW  Washington  D C  20250 0003      Dear Mr  Secretary       America s beekeepers and their bees are an indispensable pillar of U S  Agriculture  Our nation s beekeepers provide essential pollination services for over 90 different food  seed and fiber crops  contributing over  14 billion of added agricultural value as documented by a Cornell University study in 2000  Crops that depend upon or benefit from honey bee pollination include alfalfa  almonds  apples  avocados  blueberries  cantaloupes  carrots  cherries  citrus  cotton  cranberries  kiwis  plums  pumpkins  seed crops  soybeans  squash  sunflowers and watermelons          As you are no doubt aware  a new and unexplained condition known as Colony Collapse Disorder   CCD   is decimating bee colonies through the United States  CCD is causing some beekeepers to lose upwards of 90 percent of their bee colonies  and is causing serious reductions in the supplies of bees for essential commercial pollination  These severe losses are in addition to other problems such as higher production costs  mite infestations and unfairly traded imports that have been making it very difficult for beekeepers to operate profitably  If these alarming trends are allowed to continue  they will place at risk in excess of  14 billion in annual U S  farm output that depends on bee pollination  Ultimately  the shortage of pollination services could impact the supply of healthful and affordable food for U S  consumers          We are writing on an urgent basis to ask that you provide us with an expedited report on the immediate steps that the Department is and will be taking to determine the causes of CCD  and to develop appropriate countermeasures for this serious disorder  In particular  we ask for a specific explanation of how the Department plans to utilize its existing resources and capabilities  including its four Agricultural Research Service honeybee research labs  and to work with other public and private sector enterprises in combating CCD  We also request that the Department identify any additional resources and capabilities that would be necessary or useful in its efforts to stop the spread of CCD          In addition  we would also ask that you outline the Department s long term plans to help restore the health of the U S  beekeeping industry  including implementation of a crop insurance program for beekeepers that Congress authorized in 2002           We look forward to receiving your report and any recommendations on this urgent matter for U S  agricultural producers and American consumers          Sincerely
