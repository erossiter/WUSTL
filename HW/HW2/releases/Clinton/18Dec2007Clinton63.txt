December 18  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the FCC Decision to Ease Media Cross Ownership Rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC  I am deeply disappointed by the FCC s decision to overturn longstanding media cross ownership rules  and to do so with a grossly flawed and widely criticized process  The FCC is now actively promoting industry consolidation  but it is not addressing serious questions about consumer choice and localism  The Commission acted without giving the public sufficient time to comment   And the Commission completely disregarded the concerns of a bipartisan group of more than 25 Senators who urged a more deliberative approach  In our letter to the Commission earlier this week  we made it clear that the Senate would move to nullify an FCC rulemaking that violated or short changed the public comment period  and which did not address the serious issues media consolidation raises  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues to respond to the FCCs unwise action
