                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Legislation would Modernize the Federal Housing Administration and Provide a Strong Alternative to Subprime and Risky Mortgages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC   Amid continuing deterioration in the subprime mortgage industry  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton reintroduced legislation to provide more homebuyers with a safer and more effective alternative to subprime mortgages   The 21st Century Housing Act will modernize the Federal Housing Administration and allow more homebuyers to take advantage of the FHA mortgage insurance program              With the meltdown in the subprime housing market  it is clear that there needs to be a real alternative for more working families who want to achieve the dream of home ownership without having to jeopardize their financial futures with a risky mortgage product   said Senator Clinton    Modernizing the FHA will be an effective way of providing that alternative and I will press in the Senate to take this long overdue step for our families   said Senator Clinton          The FHA was created during the darkest days of the Great Depression to serve working and low income families who were shut out of the conventional housing market and to stabilize local and regional housing markets in times of economic disruption   After more than 70 years  34 million families have realized the dream of homeownership through FHA            Today  FHA remains an industry leader in serving minority  first time  and low income homebuyers and continues to help people who do not qualify for prime mortgages to avoid risky and in some cases predatory mortgage products   For example  the rate of minority lending through FHA has grown to more than one in three mortgages backed by the FHA   However the FHA has been hampered by a lack of investment in personnel and technology infrastructure  and structural inefficiencies that have made it increasingly uncompetitive in many housing markets            Senator Clinton s bill would modernize the FHA and expand access to more homebuyers by                Allowing the FHA to make investments in both personnel and its information technology infrastructure to help meet the market demand for affordable mortgage products and work more efficiently with mortgage lenders and borrowers               Increasing the FHA s loan limits for housing in high cost areas which will help create more home buying opportunities in high cost of living states like New York so that working families don t get priced out of their own neighborhoods                Allowing the FHA to develop responsible  alternative mortgage products such as reduced down payments and longer term mortgages to meet the demand of lower and moderate income families            This legislation will strengthen FHA and make it a viable alternative to some of the riskier products that have been marketed to homebuyers   said Pat Vredevoogd Combs  President of the National Association of REALTORS         In a letter to Senator Clinton  John M  Robbins  Chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America said   We believe your bill will make the changes necessary to ensure that FHA continues its good work in partnership with the mortgage lending community to achieve our joint goal of providing affordable housing and financing           Since FHA works as a partner with the private market providing insurance for mortgages offered by conventional financial institutions  it is self sustaining through the income from mortgage insurance premiums paid by FHA borrowers   Moreover  with FHA backing  a homebuyer faces much lower monthly payments than they would face with a subprime mortgage   The FHA program costs nothing to the taxpayers as it returns money to the Treasury each year and has been remarkably successful in helping families buy a home   Senator Clinton s bill will update the FHA program to reflect the economic realities in the housing market and in high cost of living states and bring the program up to date for today s needs          In addition to modernizing the FHA  Senator Clinton has called for a series of steps to help address the crisis facing subprime mortgage holders   Senator Clinton outlined a plan to break down barriers to owning a home and build up protections against unfair and unscrupulous lending practices   Senator Clinton s plan will provide more borrowing options for lower income  minority and first time homebuyers before they sign on the dotted line  more information and safeguards against abuses when signing a mortgage  and smart reforms to reduce foreclosures               Read Senator Clinton s remarks on subprime lending to the National Community Reinvestment
