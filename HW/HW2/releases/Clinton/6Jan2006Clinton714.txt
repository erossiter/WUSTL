January 6  2006 Senator Clinton Calls on DEP to Confirm that Stabilization of Gilboa Dam will be done by the Spring of 2006                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      New York  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on the New York City Department of Environmental Protection  DEP  to confirm its goal for the stabilization of Gilboa Dam by Spring of 2006   Meeting this deadline depends greatly upon the DEP to install a notch in the dam wall  allowing the water to drain out of one side of the dam while creating a dry area to install the cable stabilization on the wall  Continuing her work in support of the communities around the dam  Senator Clinton wrote to the DEP  calling on them to make every effort to affirm that the February deadline for construction of the notch for cable anchoring improvements is met         My current concern is focused on the short term stabilization of the dam that is projected to begin in January   Senator Clinton said in her letter    As we are all aware  the dam does not currently meet New York State s safety standards   It is my understanding that  in order to successfully accomplish the short term cable anchoring improvements  construction of a notch in the dam wall has to be completed by the end of February   Should DEP fail to be successful in completing this first phase in the stabilization project  it will be another 7 10 months before DEP will be able to make another attempt at the notch          I am asking that DEP makes every effort to affirm that the February deadline for construction of the notch is met   Senator Clinton wrote    The citizens of the Schoharie Valley are justifiably concerned   Confirmation that this construction will be completed would quell the anxiety felt by our residents         In late November  Senator Clinton joined Congressman McNulty and Senator Schumer to request the immediate assistance of the Army Corps of Engineers in assessing the stability of the Gilboa Dam and plotting the course of action required for repairs  As a result  in early December  the U S  Army Corps of Engineers agreed to participate in planning and advisory meetings on the remediation and repair of the Gilboa Dam  http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 250243          A copy of the Senator s letter to the Department of Environmental Protection is attached         Ms  Emily Lloyd  Commissioner  Department of Environmental Protection  59 17 Junction Boulevard  10th Floor  Flushing  New York  11373         Dear Commissioner Lloyd        Thank you for the briefing that your staff provided to both Senator Schumer and my offices regarding the Gilboa Dam  as well as your follow up correspondence   As you are aware our offices have been in continued discussions regarding my concern with the reconstruction of the dam as well as the temporary cable anchor system that will be installed to provide added stability to the dam  reducing the risk for failure   As I understand it  the reconstruction of the dam is being moved up to 2007 2008 from the originally scheduled 2010 date   I thank you for recognizing the priority of this project and making the appropriate changes in the Department of Environmental Protection s  DEP  schedule        I commend the DEP for the manner in which it informed local residents of the situation  and for holding a series of meetings to try and calm the fears of local residents and to explain the time line for both short and long term remedies   Additionally  I am happy that the DEP is willing to be accessible to the localities and willing to attend any and all meetings that are held on this issue to assist the residents in gathering information        My current concern is focused on the short term stabilization of the dam that is projected to begin in January   As we are all aware  the dam does not currently meet New York State s safety standards   It is my understanding that  in order to successfully accomplish the short term cable anchoring improvements  construction of a notch in the dam wall has to be completed by the end of February   Should DEP fail to be successful in completing this first phase in the stabilization project  it will be another 7 10 months before DEP will be able to make another attempt at the notch        I am asking that DEP makes every effort to affirm that the February deadline for construction of the notch is met   The citizens of the Schoharie Valley are justifiably concerned   Confirmation that this construction will be completed would quell the anxiety felt by our residents         Pursuant to your December 23  2005 letter and the letter to Senator Schumer dated December 9  2005  DEP states that the reservoir will be lowered by withdrawing water via the Shandaken Tunnel as well as by the use of siphons withdrawing water from the reservoir to the Schoharie creek   I am reassured knowing that there are accessible  practical and effective alternatives methods for the lowering of the dam levels available for this project  I am encouraged by the many experts working on this assignment that DEP is committed to the timely completion of this project in the most efficient and effective manner  and that all resources available will be used to accomplish stabilization of the Dam        I am confident that the DEP will successful meet the February date for construction of the notch  allowing for the spring schedule to proceed for installation of the cable stabilization system   I know you share my concern for the people in Schoharie Valley  and in maintaining the integrity and security of the vital infrastructure that sustains New York City s extraordinary water supply system  I look forward to working with you  and other agencies in a collaborative fashion to address this situation in the most productive and expedited manner possible         Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
