September 6  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Mexican Trucking Pilot Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I am gravely concerned by the Bush administrations rash decision to press forward with its plan to allow Mexican trucking companies into the country   Earlier this year  I called on the administration to halt the program until numerous concerns with the program were adequately addressed   I also wrote a letter to Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters setting out my concerns with its pilot program and urging her to wait until the agency s Inspector General issued a report on the safety and security of the program   I noted in the letter that the Inspector General had already issued a report concluding that the administration had failed to meet a number of strict congressional regulations aimed at protecting the American public      Just weeks ago  the Inspector General issued yet another report concluding that there remain ongoing issues with the safety and the security of the pilot program    Nonetheless  the administration has chosen to push forward with the program in the face of these concerns   This decision once again reflects a disregard for the laws and the safety of our nation   The House of Representatives has passed legislation that strictly requires Mexican trucks to comply with the law before proceeding with the program and that blocks funding for the program altogether this year   In the coming days  I intend to work with my colleagues to find the best ways to address the many safety  security and environmental issues that remain with the program
