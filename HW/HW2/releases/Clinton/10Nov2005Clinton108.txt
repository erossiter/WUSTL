November 10  2005 Senator Clinton Calls on President Bush to Raise Human Rights Issues with Chinese Government During Visit to China                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Senator Makes Announcement at ABA International Rule of Law Symposium                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    During a keynote address at the American Bar Association International Rule of Law Symposium  Senator Clinton announced that she is sending a letter to President Bush urging him to raise critical human rights issues in his upcoming meetings with the Chinese government during his visit to the People  s Republic of China          Specifically  Senator Clinton encouraged the President in her letter to                     Make clear that the United States strongly opposes human rights abuses that have occurred as a result of China  s one child  policy  supports non coercive family planning programs  and wants China to end any population policies that violate human rights                   Emphasize the importance of freedom of religion and conscience  and to urge China to end any repressive practices                   Press China to respect the unique religious  linguistic  and cultural heritage of the Tibetan people and to fully respect their human rights and civil liberties                   Stress U S  concerns over China  s repression of workers   rights           The text of Senator Clinton  s letter to President Bush is below          Senator Clinton  s speech before the ABA symposium focused on the international        rule of law and promoting women  s rights   Noting that the rule of law    provides the foundation for democratic freedom  peace and stability  and economic growth     Senator Clinton applauded the symposium  s efforts to create an international rule of law movement   She noted that to keep such a movement moving forward for women  we must promote   education for all  so that women and men know their rights and are empowered to act on them   Better health care and law enforcement  so that women and men have the resources to keep themselves and their families healthy   And we need to keep fighting to end the scourge of trafficking in persons             Senator Clinton also stated that when   we talk about promoting the rule of law in other societies  we need to begin by recognizing that the United States has a special heritage and a special responsibility      From our own women  s rights movement to the shining examples of women like Rosa Parks  the U S  tradition of using the rule of law to right the wrongs of the law has inspired millions around the world               November 10  2005         The Honorable George Bush       President of the United States       Washington  D C  20500         Dear Mr  President                   This month you will visit the People  s Republic of China to meet with the leadership of that nation   These summit meetings provide an opportunity for the United States and China to discuss a wide range of important issues   During your meetings  I urge you to raise human rights issues with the Chinese government and emphasize that respect for human rights is a critically important element in the U S  China relationship   Specifically  I hope you will raise with the Chinese government the following points                   Since first introduced in 1979  China  s one child policy has evoked strong concern over human rights abuses   These abuses have reportedly included denial of social benefits  fines  detention  destruction of property  forced abortion and forced sterilization   Such practices reflect the fundamental injustice inherent in a system that interposes government in choices that should be made by women and their families   In 1995  as a participant in the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing  I heard first hand about these practices and spoke against them   In 2002  China enacted a Population and Family Planning Law aimed at ending human rights violations associated with the one child policy   However  the 2004 State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices suggests uneven Chinese enforcement of the law  with continuing use of psychological and economic pressure and threats to force women to terminate pregnancies or undergo sterilization   I urge you to make clear the United States strongly opposes these abuses  supports non coercive family planning programs  and wants China to end any population policies that violate human rights                   In addition  although the Chinese Constitution provides for freedom of religious belief  in reality the Government works to restrict religious practice to government sanctioned organizations and registered places of worship   Unregistered religious groups are subjected to varying levels of intimidation  harassment and detention   Since 1999  the Secretary of State has designated China as a   Country of Particular Concern    under the International Religious Freedom Act for its severe violations of religious freedom   You raised the issue of religious freedom during your December 2003 meeting with Premier Wen Jiabao and November 2004 meeting with President Hu Jintao   However  the 2005 State Department International Religious Freedom Report still rates China  s respect for freedom of religion and conscience as   poor    and the November 2005 U S  Commission on International Religious Freedom  s Policy Focus on China report found that   the Chinese government systematically violates the right to freedom of thought  conscience  and religion or belief  contravening both the Chinese constitution and international human rights norms      I ask you to raise this matter again with China  to emphasize the importance of freedom of religion and conscience  and to urge China to end any repressive practices                   As you know the United States continues to press China to respect the unique religious  linguistic  and cultural heritage of the Tibetan people and to fully respect their human rights and civil liberties   In 2001  I was pleased to co sponsor the Tibetan Policy Act to support substantive dialogue between the Government of the People  s Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his representatives and to strengthen the capacity of the United States Government to promote such dialogue   The United States has raised the issue of Tibet with China on a number of occasions  most recently during Secretary Rice  s July 2005 visit   I urge you to again bring this longstanding and pressing matter to the attention of China and to prompt them to achieve a fair resolution          Finally  regarding worker  s rights  eighteen months after rejecting the AFL CIO s Section 301 petition alleging China s repression of workers  rights was an unfair trade practice  the Bush Administration has yet to progress in raising the issue with China   The Chinese government has failed to make any significant reforms  either in its labor laws or enforcement practices   As the bilateral trade deficit with China soars  and American workers lose manufacturing jobs  employers take advantage of Chinese workers who cannot exercise their right to form independent unions and bargain   Unfortunately  the only concrete outcome of the high profile visit by Secretary Chao to China in the summer of 2004 was a series of letters pledging more seminars  high level visits  and dialogues on workplace issues  But this dialogue has yielded few  if any  tangible results  on issues of crucial importance  both to Chinese and American workers   U S  concerns over worker  s rights should be re emphasized during this summit                   I strongly support continuing efforts to improve the relationship on all levels between our country and China   It is to our mutual benefit to work together to address the range of challenges facing both of us   However  economic and social advances will be lasting only if they are built on a foundation of respect for human rights                    Thank you for your consideration            Sincerely              Hillary Rodham Clinton
