December 2  2005 Statement of Senator Clinton Regarding the Coast Guard Proposal to Realign Long Island Operations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I am greatly concerned that the Coast Guard s proposed consolidation will have a negative impact on the search and rescue functions for the south shore of Long Island  I am grateful that none of the physical assets of the Coast Guard Stations will be moving and the number of Coast Guard boats and Stations will be unaffected  However  moving a command center away from the area in which it is assigned to watch could seriously weaken its effectiveness  I will be working with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that the Coast Guard understands our concerns and remains vigilant in keeping Long Island and the rest of the coastline safe           The U S  Coast Guard recently announced a proposal to realign their Group Moriches  based in Moriches  Long Island as part of their plan to consolidate bases throughout the nation  relocating Search and Rescue  SAR  Command functions from Group Moriches to New Haven  CT  The move will entail a personnel shift of about 14 18 persons from Moriches for the purpose of consolidating the command center in New Haven
