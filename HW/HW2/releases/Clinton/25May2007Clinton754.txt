the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized defense and military construction funding for Telephonics  STIDD  Northrop Grumman  Truetech  ATK   Alliant Tech Systems  Precision Pharma  Frances Gabreski Air National Guard Base  and Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation  The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill            Our local research and development facilities are developing cutting edge technology in support of our troops but they are also critical for the local economy  As our troops continue to fight bravely overseas and to defend our nation  we know too well the importance of giving them the best equipment available  And these investments are always a welcome boost as we continue to promote Long Island as a center for research and New York s rightful place at the forefront of defense development and manufacturing   Senator Clinton said   I am also pleased that the Committee has approved  8 4 million for the construction of part one of the pararescue facility at Gabreski  It took an entire community to save the 106th and now we are investing in the facility s future           The Senator also announced that the bill included an amendment she offered that continues the fight to save the Naval Junior ROTC  NJROTC  programs for Southold  Mattituck  and Greenport High Schools  In 2006  Senator Clinton fought to include an amendment in the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Authorization Bill to force the Department of Defense to review a decision that would have led to the elimination of the programs  In response to the review  the Senator worked to include a new amendment in the Fiscal Year 2008 version of the bill to consider Southold  Mattituck  and Greenport High Schools as one institution for the purposes of the NJROTC program  In doing so  the schools will be able to maintain these programs           This is another important step in the battle to protect these local NJROTC programs   Senator Clinton said   These programs provide an excellent opportunity for young men and women to give back to their communities and I am very pleased that the committee agreed with me about the importance of keeping them alive for the students in Southold  Mattituck  and Greenport           Now that the authorization bill has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  the bill will be sent to the Senate floor          The bill also included two amendments that Senator Clinton proposed  including one that would protect financial benefits for military family members by closing gaps in coverage for Death Gratuity and Survivor Benefits beneficiaries and one that would expand and extend a Government Accountability Office  GAO  study to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the readiness of the Ground Forces within the Army and Marine Corps   The study would also assess the impact of the recent troop surge initiated by President Bush          Funding in the FY 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill for Long Island includes       Telephonics   Aircraft Wireless Intercom System  AWIS     5 million          Funding would provide a standardized Aircraft Wireless Intercom System  AWIS  for 500 aircraft within the Army National Guard UH 60 Blackhawk Fleet    In limited use by Army National Guard helicopters  AWIS has provided enhanced safety and communications linkage between flight crew  passengers and personnel on and off the aircraft during air and ground operations   AWIS can provide up to 1 500 feet of wireless communication capability that will allow personnel the freedom and safety to use both hands while performing in support of medical evacuation and emergency response missions in the US and worldwide       STIDD   Recon Navigation System  RNAV  for the Diver Propulsion Device  DPD     4 5 million         The Recon Navigation System  RNAV  is an innovative  mission essential equipment upgrade for the Army s fleet of Diver Propulsion Devices  DPD    Army DPDs are currently equipped with only an antiquated compass and depth gauge for navigation purposes   The RNAV offers Army Divers a precise  rugged  reliable underwater navigation and reconnaissance data collection system  mapping   which may be mounted in and powered by the DPDs onboard lithium ion battery system   Funding will provide US Army Divers a commercial off the shelf RNAV for the Army s entire fleet of DPDs  The funding directly supports a Department of the Army Required Capability Document  RCD  which requires an electronic reconnaissance and navigation system for the DPD       Northrop Grumman   AN SPQ 9B Radar for DDG 51 Modernization Program    6 million         The AN SPQ 9B radar provides early and reliable horizon surveillance including  detection of sea skimmer missiles at an ultra low false alarm rate  gunfire control against surface targets  and an aid to navigation   The DDG Modernization program is scheduled to deliver the first modernized ship  DDG 51  in FY10   Funding is needed to initiate AN SPQ 9B radar procurement now in order to make an AN SPQ 9B radar available for the program s in yard need date in the first quarter of FY2010       Truetech   M291 M295 Skin Equipment Chemical Decontamination    14 million         The M291 SDK is an effective and fielded chemical skin decontamination device for the U S  warfighter  This kit decontaminates skin from known nerve and blister agent threats without harming the skin   The patented absorbent and reactive resin technology used in the M291 and original M295 provides a unique system for the decontamination of chemical warfare agents   The technologically advanced polymeric absorbent  containing a bimodal pore system  provides for rapid absorption of chemical agents from skin  effectively sequestering the agent and preventing skin penetration   This funding would be used to sustain current operations for the M291 SDK and to conduct a pilot to renew the M295 equipment decontamination kit as it was originally developed using M291 SDK technology       ATK   Alliant Tech Systems   X 51B Robust Scramjet Research    3 5 million  The X 51B flight test vehicle is being designed as a robust  affordable hypersonic technology test bed to ultimately provide a low cost path to a near term hypersonic weapon system and support far term space access technology development   FY2008 AFRL X 51B Robust Scramjet Funding will ensure that the Department of Defense is positioned to develop future high speed aircraft  time critical strike weapons  and global reach strike platforms       Precision Pharma   Fibrin Adhesive Stat  FAST  Dressing    2 million         The FAST Dressing is the only wound dressing that is effective against all kinds of blood loss including severe arterial and venous bleeding  Funding is needed to develop the manufacturing process for the dressing and to test the product in order to apply for FDA permission to conduct clinical studies       Microelectronics Advanced Research Corporation   Semiconductor Focus Center Research Program    5 million         The Focus Center Research Program  FCRP  is jointly funded by the Department of Defense and the semiconductor industry to perform basic research at 38 universities across the country  including Columbia  Cornell  NYU  RPI  Stony Brook and the University at Albany SUNY  Funding is used to help maintain U S  leadership in semiconductor technology that is critical for national defense and economic competitiveness   Technology leadership is also important to the many upstream companies that supply the semiconductor industry and the computer and telecommunications equipment companies that depend on semiconductor advances       Frances Gabreski Air National Guard Base    Pararescue Facility    8 4 million         Funding would support the construction of part one of the Pararescue Facility at the Francis S  Gabreski Airport in Westhampton Beach  NY   In April 2004 as a result of unit reorganization  the 106th Air Rescue Wing manning more than doubled   Special requirements that could not be accommodated under the old organization were now severely strained   Space is required to perform pre mission planning and training so that missions can be successfully executed without endangering crew members during challenging and high risk missions
