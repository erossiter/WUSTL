November 15  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Canandaigua VA Local Advisory Panel Meeting Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton submitted the following statement to the Canandaigua VA Local Advisory Panel meeting today            November 15  2006      Mr  Jay Halpern  Designated Federal Officer  United States Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20420      Dear Mr  Halpern     Statement for the Record of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Local Advisory Panel Meeting to Discuss the Future of the Canandaigua VA Medical Center      I am pleased that the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA   after time lag of over a year  is finally meeting with the Canandaigua Local Advisory Panel to receive input on the five remaining business plan options for the Canandaigua VA Medical Center   While I was happy to learn last month that the five remaining options retain nearly all of the services currently provided on the Canandaigua campus  it has been 15 months since the VA last consulted with the Local Advisory Panel  LAP   and I am concerned that our veterans have not had a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard   The LAP process is designed to insure that the input of veterans is taken into account before making decisions that directly affect the health care needs of thousands of veterans in New York and around the nation            Looking ahead  it is essential that the VA re commit to fully engaging local veterans and community leaders before making any final plans for Canandaigua   In particular  it would be premature for the VA to close the remaining acute inpatient psychiatric beds located at Canandaigua before a final decision on the various options for the facility has been made   Only by listening to our veterans and understanding their needs can we effectively follow through on our national promise that those who serve will have access to first rate health care at VA facilities          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
