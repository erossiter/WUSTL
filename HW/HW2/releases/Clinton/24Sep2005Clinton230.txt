September 24  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the International Freedom Center                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             While I want to ensure that development and rebuilding in Lower Manhattan move forward expeditiously  I am troubled by the serious concerns that family members and first responders have expressed to me   The LMDC has authority over the site  and I do not believe we can move forward until it heeds and addresses their concerns    Therefore  I cannot support the IFC
