                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Calls on President s Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health to Recommend Approval of Special Cohort to Compensate Former Nuclear Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today submitted testimony to a meeting of the Presidents Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  which was meeting to consider a special exposure cohort petition for Bethlehem Steel Workers  Senator Clinton has long fought to establish a special cohort for former Bethlehem Steel employees and urged the Presidents Advisory Board recommend approval of the petition  The Board could make a decision about the petition as soon as today    At a meeting of the Presidents Advisory Board earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined Representatives Brian Higgins  Louise Slaughter  Thomas Reynolds and Senator Charles E  Schumer in calling on them to recommend approval of the petition by former Bethlehem Steel workers to create a Special Exposure Cohort for those who worked in Bethlehem Steel s nuclear weapons program during the Cold War  Approval of this petition would make the former nuclear workers eligible to receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program if exposure records do not allow case by case decisions to be made    Senator Clinton is also a sponsor of legislation to reform the compensation program for nuclear workers at Bethlehem Steel and other former New York atomic weapons production facilities  The bill would enable employees to be added to a special exposure cohort and receive compensation under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program if exposure records do not enable case by case decisions to be made   Senator Clinton has also called on the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  of which she is a member  to hold a hearing on the Administrations failure to properly implement the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000  EEOICPA       A copy of Senator Clintons testimony is below      Written Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Behalf of Special Cohort Status for Bethlehem Steel Workers  Presidents Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health  July 18  2007   The Presidents Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health has the authority and responsibility to oversee the work the agencies that implement the Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program  One of the boards specific responsibilities is to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services about whether to approve special exposure cohort petitions that have been referred by NIOSH   You have such a petition before you today for a class of workers at Bethlehem Steel   I urge you to recommend approval of the petition      Like workers at many other sites around New York and our country  Bethlehem Steel employees were essential to our Cold War effort  These people literally built our nuclear arsenal in the decades after World War II and helped us eventually to win the Cold War  In the late 40s and early 50s  the government contracted with Bethlehem Steel to roll uranium at their plant  But the workers werent told what they were working with  They werent provided with safety equipment to shield them from radiation  They werent monitored to determine how much radiation they were being exposed to     Many of these workers subsequently got cancer  And for decades they petitioned their government for help and have been denied  Congress finally did the right thing in 2000 with the act that you are part of administering  This was a landmark law and it was such in the tradition of our country to acknowledge the wrong that the government had done  and promise timely compensation to workers and their survivors     When Congress passed the law in 2000  it recognized that reconstructing doses would be impossible in many cases and thats why the special cohort process was included in the law  The statute to my reading is pretty clear  It says that if the government doesnt have the information to reconstruct doses then workers should be given the benefit of the doubt and their claims should be paid  More precisely it provides for classes of workers to be added to a special exposure cohort if its not feasible to estimate the radiation doses with sufficient accuracy  and there is reasonable likelihood that the radiation dose may have endangered their health     I dont think we could have a clearer case than Bethlehem Steel where not a single worker wore a radiation badge  where the only radiation measurements we have are a handful of air samples  where the workers rolled uranium and where many of them contracted radiation related cancers     I have introduced legislation with Senator Schumer that would require approval of special exposure cohorts in such cases  as I believe the original statute requires   But I appeal to you today to bring the Bethlehem Steel process to a conclusion by recommending approval of the petition   Thank you
