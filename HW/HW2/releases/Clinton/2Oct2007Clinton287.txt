October 2  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Department of Energy Decision to Designate Mid Atlantic Electricity Transmission Corridor                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Todays decision by the Department of Energy opens the door for NYRI to make an end run around the states rigorous review and siting process  The NYRI project has the potential to impact so many New York communities along the proposed route  and their serious concerns should not be ignored or overridden   I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that New York communities are heard  and that New York has the final word  Senator Clinton said    The Department of Energy announced today the designation of a Mid Atlantic National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor  NIETC  that includes the area in which the proposed NYRI project would be located  Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005  Congress authorized the Department of Energy to designate NIETCs in congested areas of the high voltage power grid The law also granted the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  new authority to permit construction of transmission lines in the designated NIET corridors to companies like NYRI   The most problematic provision of that law gives power line permit holders  like NYRI  the right to petition in U S  district court to acquire rights of way for the construction of transmission lines through the power of eminent domain  Under current law  a project such as NYRI would be allowed to use the new federal right of eminent domain to condemn private property along its route between Utica and Orange County   Earlier this year  Senator Clinton joined with Senator Schumer in introducing legislation to fix the law in order to give New York and other states the final say on siting of power lines
