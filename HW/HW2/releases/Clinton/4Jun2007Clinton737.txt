June 4  2007 Clinton Calls for Hearing on Bush Administration s Implementation of Program to Compensate Former Nuclear Workers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                News Reports Suggest Workers Compensation Claims for Energy Workers Being Mismanaged and Attempts Being Made to Restrict Payouts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  of which she is a member  to hold a hearing on the Administrations failure to properly implement the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000  EEOICPA   Recent reports have highlighted Administration efforts to limit compensation for former nuclear workers  like those at Bethlehem Steel and other former nuclear processing sites in New York  In a letter  co signed by a bi partisan group of Senators  Clinton and her colleagues pointed out that implementation of EEOICPA by the Department of Labor  DOL  and the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  has come under significant scrutiny in recent months due to delays in processing cases  denial of a high percentage of workers claims  and allegations that the Administration has limited payouts as a means of cutting costs     I have repeatedly urged this Administration to compensate claimants at Bethlehem Steel through a  special exposure cohort   The law is clear that when the Administration lacks the information necessary to estimate radiation doses  then they should award compensation through this cohort process  Recent reports suggest that the problems encountered at Bethlehem Steel are symptomatic of problems with the program nationwide  and I hope we will be able to conduct oversight hearings on this important issue  Senator Clinton said  The workers at these facilities were essential to our cold war efforts and were exposed to hazardous materials without their knowledge and without adequate protections  It is past time to provide justice for Bethlehem Steel claimants and other former nuclear workers across the country    The EEOICPA was created to provide compensation and medical care to workers who contracted radiation induced cancers and other medical problems while working on cold war nuclear weapons projects  Claims are decided by the Department of Labor  DOL  and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  by using available records about work conditions and employment history  Using these records  NIOSH estimates the radiation doses received by each worker and then determines whether that radiation exposure was more likely than not to have caused the workers illness  Because of several instances where data and work records failed to be maintained or created  the process by which claims are handled has come under increased scrutiny lately  According to a recent report in the Washington Post  see   Thousands of Nuclear Arms Workers See Cancer Claims Denied or Delayed by Michael Alison Chandler and Joby Warrick   the lack of appropriate data has resulted in thousands of claims being denied or subject to excessive delays     This is yet another step in Senator Clintons continued efforts to alleviate the problems that the EEOICPA compensation claims have encountered  Senator Clinton has repeatedly called for special exposure cohort status for the nuclear workers at Bethlehem Steel and is the author of legislation to amend the criteria by which employees can be added to a special exposure cohort  This status would expedite the claims from Bethlehem Steel workers by stating that when monitoring data is lacking  workers should be given the benefit of the doubt and compensated if they have a radiation related illness and worked 250 days at the site     A copy of the letter sent by Senator Clinton along with Senator Brown and other colleagues follows    June 4  2007   The Honorable Edward M  Kennedy Chairman Senate Committee on Health  Education   Labor and Pensions 428 Senate Dirksen Office Building Washington  DC 20510   The Honorable Michael B  Enzi Ranking Member Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions 379A Senate Russell Office Building Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi    We are writing to request that the Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions hold a hearing on the Administrations implementation of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act of 2000  EEOICPA      Congress created EEOICPA to provide appropriate compensation and medical benefits to workers who contracted radiation induced cancers  beryllium diseases  or silicosis during the course of their work for the Department of Energy or its contractors  However  implementation of EEOICPA by the Department of Labor  DOL  and the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  has come under significant scrutiny in recent months due to delays in processing cases  denial of a high percentage of workers claims  and allegations that the Administration has limited payouts as a means of cutting costs  As a result  nuclear weapons workers with work related diseases in 20 states are not being compensated  although they have filed claims     EEOICPA was designed to fairly compensate sick energy workers  Where radiation dose cannot be estimated due to the governments inability to maintain or create records of workers radiation exposure levels  EEOICPA allows workers with cancer to petition to receive special exposure cohort  SEC  status and secure compensation  without dose reconstruction  if their cancer is among a list of cancers specified within the original law  Energy workers from at least 13 sites from 11 states  representing thousands of workers  have petitions for SEC status pending  The Department of Health and Human Services has been slow to consider petitions and places high burdens on petitioners seeking to be added to the SEC     A front page story from the May 12  2007 Washington Post highlighted these problems  We have enclosed a copy of this article for your reference    We strongly urge the Committee to hold a hearing on the implementation of EEOICPA during this legislative session and we offer our support in finding solutions to the problems identified above     Sincerely
