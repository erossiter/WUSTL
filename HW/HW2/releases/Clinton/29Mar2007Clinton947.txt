                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Joined by Wounded Soldier  Caregivers  Advocates for Military Families  Medical Experts       Washington  DC   Today on Capitol Hill  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  joined with advocates for wounded soldiers and their families to announce a new legislative initiative  co sponsored by Senator Susan Collins  R ME   to improve the detection  assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury and expand support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and their families   Senator Clinton also announced introduction of legislation to help ensure wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits   Senator Clinton was joined by Sergeant Ted Wade U S Army 82nd Airborne Division  who incurred a severe traumatic brain injury and his wife Sarah Wade of Chapel Hill  NC  Lee Woodruff  TBI caregiver and co author with husband Bob Woodruff of New York Times bestseller In An Instant  Dr  Bert Vargas  a resident at New York University School of Medicine who served as an Air Force flight surgeon in Iraq and leadership from the Wounded Warrior Project  the Military Officers Association of America  the National Military Family Association  the Brain Injury Association of America and the American Academy of Neurology               If you serve your country your country must serve you   This is the promise our country must keep to the men and women who enlist  who fight and who return home often bearing the visible and invisible scars of sacrifice   We have a duty to reform and ready the military for the increasing number of veterans suffering from complex injuries like traumatic brain injury   Today we are taking steps needed to ensure our men and women in uniform and their families have the care and support they need and deserve   said Senator Clinton           Senator Clinton today introduced legislation to build on the groundbreaking  Heroes at Home  initiative she authored and secured in law last year aimed at helping U S  troops and their families to transition after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan and get the help they need with readjustment to work and coping with post traumatic stress disorder and TBI   Today  Senator Clinton announced a new initiative to expand Heroes at Home by               Improving the screening process for our troops before deployment to improve TBI diagnoses after deployment   Traumatic brain injury  which affects approximately one out of every 10 returning servicemembers  has been identified as the  signature wound  affecting soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan   Multiple deployments and prevalent use of IEDs have put servicemembers at increased risk of sustaining more than one mild or moderate TBI   However  mild and moderate TBI may go undetected  especially if a servicemember has sustained more obvious injuries   It also can be difficult to distinguish mild TBI from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder since both conditions have common symptoms  such as irritability  anxiety and depression   Senator Clinton s bill will improve detection of mild and moderate TBI by implementing an objective  computer based assessment protocol to measure cognitive functioning both prior to and after deployment   Senator Clinton s bill will require that the same assessment tool be used across all branches of the Armed Services and for every member of the Armed Forces who will be deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan               Helping families struggling to take care of a loved one with training and certification for dealing with brain injuries and psychological injuries   Family members of returning soldiers with TBI are often ill equipped to handle the demands of caring for their loved one  which in some bases can become a full time responsibility   Senator Clinton s bill will establish a Traumatic Brain Injury Family Caregiver Personal Care Attendant Training and Certification Program  which would train and certify family caregivers of TBI patients as personal care attendants  enabling them to provide quality care at home and at the same time qualify for compensation from the VA                 Expanding Access to Needed Care   Servicemembers and veterans continue to face problems in accessing needed medical and mental health care  especially veterans or Guard and Reserve members who live in rural areas   Senator Clinton s bill will help increase the reach of needed care for TBI by expanding use of telehealth and telemental health services   Senator Clinton s bill will create a demonstration project  administered jointly by the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs that would use telehealth technology to assess TBI and related mental health conditions and facilitate rehabilitation and dissemination of educational material on techniques  strategies and skills for servicemembers with TBI           The proposals in this legislation were built on the recommendations of family caregivers now tending to the wounds of their loved ones who have incurred Traumatic Brain Injuries on our nation s behalf  Senator Clinton and the Wounded Warrior Project have listened to these families and their requests for help and we applaud her for her leadership on this legislation  We stand committed to assisting the Senator in seeing this bill through to enactment   said John Melia  Executive Director of the Wounded Warrior Project           The Heroes at Home Act of 2007 is endorsed by the Wounded Warrior Project  National Military Families Association  Military Officers Association of America  American Academy of Neurology and Brain Injury Association of America          Senator Clinton today also announced introduction of legislation to help ensure wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits               Restoring Disability Benefits for Injured and Wounded Warriors Act of 2007   Following up on complaints she heard from New York soldiers at Walter Reed about widespread problems with disability claims  Senator Clinton today introduced legislation that will restore disability benefits for wounded and injured members of the Armed Forces   The act will direct reviews of disability claims  traumatic injury claims and the Physical Evaluation Board process  and re open cases that warrant an increased disability benefit rating or traumatic injury payment   In addition  the bill will increase the availability of legal counsel for members appealing their disability cases  and direct the GAO to investigate efforts currently being made by the Department of Defense to address deficiencies in the Disability Evaluation Systems  the adequacy of the Department of Veterans Affairs Disability Schedule for Ratings as it relates to the nature of wounds our warriors suffer in combat today  and to report on the standards and procedures of Physical Evaluation Boards               Protecting Military Family Financial Benefits Act of 2007   Senator Clinton also introduced legislation that will protect financial benefits for military family members by closing gaps in coverage for Death Gratuity and Survivor Benefits beneficiaries and improve pre deployment counseling and services for all members of the Armed Forces   Everyday single parents deploy to distant battlefields and leave their minor children in the care of a financially ill prepared guardian or caretaker   Unfortunately  when tragedy strikes and a military servicemember makes the ultimate sacrifice  minor dependent children and families are excluded from receiving benefits and entitlements   In too many cases  pre deployment systems and processes designed to protect military family financial benefits are under resourced or not available and create unnecessary burden for survivors   Senator Clinton s bill will require each military service to provide adequate pre deployment counseling and services to every deploying member of the Armed Forces to ensure that families and dependents receive survivor benefits and entitlements            These bills are supported by the Wounded Warrior Project  National Military Families Association  Military Officers Association of America  American Legion and the Gold Star Mothers           As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need   She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform   She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing  recently released by the Army showing continuing problems  Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need   She has also secured in law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families
