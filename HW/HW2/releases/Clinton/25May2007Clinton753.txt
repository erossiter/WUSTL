May 25  2007 Clinton Announces Senate Committee Approval of Measures to Support Our Troops and Military Families                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Clinton Amendments to Expand GAO Assessment of Military Readiness and Close a Loophole in Financial Benefits for Military Family Members Included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill Approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee has approved two measures that she proposed to take care of our troops and military families  The provisions were included in the FY 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill           Now that the authorization bill has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  the bill will be sent to the Senate floor          Senator Clinton secured committee approval of an amendment that will protect financial benefits for military family members by closing gaps in coverage for Death Gratuity and Survivor Benefits beneficiaries           Unfortunately  when tragedy strikes and a military service member makes the ultimate sacrifice  minor dependent children and families are excluded from receiving benefits and entitlements  In too many cases  pre deployment systems and processes designed to protect military family financial benefits are under resourced or not available and create unnecessary burden for survivors   Senator Clinton said   I am very pleased that the committee agrees with me that we must close this gaping hole in the current survivor benefits program  This is the least we can do for those families whose loved one has made the ultimate sacrifice           Senator Clinton also secured committee approval of a provision that would expand and extend a Government Accountability Office  GAO  study to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the readiness of the ground forces within the Army and Marine Corps   The study would also assess the impact of the recent troop surge initiated by President Bush           I remain concerned about the continued strain on the ground forces and their ability to continue as rigorously as they have been these past few years   Senator Clinton said    The troop surge that the President has implemented adds to the pressure already on our military   A comprehensive inspection of the readiness of our troops must be made to assess the impact this surge has had   We must continue to focus on recruiting and retaining our forces  and on training and equipping them in a manner that ensures their safety and their ability to face whatever challenges arise   As our men and women in uniform remain in harm s way  we owe it to them to have a candid discussion and a comprehensive analysis of their readiness           The Senator s amendment is aimed at providing additional transparency of the true readiness of the military  to better identify where Congress can help focus its efforts            Last year the Senator secured an amendment in the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Authorization Bill to require that the GAO               Assess trained and ready forces for ongoing operations as well as future requirements                Assess the availability and readiness of equipment for training and ongoing operations                Review current personnel tempo with a particular focus on deployment and retention rates for both unusually high and low demand skills                Evaluate service efforts to mitigate high personnel operational tempos  and               Describe current reserve component mobilization policy with an analysis of projected future availability           The amendment approved today would extend the GAO s assessment while also expanding it to assess the impact of the troop surge          The FY 2008 Department of Defense  DoD  Authorization bill also contained funding to benefit many areas of New York  including
