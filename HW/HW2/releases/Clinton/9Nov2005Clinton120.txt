November 9  2005 Senator Clinton Urges Conferees to Adopt Privacy Protections in Senate Version of USA Patriot Act Reauthorization Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Safeguards Protect Against Abuse of Power to Obtain Ordinary Americans   Personal Records                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    As House and Senate conferees prepare to reconcile each chamber  s version of the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill  Senator Clinton today urged her colleagues to adopt safeguards in the Senate version of the bill that would help minimize the abuse of National Security Letters  NSLs   a tool that allows law enforcement to obtain ordinary Americans   personal records in national security cases   The USA PATRIOT Act greatly expanded the scope of NSLs and significantly lowered the standards for their issuance   In a letter to House and Senate conferees  Senator Clinton underscored that  while NSLs are an important tool in our fight against terrorism  their unfettered and unchecked use makes them susceptible to abuse that impedes the privacy of innocent people   The Senate version of the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill creates important checks on the power to issue and enforce NSLs without hindering the efficacy of this law enforcement tool           The following is the text of the letter from Senator Clinton to House and Senate conferees          Dear Conferees          On October 18  2005  I joined several of my colleagues in asking conferees reconciling the House and Senate versions of the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill to adopt the safeguards provided for in the Senate version of the bill   The Senate version of the bill strikes the proper balance between giving law enforcement the tools it needs to effectively combat terrorism and respecting the privacy rights of innocent Americans   An article appearing in the Sunday  November 6  2005 edition of The Washington Post brought to light a very troubling practice by the Federal Bureau of Investigation  FBI  that underscores the importance of adopting the protections spelled out in the Senate bill           National Security Letters  NSLs  are non judicial administrative subpoenas which allow the FBI to obtain ordinary Americans   personal records under strict confidentiality requirements in national security cases   NSLs are issued by FBI field supervisors  and their issuance requires neither the authorization nor approval of a judge  grand jury or prosecutor   While the FBI has long employed NSLs  the USA PATRIOT Act greatly expanded their scope  significantly lowering the standard for their issuance   The result has been  according to The Washington Post  a   hundredfold increase    in their use  with the FBI annually issuing 30 000 National Security Letters  NSLs  demanding private information about ordinary Americans not necessarily suspected of any crime   These records include financial  library  credit card  telephone  internet service provider  and email records as well as customer transaction information             While NSLs can be an important tool in our fight against terrorism  their unfettered and unchecked use makes them susceptible to abuse that infringes the privacy of innocent people   The Senate version of the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill creates important checks on the power to issue and enforce NSLs without hindering the efficacy of this law enforcement tool   Importantly  the Senate bill amends the confidentiality provisions of 18 U S C  2709 to permit recipients to disclose to those necessary for compliance and to an attorney for legal advice  something that was previously prohibited   The Senate bill also adopts important judicial checks on NSLs  amending 18 U S C  2709 to permit a motion to quash or modify an NSL in district court  and permitting a district court to modify or quash NSLs under 18 U S C  2709 if compliance would be unreasonable  oppressive  or violate any constitutional or other legal right or privilege   Importantly  the Senate bill also permits a district court to modify NSL confidentiality restrictions under 18 U S C  2709 if there is no reason to believe disclosure will endanger national security  or interfere with an investigation or diplomatic relations  or endanger a life            While we all recognize the importance of equipping our law enforcement with the tools they need to effectively combat terrorism  we also need to ensure that those tools are administered in a manner that does not unnecessarily restrict the freedom and liberty that are the hallmark of American life   I believe that the Senate version of the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization bill creates much needed accountability in the administration and issuance of NSLs  and I encourage you to adopt the protections provided therein            Sincerely         Hillary Rodham Clinton
