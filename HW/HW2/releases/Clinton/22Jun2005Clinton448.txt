June 22  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Proposed Constitutional Amendment to Ban Flag Desecration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As I have said in the past  I support federal legislation that would outlaw flag desecration  much like laws that currently prohibit the burning of crosses  but I don t believe a constitutional amendment is the answer         Burning or destroying an American flag is a despicable act that disrespects the sacrifices of our brave veterans and soldiers who fought to protect the very freedom of speech that flag burners exploit  I find this abhorrent and will endeavor to make sure our laws reflect this  Thankfully  we are fortunate that flag desecration is rare  As offensive as each act of desecration is  amending our Constitution should be a rare and extreme measure  which we should only resort to when all legislative options have been exhausted  Those few who would destroy a flag are not worthy of the response of amending our founding document         I know that for millions of Americans who proudly wore the uniform of our country in past years and for our brave men and women currently serving and fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan  our flag is a constant reminder of all of their sacrifices  One of the freedoms our soldiers sacrifice to defend is the right of all Americans to speak freely        When I ran for the Senate in 2000  I stated my opposition to amending the Constitution  When I began my service as Senator  I promised to consider carefully the arguments in favor of this Amendment  I appreciate all the New Yorkers  especially the veterans  whom I represent  who took the time to express their feelings         People feel passionately about this issue  and I have listened carefully and weighed the arguments  At the end of the day  I remain committed to the principle that we should not change the most fundamental and enduring framework of our democracy to respond to the reprehensible actions of a few who fail to honor the blessings of liberty
