June 6  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on CDC to Immediately Implement Better Communication Systems for Combating Tuberculosis                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senate Hearing Today Continues to Raise Questions About Failures to Monitor  Treat and Control Diseases like Drug Resistant TB                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on Dr  Julie Gerberding  Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   to immediately develop protocols to guide the actions of national  state and local health officials when suspected cases of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis  XDR TB  or multidrug resistant tuberculosis  MDR TB  arise  In sending her letter to Dr  Gerberding today  the Senator drew attention to the continuing lack of clear answers from government agencies tasked with dealing with this kind of health crisis  a problem which was only affirmed by testimony before a hearing today of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  and Related Agencies  This recent case of XDR TB has shed a glaring light on how our public health departments identify  monitor and treat the disease and todays Senate hearing again raised more questions than it provided answers  Diagnosis  treatment and education regarding XDR TB requires a unified national response  involving the CDC partnering not only with its public health colleagues at the state and local level  but also with other federal agencies that help to protect our nations health  We must fix the communications breakdown  Senator Clinton said  We need to ensure that our state and local public health departments have the resources they need to respond in the case of a crisis  It is obviously past time for the CDC to develop a clear protocol for state and local health officials to follow when cases of XDR TB and MDR TB are suspected  Senator Clintons letter comes in addition to her recent sponsorship of the Stop Tuberculosis  TB  Now Act of 2007  and the Comprehensive TB Elimination Act of 2007  legislation aimed at preventing further cases of TB and fighting the disease on a global and a national scale  From 1993 to 2006  there were 49 reported cases of XDR TB in the United States  more than half of which occurred in New York State  Globally  almost 40 countries have reported cases of XDR TB to the World Health Organization  In 2006  more than 13 000 cases of active tuberculosis were reported in the U S  Senator Clintons letter to Dr  Gerberding follows      June 6  2007  Julie Louise Gerberding  M D   M P H  Director  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Department of Health  Human Services 1600 Clifton Road  N W  Atlanta  Georgia 30329  Dear Dr  Gerberding   The recent  well publicized case of Andrew Speakers extensively drug resistant tuberculosis  XDR TB  discovered in the United States has raised awareness about this disease and the ways in which it is monitored and treated and controlled by our public health departments  Like you  I am gravely concerned by the public health threat posed by both XDR TB and multidrug resistant tuberculosis  MDR TB   and I believe the events of the past few weeks should spur you to make improvements in our public health infrastructure  particularly in the areas of coordination between federal  state and local health departments and between the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  and other federal agencies that play a role in protecting public health  Your testimony and the testimony of others  including Mr  Speaker  before the Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  and Related Agencies of the Senate Appropriations Committee only raises more questions about significant breakdowns in communication that occurred with this case  Although both XDR TB and MDR TB make up less than 2  of the over 13 000 cases of tuberculosis reported in the United States on an annual basis  they present a grave public health threat  Tuberculosis used to be a leading cause of death in the United States  With the advent of antibiotics  our health care providers were largely able to treat and cure this condition through regimens that involved months of treatment  However  the rise of MDR TB in the 1990s challenged our clinical protocols  requiring treatment protocols that are roughly twice as long as those necessary for non drug resistant TB  thus increasing concerns around adherence to regimens  The treatment outlook for XDR TB is even more complicated  Less than 1 3 of those infected with this type of tuberculosis are expected to be cured  If we do not take steps to address both MDR TB and XDR TB  we may once again face a situation where tuberculosis is a leading cause of death in our nation  I am particularly concerned about this disease because of its disproportionate impact on New York  Of the 49 cases of XDR TB that have been identified in the United States since 1993  more than half were identified in New York State or New York City  Indeed  the work done by health care professionals in New York City was critical in assessing the risks presented by the most recent case of XDR TB    In the face of antibiotic resistance  we must rely on early diagnosis  rigorous infection control practices  and strong public awareness campaigns to limit the spread of XDR TB  I understand that most cases of tuberculosis infection are handled at the state or local level  and that the CDC only become involved when greater expertise is needed  However  I believe that we need to ensure that state and local health departments are able to handle cases appropriately from the moment that they are identified as XDR TB  To date  only about 10 states have reported cases of XDR TB  and as you know  there is much misinformation about the condition  We should never again have a situation where delays in communication between the CDC and other domestic public health officials lead to needless exposure and risk  I would urge you to develop a protocol based upon our best available knowledge to guide the actions of state and local health officials that clearly delineates the actions that should be taken when suspected cases of MDR TB or XDR TB appear    Such action would be in keeping with global efforts to improve response to this condition  In October 2006  the World Health Organization  WHO  Global Task Force on Tuberculosis released 9 recommendations for addressing XDR TB around the world  Several of those recommendations address actions that can and should be taken at the country level  including management of patients  strengthening of laboratory capacity  and enhancement of advocacy  communication and social mobilization efforts  I know that you are very familiar with those recommendations  and according to the March 23  2007  edition of the CDCs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report  the Federal Tuberculosis Task Force is working on a response to both the domestic and global epidemics  I also understand that senior level officials are working on an interagency response  which is particularly important given the fact that lack of interagency collaboration and communication has been identified as a problem in this particular case  I would ask that you provide me with an update on the work of both the Task Force and the interagency response  with a focus on the following questions  1  In what ways is the United States using the WHO recommendations to guide its response to the epidemic  What is the timeline for implementing such recommendations to address domestic preparedness for XDR TB  2  How are you working with state and local health departments to ensure that there exists adequate capacity at all levels of government to diagnosis and properly treat MDR TB and XDR TB  Thank you for your attention to this issue  I look forward to working with you to improve our local  state and federal response to all forms of tuberculosis   Sincerely yours   Hillary Rodham Clinton
