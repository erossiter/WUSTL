2006      Thank you  Mr  Chairman   Well  I join both Senator Levin and Senator Kennedy    and I m sure to follow Senator Byrd    in expressing our deep concerns about this decision          The CFIUS process has been subject to several critical reports in the last several years  most recently a GAO report last fall which pointed out one of its failures was its inability to focus effectively on national security issues as the statute establishing CFIUS intended  it to do          This particular decision by CFIUS raises a number of red flags   And the reaction that has been forthcoming by people throughout our country I think is understandable for three reasons          First  we know from the work of the 9 11 Commission and other expert commissions that port security is one of our weak links   We have not funded it adequately  we have not taken it seriously   That s a particular concern to me as a senator from New York          Secondly  we know from the press reports    and I assume we ll get additional information from this briefing    that the process used to review this transaction appears to be cursory at best          A number of provisions were not required of the company   And it appears similarly that the mandatory requirement for an additional 45 day review when the entity involved is government owned was ignored          Thirdly  the track record of this administration on homeland security  its inadequate funding  its bureaucratic dysfunction at the Department of Homeland Security  as evidenced most tragically in Katrina  but in many other similar instances over the last four and a half years  does not create an atmosphere of confidence when looking at this particular matter          Moreover  according to the Associated Press  this transaction was approved without many of the ordinary conditions that are placed on such investments          The administration did not require Dubai Ports to keep copies of business records on U S  soil where they would be subject to court orders   It did not require the company to designate an American citizen to accommodate U S  government requests          If 9 11 was a failure of imagination and Katrina was a failure of initiative  this process is a failure of judgment   In the post 9 11 world  port security is too important an issue to be treated so cavalierly          Only 5 percent of the cargo entering the United States is inspected   Every expert whose reports I have read suggests we should be closer to 15 percent to 20 percent          We have not yet deployed the kind of technology that everyone knows we need to   We do not yet have the radiation detectors that everyone has called for          And according to the 9 11 Commission report  and I quote   While commercial aviation remains a possible target  terrorists may turn their attention to other modes    Opportunities to do harm are as great or greater in maritime or surface transportation   unquote          Port security is national security  and national security is port security   Instead  we have a decision making process that did not alert the president  the secretary of the treasury  the secretary of defense that several of our most critical ports were about to be  transferred to a foreign government entity          We ve heard from numerous administration spokespeople that those of us who are raising concerns are somehow out of place because  after all  it was a British company that was engaged in these activities selling to the Dubai company          For many of us  there is a significant difference between a private company and a foreign government entity           Under the Exxon Florio statute  which governs these foreign investments and the process that you undertook  if we are at all impacting national security  the full 45 day investigation of an investment by a foreign government is mandatory if it  quote   affects  national security           Yet the CFIUS board voted unanimously    according to our information    not to conduct an investigation that  by my reading of the statute  is required          Since D P  World is controlled by a foreign government  under the statute  the transaction requires a 45 day investigation if it affects national security          Secretary Chertoff has claimed  and I quote    We have a very disciplined process    it s a classified process    for reviewing any acquisition by a foreign company of assets that we consider relevant to national security   That process worked here           Well  on the face of it  it did not work  because the mandatory 45 day investigation was not conducted          So  Mr  Chairman  there are numerous problems with this review process that I think we need answers to   But in the larger context of port security  particularly given the problems we ve been having with the Department of Homeland Security    apparently the White House is about to issue their report about Katrina which just  based on the press reports  has to make you cry because what is it saying   Guess what   We need interoperable communications   Guess what  We need command and control          Well  guess what   It s four and a half years after 9 11  and many of us have been saying all of that for that long          So it s very troubling that we find ourselves in this position  and I  for one  hope that there are answers   But at the very least  I hope the 45 day investigation is carried out as required under the statute
