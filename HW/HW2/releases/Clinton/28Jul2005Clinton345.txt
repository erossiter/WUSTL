            Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill  entitled the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  and Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU   was approved by the Conference Committee on which Senator Clinton served  which includes an additional  28 million for Southern Tier projects  including federal funding for I 86  Route 12 Corridor  Route 15 99 in Presho  the City of Corning and East Avenue in Hornell  out of a total of over  230 million in special projects for New York   Senators Schumer and Clinton announced a substantial increase of approximately  3 billion in additional funding coming to New York State for highways and transit for a total of over  16 5 billion in total federal spending for New York   Specifically  the legislation includes  10 07 billion in highway funds and  6 5 billion for New York State  s transit systems  a 19 percent increase in annual average highway spending and a 30 percent increase in public transit funding compared to the previous six year transportation authorization bill   The bill also contains funding for research  safety  environment  transportation planning and security that will benefit all New Yorkers           Senator Clinton served as a member of the Conference between the House and Senate due to her role as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  Senator Schumer is a member of the Banking and Finance Committees  which control the transit funding and tax portions of the bill   Both Senators fought hard to ensure that provisions important to New York were retained in the Conference Report              This is great news for Binghamton and the entire Southern Tier   These transportation funds keep New Yorkers moving quickly and safely  while creating jobs across the state  These federal dollars will be a huge shot in the arm for local transit needs    new buses  repairs for buses  and fixing up our stations    and highway repairs and upgrades   Without first rate highway and transit facilities  New York would literally stop short     Schumer said    This funding will go to making our roads safer and more accessible   Upgrading I 86 and the improvements to the Route 12 will provide a vital service to the community as well as generate economic growth   This federal funding will present enormous opportunities for Binghamton and the Southern Tier             After two years of hard work  we have achieved a bill that will create jobs and bring significant resources to the entire Southern Tier   These funds will go a long way towards helping communities make the infrastructure improvements needed to keep their economies moving   said Senator Clinton  who served as a Senate conferee in negotiations on the bill   I am proud that our efforts have resulted in New York s share of funds growing to meet the ever increasing transportation demands on our state   We have made a substantial contribution to the future of the Southern Tier by investing in these critical road and transit projects and I look forward to seeing the positive impact the federal funding will have on the local economy and businesses in the community  I am especially pleased that we were able to secure funding for upgrades to I 86 and improvements on Route 12  which are vital passageways in the region   I am also pleased that we secured approval to rename a portion of Route 86 after former Congressman Amo Houghton and I am thrilled that we were able to secure language that will officially designate Interstate Highway 86 in the Southern Tier  as the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway   It is a most fitting tribute to his work  that this highway bear his name              The funding approved in the bill today includes            9 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for I 86 Route 17 Upgrades for Broome  Delaware  Chemung  Orange  Sullivan  and Cattaraugus Counties and  1 million for I 86 Route 17 Upgrades for Tioga County  The upgrade and designation of NYS Route 17 as Interstate 86 will make the Southern Tier  the Catskills  and the Lower Hudson Valley more competitive and able to attract substantial growth in business  industry  and tourism           9 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured in additional funding for the Route 12 Corridor Improvement Project  bringing the total in the bill to approximately  9 8 million  Route 12  which runs from the juncture of Route 17 and Interstate 81 in Broome County to Interstate 90 in Oneida County  is a two lane highway with limited passing opportunities and thus a history of significant traffic problems  Specifically  this funding would be used to continue construction on projects such as spot safety improvements and additional passing zones           3 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for conversion of NY Route 15 to I 99 Road Improvements  These funds will be used to construct a four lane expressway meeting Interstate standards from PA to Presho  New York  approximately 6 miles for future I 99 designation           4 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for Corning Transportation Improvements in addition to funds provided by the House for a total of approximately  10 million  Funds will go towards the Transit Center  which will bring together multiple transportation modes in downtown Corning just off of Exit 46 of I 86   Tour buses  intercity and intracity buses  taxis  and other transportation needs will be coordinated  The project will eliminate four different locations currently used for these transportation systems and bring them through one center which will ease congestion in other locations throughout downtown Corning   This coordination will enhance public safety concerns as well           2 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for Reconstruction of East Avenue from Main Street to Henry Street in Hornell  Funds will be used to improve deteriorating roadways  reconstruct curbing  improve drainage  and replace lighting and streetscape needs          Senators Schumer and Clinton today also announced the approval of several of their own provisions  including        Daniel Patrick Moynihan Interstate Highway    Senators Clinton and Schumer secured language in this bill renaming all of I 86 after the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  a fitting tribute to a man who once chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee and who fought hard in previous transportation reauthorization bills for the needs of New York   Senator Clinton introduced an Amendment last year that was accepted by the Senate during consideration of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill   The provision was retained in this year  s bill and will now become law        Amo Houghton Bypass    Senators Clinton and Schumer secured approval to rename a portion of Route 86 near Corning  NY  after former Congressman Amo Houghton who was primarily responsible for securing the funding that made construction of this bypass possible  Senator Clinton offered an Amendment  and it was accepted  during the Environment and Public Works Committee  s markup of the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Bill  This provision was also included in the House bill sponsored by Rep  Randy Kuhl         9 25 million that Senators Schumer and Clinton secured for the University of Buffalo  s Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER   Clinton and Schumer secured approval for  1 25 million per year  over the next five years  in funding for research on the impact of seismic activity on the federal highway system and the nation  s transportation network as well as ways to reduce our vulnerability from earthquakes  In addition  the Senators provided an additional  3 million to support ongoing research activities   The funding will also help improve earthquake simulation facilities  This is an important economic generator in Western New York and will keep the University of Buffalo at the forefront of this important research  Senator Clinton promised to fight hard to include the Multidisciplinary Center for Earthquake Engineering Research  MCEER  in this version of the bill  MCEER is a national center of excellence in advanced technology applications dedicated to the reduction of earthquake losses nationwide  MCEER is headquartered at the State University of New York at Buffalo  The Center was originally established by the National Science Foundation  NSF  in 1986 and has been included in every reauthorization bill since its creation         High Priority Corridor Amendment   Clinton and Schumer worked to secure approval for Route 219 in Western New York  I 86 I 99  I 87 from the Quebec border to New York City  the East West Corridor from Watertown to Vermont  and I 95 from New York to Connecticut to be designated as high priority corridors  making them eligible for specific high priority corridor funding          National System Study Commission   The Conference Report contains a provision creating the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission that Senator Clinton authored as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee   This Commission will determine the future transportation needs of New York and the nation   This Commission will combine the National Transportation System Study and the Commission on Future Revenue Sources to Support the Highway Trust Fund into one single commission   Senator Clinton worked with former NYSDOT Commissioner and current Federal Railroad Administrator Joe Boardman to push this idea forward   The objective of combining these two bodies into a comprehensive evaluation of the future of transportation and its financing provides a roadmap for better allocation of transportation funding resources in the future   A better allocation will mean funding based on needs  which can only help New York   It will hopefully result in rewards for New York because of high transit use  which contributes to a more sustainable transportation network        CargoWatch Technology    the Senators secured  3 5 million for PAR Technology  s CargoWatch Transportation Management Program   This funding is in addition to funds added in the House  These funds will be used to identify  track  and manage cargo within containers along with associated over the road assets from point origin until destination  Tracking container shipping supply chains will provide essential national security and efficient transportation management   The tracking system is being developed by PAR Technologies  based in New Hartford  NY        The Conference Report is now scheduled to be considered by both the Senate and the House sometime later this week  After passing each house  the approved Report will then go to the President  s desk to be signed   The bill originally passed the House on March 10 and the Senate on May 17   The new project funding is in addition to any money already approved by the House
