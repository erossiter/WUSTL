                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Offers Amendments to Fix Problems Plaguing Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    In a hearing of the Senate Aging Committee  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today pressed Dr  Mark McClellan  Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  CMS   for answers on why the Bush Administration failed to heed warnings that the Medicare prescription drug benefit was headed for trouble and how the Administration is addressing the problems that continue to plague it   Senator Clinton secured a commitment from Administrator McClellan that he would ensure pharmacists get reimbursed for stepping in to make sure their customers get the medicines they need   McClellan also agreed to review legislation Senator Clinton introduced to help those dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid transition into the new Medicare prescription drug benefit by requiring outreach and education to pharmacies on these beneficiaries and waiving the transaction fees that pharmacies incur when assisting them   Senator Clinton today also announced that she is co sponsoring two amendments to the tax reconciliation bill in the Senate as part of her continued push to fix the broken prescription drug program            Senator Clinton noted that she has visited pharmacies in Buffalo  Rochester  Syracuse  Albany  and New York City and heard horror stories from pharmacists  doctors  nurses  seniors  people with disabilities and family members across New York who are struggling to navigate this complex and confusing program    It is an absolute embarrassment  outrage  deep heartbreaking disappointment to be in the presence of people who are so distraught  confused  upset  and feeling abandoned   said Senator Clinton            Senator Clinton urged bipartisan support for her legislation to fix the flawed program    I for one believe we should scrap this and start over   We are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on an inefficient delivery of a plan that could be done in a much more cost effective way  We have taken tax payer dollars by the billions and transferred it to the pharmaceutical companies and the insurance companies as a way to entice  even bribe them  to provide drug coverage to the poorest of the poor and the sickest of the sick   That is not in keeping with either our values  or frankly  what should be expected of high performance government   Senator Clinton emphasized             Senator Clinton is co sponsoring an amendment to the tax reconciliation bill with Senator Jay Rockefeller  W Va   that includes key elements of the comprehensive bill Senator Clinton and Senate Democrats introduced last month   The amendment includes Senator Clinton s legislation to help dual eligibles   The amendment also would require all prescription drug plans to provide new enrollees with at least 30 days of prescription drugs during their transition to Medicare  allow pharmacies to bill CMS directly for the costs of providing a transitional supply of prescription drugs to dual eligibles  require CMS to provide compensation to dual eligibles incorrectly charged premiums  deductibles or other cost sharing above statutory limits  and require CMS to provide full reimbursement to states who incurred unexpected costs filling the gaps of this federal benefit              Senator Clinton is co sponsoring a second amendment with Senator Bill Nelson  FL  based on legislation they introduced that would extend the amount of time beneficiaries have to enroll in the prescription drug program  expanding the existing six month enrollment period to the entire year of 2006   The amendment also gives every beneficiary the opportunity to make a one time change in plan enrollment at any point in 2006 so that beneficiaries are not penalized if they need to change plans to better meet their needs            Senator Clinton has been a vocal advocate for the need to fix the problems plaguing the new Medicare prescription drug program and ensure that Medicare recipients receive the assistance they need and deserve   Senator Clinton has released a resource guide to prescription drug coverage under Medicare  available in English and Spanish  to help New Yorkers navigate this transition  The guide has been distributed to more than 75 000 New Yorkers and is posted on Senator Clinton  s website at www clinton senate gov           The transcript of Senator Clinton  s opening statement at today  s Senate
