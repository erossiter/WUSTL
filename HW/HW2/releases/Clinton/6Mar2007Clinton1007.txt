March 6  2007 Senator Clinton Questions Army Generals About Living Conditions and Administration of Outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator Clinton  Obviously we re here today because we are all distressed by the problems that are facing our wounded soldiers   I think we all agree that these men and women are the best we have and they deserve a lot better from our government and our country   I have tried to focus in on the needs and treatment of our wounded and sick soldiers   And over the last two years  I was disturbed by reports about pay problems that wounded soldiers were confronting and had an amendment accepted in the last year s DoD Authorization Bill  And my office was recently briefed on the result of a study that I commissioned in that amendment   an audit that found that 24 percent of wounded soldiers requiring in patient care had underpayments  that is they weren t paid on time   And the Army  I know is working to fix the problem  but the number is still too high            Now we have learned that wounded soldiers are living in substandard conditions trapped in bureaucratic red tape   And this is just the latest incident   If all we were here to talk about would be the problems in Building 18 and the other problems that have emerged  not only at Walter Reed but other of our facilities  that would be disturbing enough   But there is a pattern here that somehow we re just not focused on what needs to be done to help these young men and women   And I m deeply concerned that the problems they are confronting could be  frankly  overlooked again if we just focus on who made what decision to put in new carpeting in Building 18 and what else needs to be done  This is a systemic problem            When I was out at Walter Reed on Friday  I had an opportunity to visit with a number of our wounded and sick soldiers from New York as well as seeing Building 18 for myself   One of the common denominators of the complaints I heard remains the disjointed and unfair Medical Evaluation Board and Physical Evaluation Board process  the untrained and over worked Physical Evaluation Board liaison officers  the various stops along the process  the lack of legal counsel during the appeals  the prolonged period either to start or complete the process  We ve already heard about the disconnect between the Department of Veterans Affairs schedule for rating disabilities that doesn t adequately address the current nature of wounds like TBI and PTSD and amputations and hearing lose and diseases   In the audience is Steve Robertson  He and I worked together a couple of years ago in trying to get a pre  and post deployment physical exam done so we can actually tell what was the condition of a soldier before being deployed and the condition of that soldier when he returned   And one of the things we could not get through was a mental exam assessment before someone was deployed   We re now hearing that people who are reporting with TBI and PTSD are being told it was a pre existing condition   If the proposal that I had made and that others had lobbied for had been accepted  we might have a baseline to figure out what actually happened to these young men and women during their deployments   And the problem that I heard over and over again  is a perception that Walter Reed was concerned with releasing soldiers from active duty at a greatly reduced disability benefit level as quickly as possible  a lump sum solution cheaper than a life time of financial retirement care            And I have a number of soldiers whose specific cases I would like to present to you and to get your response to  A specialist from Grand Island  NY  appealing his Physical Evaluation Board disability benefit rating of 20 percent has chronic pain conditions and without medical retirement will not qualify for life time insurance   The pain condition is debilitating   He doesn t believe that s being taken into consideration   And here s the dilemma he faces today   He s been offered a new treatment  but if he accepts the new medical treatment  he loses his opportunity to appeal   If he proceeds with his appeal  he loses his opportunity for the new medical treatment   I mean  there is just something wrong with that kind of Hobson s choice to present to this young specialist            A major from Manhattan  he was injured in OEF in 2001  but stayed on active duty deferred treatment until finally he couldn t and now he s been at Walter Reed for 26 months   And he didn t feel like he was being taken care of at Walter Reed  so he sought treatment at Bethesda where he was able to appeal the Walter Reed prognosis and receive the surgery his injury required   He began the Medical Evaluation Board process in December 06  but has not been able to meet with his liaison officer because she canceled his first four appointments and now is too busy to meet with him   He s trying to get legal assistance  His requests have gone unanswered            And finally  a staff sergeant from the Bronx  also appealing a Physical Evaluation Board disability percentage because he believes that the case misevaluated his pain and didn t give him a high enough return   And when he met with me he denied himself his medication so that he could meet with me and feel like he was in full control of his faculties and it was totally evident to me that he was suffering from pain on an ongoing basis            So  it s really important that we take on this Medical Evaluation Board and Physical Evaluation Board process   But again  I think we ve got to do more to try to clean up the system now   I know we have to approach the longer term problems  but it does strike me as totally unacceptable that according to press reports there are three lawyers and one paralegal to handle a seven hundred and fifty case caseload to deal with these PEB appeals  General Schoonmaker  we have over four thousand JAG lawyers in the active reserve and National Guard of the Army   Can we please get some help to try to clean up this backlog and get people some legal assistance as they re trying to go through this process        General Schoomaker  We are going to gang tackle that out there  I am not familiar with the numbers you just said  but what did you have       Lt  General Kiley  No  I agree with the Senator that we ve gotta get this stuff fixed and I agree with the Chief and we re going to take that out  And this is my references earlier  There are things or actions we can take  more JAG officers  more case workers  But I do think the first case  the young soldier with the 20 percent disability  as you know Senator  doesn t rise to the 30 percent which is the medical retirement  And frankly  it s not the fault of the doctors or the case managers and it is not the fault of the people in the PEB who are just being stingy with the dollars  It is more based on where our regulations and our policies have in place  To me  even if it is a temporary medical retirement until the soldier heals up more  I think we should be much more aggressive in recognizing that  The VA s very quick to recognize the whole man or woman and reimburse at a much higher rate  But as we ve said earlier  that doesn t get you the medical retirement  it doesn t get you the care for your children and your spouse  And there s clearly a financial impact over the long haul to the department and to both departments in terms of that  but I think it s the right thing to do  The individual obstacles about getting appointments  etcetera  We re taking that on right now as the chief has said       Senator Clinton  Well obviously we need  as General Schoomaker often does very memorably say  to gang tackle this problem and let s try to get it on a faster track  Obviously we have systemic problems and I just want to end with two additional points because I am going to have to recess and go vote  Senator Dole  can you go next        Senator Dole  Yes      Senator Clinton  Okay  let me just conclude by saying  number one  I am deeply concerned about the impact that the BRAC Commission order had on Walter Reed   It was  I believe  demoralizing  I don t know that we can put an exact frame around what didn t happen because people were either of the opinion that they were going out of business in a few years anyway  or they were pulled off of caring for patients and dealing with the important issues right in front of them because they were involved in planning for the eventual end of Walter Reed  And I really hope  and I ve told Secretary Gates this  you ve gotta take a look at this  I don t have an answer for it  but I think it has undermined an already fragile system           And finally  these independent contractors  It is a problem  Our government is outsourcing important services to people who we are not accountable for  And this idea that yet again  Halliburton  and it raises its head by being a former Halliburton official who got a contract to do in house maintenance at Walter Reed  I tell you folks  this has got to end  Somebody has got to be responsible and all this contracting out of the important work that we re doing and then we try to turn around and find out who in the chain of command is responsible  Well let s start by making it clear that we re just not going to turn over important jobs to people that we are not directly responsible for           So with that  I am going to have to run and vote  but I am going to leave it in good hands with my friend and colleague  Senator Dole  And I want to commend your husband Senator Dole  Former Senator Dole and Secretary Shalala are going to be heading up this commission and I think the President s made a good choice with the two to do that                Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning Walter Reed
