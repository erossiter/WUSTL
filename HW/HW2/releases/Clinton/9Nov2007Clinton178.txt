                Funds Included in Department of Defense Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Senate has approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill conference report which includes  16 75 million in defense funding for the Greater Rochester Region    The bill  having been approved by both chambers of Congress  will now be sent to the President for his signature    This is terrific news for the greater Rochester region and a vital step in the appropriations process  said Senator Schumer  These critical funds will help us ensure that in defending our nation  we are equipped with the most cutting edge technology and know how  All of the institutions awarded here are doing research and work that will boost both our national defense and the Rochester regions economy  I will urge the president to sign this bill immediately    This is welcome news for these local companies  and for the Greater Rochester region  As they continue to build their capacity in support of our men and women in uniform  so too they build the reputation of the region and their own role in support of the local economy  The funds approved by the Senate are an important investment in the Greater Rochester region for many reasons  not only are we supporting our troops serving overseas and at home  but we are also investing in local technology  local jobs  and the regions reputation for cutting edge research and development  Senator Clinton said    The  16 75 million for Rochester in the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations bill includes   Delphi  Accelerating Fuel Cells Manufacturability    2 75 Million   Funding will help to accelerate the application of fuel cells for a wide range of DoD electrical power needs  including  but not limited to  ships and submarines  soldier power  ground vehicles  mobile electric power for bases and other field equipment  and aircraft   In particular  this project will enable the DoD to advance fuel cell manufacturing feasibility and readiness for field testing   Infotonics Research Center  Infotonics Research    2 4 Million   The National Center for Infotonics is a collaboration between New York State research universities and the photonics industry to accelerate research and technology commercialization and transfer and industry development in photonics and micro systems   Dozens of companies involved in photonics and micro systems are working with a number of research universities in New York State to develop a comprehensive approach to solving problems facing the photonics and micro systems industries and make them more competitive internationally   Photonics and micro systems will be the key components in many future technologies and weapons systems   Funding will support research into photonics and micro systems applications for defense applications  including Measurement and Control Systems  Information and Communications Systems and Power Technologies   Technologies developed at the National Center for Infotonics will also have chem bio detection and health monitoring applications     General Motors  Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion    1 6 Million   For FY 08  the initiative proposes to demonstrate a commercially based front wheel drive SUV style hydrogen fuel cell vehicle with significantly improved capabilities and performance as compared with earlier vehicles  The lessons learned in this ongoing initiative will bring hydrogen fuel cell vehicles an important step closer to deployment in U S  Army non tactical fleets   General Motors  Future Fuel Non Tactical Vehicle Initiative    1 6 Million   In FY05 and FY06  successful 6 month long demonstrations of a hydrogen fuel cell pick up truck and SUV were completed operating at the USMC installation at Camp Pendleton  CA   It is proposed that the U S  Navy and U S  Marine Corps  USMC  build upon the aforementioned short term demonstrations with an expanded demonstration of  3  Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell vehicles at the USMC installation at Camp Pendleton and an extended vehicle range refueling capability enhancement of the U S  Navy installed hydrogen refueling site at Camp Pendleton   RIT  Defense Modernization and Sustainment Initiative    2 Million   Funding will be used to improve the modernization  readiness and sustainment of defense systems by developing processes and tools to track the status and future health of defense systems  detect  diagnose and repair material aging failures  and provide decision support systems for use in determining when and how to upgrade these systems   The Department of Defense  while developing new systems that will enable advances in military capability  must simultaneously maintain and improve the capabilities of existing systems   The number and complexity of legacy systems  as well as the replacement costs  demand that attention and resources continue to be effectively allocated to current systems   This research program provides DoD with a comprehensive approach to address these issues based on life cycle engineering principles   Over the past several years  these programs have already yielded significant cost savings for the manufacture and upgrade of several platforms and systems  as well as significantly extending the life of existing systems   For example  one project  out of several that are ongoing as part of this research program  to improve the maintenance and extend the life of the militarys fleet of Light Armored Vehicles  LAVs  is projected to reduce maintenance costs by  2 1 million per year  and  42 million over the life cycle of the platform    Integrated Nano Technologies  Hand held Nanotechnology Enabled Bio warfare Agent Identification System    2 4 Million   This project will enable rapid prototyping of a lightweight  palm sized device for rapid identification of biological warfare agents by military operators and first responders during Counter Proliferation  Combating WMD and Consequence Management Operations on the battlefield and in the homeland   The device  weighing approximately one pound  will employ a laboratory on a chip capability to provide accurate results in the field with laboratory sensitivity   Impact Technologies  Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring System for UAVs    4 Million   This project will develop and implement an Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring  IVHM  system to be applied to the Armys unmanned air or land vehicles   The technologies will be focused on critical system fault detection and prediction capability for enabling the Condition Based Maintenance Plus  CBM   DoD Initiative  utilizing advanced fault signature analysis and component isolation reasoning software   Funding will help to deliver a product that is capable of detecting and predicting common control sensor actuator failures  engine faults  and related vehicle degradation scenarios
