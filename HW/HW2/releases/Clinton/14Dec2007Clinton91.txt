December 14  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Resignation of John Tanner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     John Tanner s resignation today as Chief of the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice was long overdue   And while I welcome the news of Mr  Tanner s departure  it is quite clear that the systemic problems that plague the Voting Rights Section go well beyond one person   By what it has done and what it has failed to do  the Bush Justice Department has made clear it would rather advance its narrow partisan agenda than the cause of civil rights   It has repeatedly put ideology ahead of justice  and we are seeing  and suffering  the consequences      The Voting Rights Section s missteps and failures under Mr  Tanner s stewardship have been well documented   Ideology and partisanship have overtaken the Voting Rights Section and been allowed to infect every facet of the office  from its hiring practices to its decisions about which cases to prosecute   In selecting a new Section Chief  the President must choose someone who will disavow partisanship and refocus the Voting Rights Section on its historic mission of protecting the voting rights of all Americans
