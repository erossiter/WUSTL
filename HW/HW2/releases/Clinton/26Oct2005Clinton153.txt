October 26  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  Condemning Remarks By Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The outrageous remarks today by Iranian President Ahmadinejad on Israel simply have no place in the community of nations  It is tragic that inflammatory words like these are even uttered  let alone used at a rally of Iranian youth    The United States should join with the international community in expressing outrage and condemn these remarks in the strongest possible terms
