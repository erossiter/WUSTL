                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she is introducing the Senate version of legislation to establish a federal grant program to promote development and neighborhood revitalization  The Neighborhood Reclamation and Revitalization Act of 2007  which was introduced in the House of Representatives last week by Congressman Brian Higgins  is aimed at supporting the demolition of vacant  dilapidated houses to make way for new development and neighborhood revitalization    The Neighborhood Reclamation and Revitalization Act of 2007 is supported by the City of Buffalo  which recently unveiled a  100 million five year plan to demolish 5 000 houses  about half of all the vacant houses in the city  and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation  among others    We all want to see our cities and urban areas thrive  Neighborhood revitalization is a critical component of any local economic development but if we are to help our cities redevelop and grow both socially and economically  one of the key ways we can do that is by providing the support necessary to remove the blight of vacant and dilapidated housing  said Senator Clinton   I am proud to join Congressman Higgins in introducing this legislation that will help local communities across New York and the country take positive steps towards urban revitalization and renewal  This bill will not only create a grant program for communities to help them get rid of vacant housing  it will also provide them with innovative ways to re use and revitalize    The crime and decay associated with vacant properties are not just a problem for Buffalo  but are a fiscal drain for local governments all across Upstate New York and the country  said Congressman Brian Higgins  NY 27    With this legislation Senator Clinton once again demonstrates her commitment to resolving the difficult issues that break down communities  risk the lives of first responders and threaten long term economic growth    I am very appreciative of Senator Clinton s support of this critically important federal legislation  which Congressman Higgins introduced in the House of Representatives  said Mayor Byron W  Brown  Both Senator Clinton and Congressman Higgins have demonstrated great leadership in helping the City Of Buffalo address the continuing challenge of vacant  dilapidated structures  which my Administration is working aggressively to reduce in neighborhoods where these structures harm property values  negatively affect our residents  quality of life and pose safety concerns   By removing these problem properties  we are able to move forward with redevelopment efforts that will strengthen both our residential neighborhoods and commercial districts    Were delighted that our local delegation is working together to provide the strong leadership at the Federal level that our National Vacant Properties Campaigns report  Blueprint Buffalo  outlined as a necessary step to overcoming the problems of vacancy and abandonment in our community   Senator Clinton and Representative Higgins bill speaks not only to the need to remove vacant buildings  but also to provide resources for the economically productive reuse of the land thereafter   The Senator and Congressman know that in older industrial cities like Buffalo  where the problems of vacant properties have become all too apparent  a cooperative and committed Federal  State and local effort is needed to move our cities forward to a brighter future  said Michael K  Clarke  Program Director  Buffalo LISC   Under the Neighborhood Reclamation and Revitalization Program Act of 2007  municipalities that have a history of continued population loss since 1980  a vacant housing problem  and a comprehensive plan to demolish that housing  would be eligible to apply to the Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  for both funding for demolition and a study for how newly vacant land should be redeveloped   Grantees would be required to report back to HUD on the projects progress one year after the grant has been awarded      The bill would also give municipalities the opportunity to study and assess how land  once vacated  could be redeveloped into a more productive use   The intent of these studies is to ensure  to the extent feasible  that the timeline from demolition to revitalization is as brief as possible  given the difficult market environment in these communities    In this study process  municipalities could engage local groups in their re use plans  look at creative ways to reconfigure and update infrastructure  explore the concept of urban farming and community gardens  and use other innovative means to bring new vibrancy to neighborhoods     The bill authorizes appropriations of  100 million over three years to help cities demolish vacant homes that are beyond repair  improve overall quality of the housing stock in these cities  and alleviate some of the fiscal strain that abandon houses wreak on local government   Funds granted as a part of this program would be considered supplemental to funds communities already receive through other HUD grant programs    Congressman Higgins began work on this bill following several vacant house fires in the City of Buffalo  the most serious of which caused significant injuries to Buffalo firefighter Mark Reed  which have strained the limited resources of local first responders   By demolishing vacant homes that are beyond repair  the overall quality of the housing stock in Buffalo neighborhoods would improve  alleviating some of the strain that poverty wreaks on local government
