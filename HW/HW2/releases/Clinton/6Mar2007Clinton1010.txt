March 6  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on GSA to Commit to Fully Funding Buffalo Courthouse Project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Reiterates Concerns About Delays                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the General Services Administration to commit to fully funding the construction of the Buffalo courthouse with the  280 million that is set to be approved by Congress for Fiscal Year 2007            In a letter to GSA Administrator Lurita Alexis Doan  Senator Clinton reiterated her serious concerns about delays in the construction of the Buffalo Courthouse project  especially following news reports last week that the GSA has not yet decided how much funding to allocate to the project from the Fiscal Year 2007 Budget           The Senator also discussed her concerns with Mayor Byron W  Brown during a meeting in her office in Washington  DC today           For far too long  we have been fighting for these funds  The authorization process of the Buffalo Courthouse is complete  and Congress has provided adequate funding in this year s budget   said Senator Clinton    I again urge the GSA to fully fund the courthouse project this year            I appreciate Senator Clinton s strong support for the full funding of the future federal courthouse in Downtown Buffalo   said Mayor Brown    This is a significant development project for our city and any further delays in federal funding are potentially harmful to my Administration s overall economic development agenda for Buffalo   Thanks to the efforts of Senator Clinton and our entire federal legislative delegation  I am confident we will see this project move forward           Last month  Senator Clinton wrote to GSA Administrator Doan  calling on her to commit to fully fund the construction of the courthouse with the  280 million that is set to be approved by Congress for Fiscal Year 2007  Read More    Today the Senator reiterated her call on the GSA to commit to the project with the funds that are already available          While the Office of Management and Budget said last month that the President s Fiscal Year 2008 budget will include  47 million for the construction of the courthouse  it remains unclear if the GSA will allocate sufficient funds for the Buffalo project in Fiscal Year 2007  It is estimated that to fully fund construction of the new courthouse   130 million in federal funds will be required   280 million for federal courthouse construction has already been included in the Congressional Fiscal Year 2007 continuing spending resolution  which passed the U S  House of Representatives and will soon be taken up by the U S  Senate  These funds are allocated to projects by the General Services Administration and should be sufficient to cover the Buffalo Courthouse construction           At Senator Clinton s urging  the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed Senate Authorization of  123 million for Courthouse construction in September 2003         A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below      March 6  2007      The Honorable Lurita Alexis Doan  Administrator  United States General Services Administration  1800 F Street  N W   Washington  D C  20405      Dear Ms  Doan       In February of this year  I wrote to you  calling on the General Services Administration  GSA  to fully fund the construction of the new federal courthouse proposed for downtown Buffalo with the  280 million that is set to be approved by Congress for Fiscal Year 2007          While we know that  47 million will be included in the President s Fiscal Year 2008 Budget for the Buffalo Courthouse construction  I would ask that you commit to fully funding the construction of the courthouse with the  280 million that is set to be approved by Congress for Fiscal Year 2007          I write today to reiterate my concerns  especially in light of news reports from last week that quote Martha Dorris  Acting Associate Administrator at the General Services Administration  as saying that   There is no final list of courthouses  that are scheduled to receive funding   Mrs  Dorris went on to state that   Any speculation  on the budget  would be purely that    I would once again urge the utmost expedience in authorizing the construction of the courthouse           The Federal court is currently located in a building constructed in 1936 as part of a Public Works project and is sorely lacking in space and modern security measures   The new facility would alleviate the space shortages at the current facility by including new office space for judges and magistrates  the United States attorney and the United States Marshal s Service   In addition  the new building would provide grand jury space and prisoner holding cells   Centrally located in the downtown area  the courthouse will anchor the ongoing downtown revitalization effort          As you know  the FY 07 spending resolution  which passed the House and will soon pass the Senate  includes  280 million for federal courthouse construction   The resolution provides discretion to the General Services Administration  GSA  to decide how to allocate this money  which is far more than the  130 million needed to complete the Buffalo project   However  recent press reports indicate that GSA has not yet decided whether to fully fund the Buffalo project this year  and the inclusion of  47 million in the FY 08 budget casts further doubt on GSA s plans   Buffalo has waited too long for this important project  and I urge you to provide full funding this year so that it can be completed as soon as possible  I sincerely hope that the bureaucracy can  in this instance  be tamed in order to allow this much needed project to move forward          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
