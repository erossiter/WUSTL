November 3  2006 Senator Clinton and Colleagues Protest Closure of New York City  s Only Walk In Medicare Help Center                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Empire Medicare Service Center  Located on 800 Second Avenue in Manhattan  Closed Due to Budget Cuts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has joined with her Congressional Colleagues  including Representatives Carolyn B  Maloney  Jerrold Nadler  Anthony D  Weiner  Jos     E  Serrano  Joseph Crowley and Michael R  McNulty to express her opposition to the closure of the only walk in Medicare help center in New York City  The federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services eliminated funding for the walk in center at 800 Second Avenue  forcing it to close   Since the closure  seniors have instead been encouraged to use the Internet or a 1 800 number to resolve their Medicare related problems          In a joint letter to the Ms  Leslie Norwalk  Acting Commissioner of Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS   the Members of Congress expressed their dismay at the closure of the center  which provided a vital service for senior citizens and disabled individuals who are experiencing problems with Medicare or are facing confusing choices about the Medicare prescription drug program  and called for it to be reopened            Confusion around the Medicare prescription drug benefit is one of the top concerns I hear as I talk with New York s seniors     said Senator Clinton     This Medicare walk in center was a critical access point to the roughly 40 percent of New York s seniors that live in New York City and are trying to get these and other questions about their Medicare services answered   With all the problems that have plagued the 1 800 Medicare number and Medicare s prescription drug website  this is no time to add to the confusion by closing a reliable and trusted option that has worked              A copy of the letter from Senator Clinton is below          October 30  2006      Ms  Leslie Norwalk  Acting Commissioner  Medicare and Medicaid Services  United States Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W    Washington  D C  20201      Dear Ms  Norwalk        We are writing to express our strong opposition to the closing of the Walk In Center at the Empire Medicare Service Center  located on 800 Second Avenue in Manhattan   Empire Medicare is a contractor of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS  and we understand that CMS informed them that the budget for beneficiary walk in services needed to be cut  necessitating the closing of the Walk In Center   It is extremely troubling that CMS would eliminate this essential customer service center for those who need it the most            Our offices have been inundated with phone calls from doctors  beneficiaries  and families who will be seriously impacted by the closing of this outreach center   As you know  the Center provides a vital service for senior citizens and disabled individuals who are facing confusing choices about the Medicare prescription drug program  have experienced problems with Medicare  or have language barriers that make it difficult for them to resolve problems   These beneficiaries will now be forced to use the 1 800 Medicare hotline  which is no substitute for caring professionals  many of whom have decades of experience with the program in this community          We believe that closing this facility will seriously undermine the quality of service provided to Medicare beneficiaries   According to the New York Department for the Aging  roughly 40  of New York State s seniors live in New York City and because this walk in center is the only one of its kind in the New York Metropolitan area  it serves 5 000  7 000 New Yorkers every year from all five boroughs   With such a large portion of the elderly population residing in the New York Metropolitan area  it is vital to have a center that they can visit to obtain assistance in resolving their Medicare concerns                                               Instead of providing a full service facility  Empire Medicare will reportedly be encouraging the elderly to use self service technology such as a 1 800 number and the internet   However  we are concerned that New York s Medicare beneficiaries  their families  and health care providers will be unable to get their needs met with these distance technologies which many do not have access to  and that are already overwhelmed by those attempting to sort through the Medicare prescription drug benefit   Further  these problems can be exacerbated by illness or disability   In fact  the State Department for the Aging reports that nearly 30  of the City s elderly have a sensory disability  while 30  have a mental disability           As you know  New York City has one of the most diverse senior populations in the country   We understand that roughly 20  of the individuals serviced by the Center do not speak English and thus  require bilingual caseworkers   We are concerned that without the services provided by the Center  these individuals will not receive the benefits to which they are entitled          hile seniors will still be able to access New York State Health Insurance Information  Counseling and Assistance Program  HICAP  volunteers with their questions  these individuals do not have the technical expertise of the Empire Medicare Service Center employees and need to be supplemented by trained Medicare customer service representatives          The decision to close the Walk In Center on Second Avenue is short sighted and harmful to our constituents   We urge you to reconsider the decision and look forward to working with you to resolve this problem without interruption in these critical services for New York s Medicare beneficiaries          Sincerely       Hillary Rodham Clinton                                    United States Senate    Carolyn B  Maloney  United States House of Representatives    Jerrold Nadler   United States House of Representatives    Anthony D  Weiner  United States House of Representatives    Jos     E  Serrano              United States House of Representatives       Joseph Crowley  United States House of Representatives    Michael R  McNulty  United States House of Representatives
