September 30  2005 Statement Of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton On Cuts To The Community Service Block Grant                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           It is outrageous that the Republican leadership in the House and Senate has pushed through a Continuing Resolution that drastically cuts much needed programs in the Community Service Block Grant   CSBG provides critical services to low income people throughout New York  and under this bill  New York stands to lose half of its funding        More than 200 diverse CSBG programs provide services to 113 000 thousand people in New York City alone  CSBG is truly one of the most targeted and unique programs of its kind  providing the services that are most needed in every community to combat poverty  empower disadvantaged people  reduce teen pregnancy  assist the elderly  help immigrants in their transition to America  and much more   Last year  as a direct result of CSBG services  more than 10 000 young people received tutoring  8 700 seniors were able to remain in their homes and live independently  2 700 adults benefited from literacy classes  and 12 500 immigrants improved their command of the English language   CSBG also serves as a catalyst  leveraging funding and support from across the state   Last year  New York City received  30 6 million from CSBG  which leveraged an additional  7 6 million in local public matching funds   24 million in private and other funds  and recruited volunteer services valued at  42 million   The CR will slash that funding in half      Prior to passage of the CR  Senate Republicans defeated an amendment that I co sponsored with Senator Harkin to restore funding to CSBG   This current CR expires on November 18th   I will continue to fight to make sure that this funding in included before Congress adjourns for the session
