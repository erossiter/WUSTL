                Nation s Highest Military Honor to be Awarded to Patchogue Native Who Sacrificed his Life During Combat Mission in Afghanistan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Tim Bishop today welcomed the news that Long Island native  Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy  who was killed in action on June 28  2005 while serving in Afghanistan  OPERATION Enduring Freedom  will be posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism in combat  Lieutenant Murphy  age 29  a U S  Navy SEAL  was killed in action while serving as part of a reconnaissance mission in Afghanistan  The award was approved by the President on September 7  and the Medal of Honor will be presented to Lt  Murphys parents at a White House ceremony on October 22     A native son of Long Island and a true hero in every sense of the word  Lt  Michael Murphys life is a testament to honor on and off the battlefield  said Senator Clinton  Without regard for his own safety  Michael exposed himself to enemy fire in an attempt to save the lives of his fellow team members who were greatly outnumbered by a determined and vicious enemy  This epitomizes the integrity and dedication that those who have known Lt  Murphy had come to expect from the young man who grew up in Patchogue  New York  Lt  Murphys acts of heroism can never be fully repaid  but it is my hope that the Medal of Honor will serve to honor his memory and ensure that the selfless sacrifice he made that day will not be forgotten    Lt  Michael Murphy s legacy has reached far beyond the shores of Long Island  said Congressman Bishop  His sacrifice reminds us of the dangers the men and women of our Armed Forces face in order to defend our nation  I can think of no one more deserving of this medal today  It can never make up for his loss  but it extends the honor which he and his family so well deserve    Lieutenant Murphy was killed during a reconnaissance mission  in support of OPERATION Red Wings  Kunar Province  Afghanistan in search of Taliban and al Qaeda insurgents  Lieutenant Murphys four man Navy SEAL team was dropped off in a heavily forested area along steep terrain in the country s eastern mountain border with Pakistan  During the mission  the groups position was compromised  and shortly afterwards came under attack from a large insurgent force      Reports have stated that Lt  Murphy  in an attempt to establish radio contact for assistance  abandoned his secure position and exposed himself to the enemies withering gunfire  Although immediately wounded while making the call  he returned to his position and continued fighting where he saved the life of one of his fellow SEALs  Of the four man SEAL group  Murphy and two others were killed  The lone survivor was the SEAL whose life was saved by Lt  Murphy     At Patchogue Medford High School on Long Island  Michael Murphy was a National Honor Society student and a varsity football athlete  He worked as a lifeguard during his summer vacations  He attended Penn State University  majoring in political science and excelling academically     Michael decided shortly after graduating from college that he would fulfill his passion to become a Navy SEAL  He served with distinction and was posthumously awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart in recognition of his courage and sacrifice    He is survived by his mother Maureen Murphy  his father Dan Murphy  his brother John Murphy  and his fiance Heather Duggan   In 2006  Clinton and Bishop sought to honor Lt  Murphy by having the U S  Post Office in Patchogue renamed as the Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy Post Office Building  The legislation was originally introduced in the House of Representatives by Bishop  where it was passed unanimously  It was then introduced by Clinton in the Senate  where it passed  and was later signed into law by the President on August 2  2006    Lieutenant Michael P  Murphy is the first recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions in combat in Afghanistan in support of OPERATION Enduring Freedom and the first Congressional Medal of Honor awarded to a Sailor since the Vietnam War   There have been two other Congressional Medal of Honor recipients since the attacks of September 11  2001  both for actions in support of OPERATION Iraqi Freedom      Congress made the Medal of Honor a permanent decoration in 1863 and it is the highest honor bestowed upon American soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines  It is awarded by the President  in the name of Congress  to a person who distinguishes himself or herself conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in action against an enemy of the United States  while engaged in military operations involving conflict with an opposing foreign force  or while serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a belligerent party  The deed performed must have been one of personal bravery or self sacrifice so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual above his or her comrades and must have involved risk of life  Incontestable proof of the performance of the service will be exacted and each recommendation for the award of this decoration will be considered on the standard of extraordinary merit
