                 chumer  Clinton  Defense Projects are Vitally Important for the New York State Economy and National Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the Joint House and Senate Conference Committee approved  19 1 million in the FY06 Defense Appropriations bill for projects to benefit Western New York   The House has approved the bill   The Senate is expected to work on the Defense Appropriations bill this week   If the bill is passed  it will be sent to the President for his signature          Projects to be funded under the bill include   8 million for Unmanned Threat Emitter  UMTE  Modernization by DRS    Electronic Warfare and Network Systems and  2 1 million for the Multi spectral Threat Emitter by DRS   2 5 million for the Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center  s LENS X Hypervelocity Ground Testing program   2 million for Carwell Products   Army and Marine Corps Corrosion Prevention program   2 million for Buffalo  s NanoDynamics Inc  for their Portable SOFC JP 8 Demonstrators   1 million to General Dynamics and CUBRC for research on Acute Care of Blast Effects   Head Injuries  and  1 5 million for Buffalo BioBlower  s air sterilization project                This is great news for Western New York   said Schumer   Additional funds will not only boost the area economy  but also put the Western New York and New York State at the forefront of defense technology  As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these Western New York defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge             Western New York has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge defense research and technology   Senator Clinton said   This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local companies and the communities they support             8 million in federal funds will go to DRS    Electronic Warfare and Network Systems for the UMTE Modernization project  Money for the UMTE program will be used to upgrade four existing systems located at one of the key ranges at the Nellis Test and Training Range in Nevada  The continuing proliferation of surface to air missiles and other anti aircraft presents a significant threat to our military forces  This upgrade of the UMTE systems takes advantage of mature and electronic warfare threat simulation technology and will result in more realistic training  and increased aircrew survivability  while providing substantial savings  DRS received  2 5 million of federal funding for UMTE modernization in FY 05             2 1 million in federal funds will go to DRS Electronic Warfare and Network Systems  DRS EWNS  Multi spectral Threat Emitter Systems   The mobile MTES  s will support a number of East Coast electronic warfare training ranges for stand alone and joint force exercises  The multi spectral aspects of MTES have the ability to stimulate multiple aircraft sensors with one EW threat simulator on the ground  A MTES yields a higher return on investment for the Government and it meets joint force guidelines for training characteristics            2 5 million in federal funds will go to the Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center for the Lens X Hypervelocity Ground Testing facility  CUBRC has designed and tested a prototype of a revolutionary ground test facility capable of performing ground testing of full scale missile and space systems at Mach numbers from 10 to 22  These funds will fully complete  instrument and test this facility prior to the demonstration of its performance in investigating the communication  guidance and aero heating problems associated with advanced missile and space systems to mitigate the risks and costs associated with the new hypervelocity missile systems in initial development by the DOD  CUBRC is a strategic partnership whose mission is to bring together scientists and engineers from academia and industry to provide the synergism to expand the research capabilities of all and provide significant growth opportunities in Western New York  CUBRC received  2 5 million of federal funding in FY 05             1 million in federal funds will go to General Dynamics and CUBRC for Acute Care of Blast Effects   Head Injuries   There is an urgent immediate requirement for research and data collection to address the acute care of blast effects   head injuries   As a result of the specific war fighting environment experience in Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Operation Enduring Freedom  there have been over 600 neurosurgical combat and combat related injuries   Of over 400 blast cases screened for concussion between March 2004 and today  over 50  exhibit persistent symptoms   A specific focused effort is required to address the immediate combat care  especially Level 1 through Level 3  of these combat trauma patients   Over the long term  an Institute for Military Neurotrauma Research dedicated to improving prevention and treatment efforts of neurotrauma in our soldiers is needed            2 million in federal funds will go to NanoDynamics  Inc  for the development of portable SOFC JP 8 Demonstrators  The Army has identified a critical need for ultra lightweight man portable power  chargers  and power management for dismounted soldiers  This project will demonstrate the validity of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell  SOFC  power generation technology that utilizes JP 8 and other commonly available military fuels  The Portable SOFC JP 8 demonstrator will develop 200 to 300 Watts in a low weight and volume  safe  reliable and cost effective power source that will increase the Future Force Warrior s tactical sustainability and survivability            2 million in federal funds will go to Carwell Products for their Army Corrosion Prevention and Control program and Marine Corps Corrosion Prevention and Control program  The  1 million for Carwell  s Army Corrosion Prevention and Control program will expand the Army  s highly successful Corrosion Prevention and Control Program and establish Corrosion Control Centers and mobile Corrosion Service Teams at Army high density vehicle locations  This effort will be expanded to include Army Prepositioned Stocks as well  The  1 million for the Marine Corps Corrosion Prevention and Control program will establish and operate Corrosion Service Centers  CSC  at Camp Lejeune  North Carolina  Camp Pendleton  California  Camp Kinser  Japan  Camp Smith  Hawaii  and ship facilities at Blount Island  FL and Albany  GA  These Corrosion Prevention and Control programs focus on extending the useful life of Army and Marine Corps equipment by reducing maintenance requirements and associated costs due to corrosion damage            1 5 million in federal funds will go to Buffalo BioBlower   The Bio Blower destroys airborne biological agents by sterilizing the air  It is specifically applicable for any situation where a continuous supply of clean air is essential   The device can potentially eradicate a wide range of biological pathogens  such as anthrax  smallpox  SARS  influenza  tuberculosis and other toxic airborne species   The device is also applicable to battlefield operations  such as tents  command headquarters and enclosed armored vehicles   The Bio Blower is a modified Roots blower pump capable of extremely high gas flow rates  up to hundreds of cubic feet per minute   This recompressive process uniformly increases the temperature of the entire volume of gas  almost instantaneously   Funding is required to design  test and build prototypes for testing in a real environment to optimize performance and finalize mission requirements
