                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Will Chair Companion Hearings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY   Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  and Congressman Jerrold Nadler  NY 08   Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties  announced today that they will conduct companion hearings into the failures of the Federal government in responding to the environmental crisis that resulted from the September 11  2001 World Trade Center attacks    For over five years  Clinton and Nadler have staunchly criticized the Administration s misleading public statements about post 9 11 air quality  as well as its continued failure to provide a proper testing and cleaning of indoor spaces contaminated by WTC toxins and its lack of provision of health care for the thousands of people who are ill as a result of exposure to the pollutants             These hearings represent the first comprehensive Congressional oversight investigations into these environmental matters since the immediate aftermath of the attacks   While in the Majority  Republican House leadership steadfastly refused to hold a single hearing on this matter  or even respond to a written request made in September 2003 by Nadler  then Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi  and then Ranking Members John Conyers  John Dingell  George Miller  and Henry Waxman   Read More              We need to examine what went wrong and assess whether the federal government is better prepared to respond to environmental hazards in future disasters   said Senator Clinton    I also remain concerned about potential indoor contamination resulting from the collapse of the World Trade Center and want to take a close look at the EPA s inadequate program to test and clean residential areas in Manhattan            Finally  we have an opportunity to hear  on the record and first hand  who in the federal government was really responsible for key decisions about the handling of post 9 11 air quality   And from there we can finally learn why those decisions were made    decisions that are still having an impact on 9 11 victims today   said Nadler    The lack of thorough Congressional oversight thus far has allowed for years finger pointing and evading of responsibility on the part of the Federal government  but now is time for the truth  We must  at long last  get to the bottom of these matters  so we can do what is right for the heroes of 9 11  and ensure that we prevent anything like this from ever happening again   he added          The House hearing is scheduled to take place on Tuesday  May 22  2007  at 10 00 A M  in Room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office Building  and will examine the federal post 9 11 environmental response and related possible violations of the  substantive due process rights  of individuals living and working in the vicinity of the World Trade Center on  or after  September 11  2001   In a recent decision  the U S  District Court for the Southern District of New York found that former EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman s falsely reassuring and misleading statements of safety after the September 11  2001 attacks were  without question conscience shocking    The court also found the facts  support an allegation of a violation of the substantive due process right to be free from official government policies that increase the risk of bodily harm  by Whitman s misstatements regarding the air quality of the affected area   An EPA Inspector General review reached similar conclusions   Invited to

 Environmental Protection Agency programs to test and clean indoor spaces in lower Manhattan   The hearing will also examine lessons learned from 9 11 and federal readiness to respond to releases of hazardous substances in future emergencies    The hearing is expected to include testimony from EPA and CEQ officials  as well as affected New Yorkers and scientific experts
