January 25  2007 Senator Clinton Questions Defense Secretary William Perry  Ambassador Dennis Ross  and General Jack Keane on Iraq Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator Clinton  Thank you  And I want to thank each of our witnesses for your lifetime of service to our country and thank you very much for spending so much time with us and with other committees        Obviously  you can see clearly the anguish of members of this committee and other committees before whom you have appeared  No one wants to see this situation descend into even greater blood shed and violence or a failed state  We understand that this is a direct threat to American national  vital interests  as well as a very tragic outcome for the intervention that we commenced  The problem we re having and the reason for this debate is to try to figure out what Congress can usefully contribute to this  Again  we have no illusions that the President is going forward with his policy  several of you said that  The troops are moving  The policy is being implemented  But I have three concerns that I would just like you to briefly respond to        First  we are confronted  and General Keane was eloquent and I know how much it pained you to describe the failures of this strategy in the past  I would personally appreciate any insights any of you might have into why the strategy failed and why we allowed that failure to continue  Clearly I have strong opinions about the failure of oversight and accountability in the Congress  but within the decision making circles of both the civilian and military leadership of our country  why was this failed strategy maintained when it became evident to many people that it was not working  Because I think if we don t understand that  we re going to be sitting here in a year  once again  talking about another strategy that  for whatever reason  has not yet succeeded       Secondly and this perhaps goes directly to General Keane  What is behind the decision to have joint command   You were right on point about the necessity for the unity of command  There s an article in today s New York Times that I think illustrates the difficulty our forces are going to confront  where once again  joint US Iraqi patrol on Haifa street  which has changed hands so often they can t keep up with it  and it became very clear that it was hard to know who was in charge  who was supposed to be making the decisions  who the enemy was  There is a troubling quote from a Sergeant First Class   Who the hell is shooting at us  Who s shooting at us  Do we know who they are   Is it Sunni  Is it Shiite  Is it  in fact some of the Iraqi soldiers who showed up and then disappeared  And there is a very strong argument just based on this one story that turning and expecting to have that cooperative unity  or lack of unity of command  instead of having the kind of command structure that I think that you would recommend  we re going to have a chaotic command structure  which I think plants the seeds of disaster from the level of the street fighting all the way up        Thirdly  I believe strongly in trying to hold the Iraqis to  whether we call them benchmarks or conditions  and I absolutely agree with Ambassador Ross that we ve had no consequences for non performance  And we have squandered a lot of the leverage that we have had  I think that our failure to impose any kind of conditions on our continuing funding of the Iraqi security forces and even the personal security for members of the Iraqi government is one piece of leverage that we ve abdicated  So I understand the argument that the proponents of this policy are making  We use military force  putting our young men and women into situations  like the street fight in Haifa  to try to quell the insurgents and change the behavior of the Sunnis who are supporting them  so that we can get the Maliki government secure enough to decide that it s willing to reach out to the Sunnis  who having been in some respect quelled  are going to be more responsive to such efforts on political reconciliation and that s how we are going to reach the point where we can begin to resolve these outstanding differences  I mean  it sounds like a very complicated process that I am dubious can have success  So would just briefly could you just comment on some of those points  perhaps Dr  Perry you could start       Dr  Perry   I must say that I m appalled by a decision to move forward on the Baghdad operation without a joint command   The operation is called Operation Together Forward and to be together forward we really need a joint command  So  General Keane has said  and I hope he is right that General Petraeus will do what he can do to mitigate that problem  but it is still a problem         Secondly  I testified before I think even with the increment troops that are being added there will be too few to do the job   Again  General Keane has said that there is a strategy for dealing with that problem and I think it s a very innovative strategy  which is to focus on the mixed Sunni Shiite neighborhood  of which there are fewer than 2 million people   And so if you focus on 2 million people  then maybe you will have enough to do the job  I think that is our best chance of success there and I wish General Petraeus well on being able to achieve that  but it is a long shot and I wish so much was not hinging on what I consider to be a long shot         And in any event  whatever we do militarily  if we cannot get the Maliki government to move forward  meaningfully and effectively on political reconciliation  I think it doesn t matter whether we have three brigades or five brigades or seven brigades  it will not be enough to deal with the problem   I have strongly believed that we need to move forward with political reconciliation and security jointly  not wait  not do the security hoping we can do the political reconciliation later  Thank you         Ambassador Ross   I ll just make two quick comments on your first set of observations about why the strategy failed and why we held on to a failed strategy for so long  I think there s no doubt we went in with far too few forces and we went in with far too optimistic assumptions  And we ignored what the nature of the real sectarian divide was and how you re going to have to cope with that  which really leads me to the last set of observations you made        The fundamental problem we face today and  Dr  Perry was just saying it  is the lack of reconciliation and the lack of prospect for it   I see little sign that this Shiite government is interested in it and the only way to change their behavior is for them to see that they have a lot to lose if they don t  So we have to find a way to strike the balance between not necessarily having the lid come off  because they aren t sufficiently uncomfortable with how things are  and yet convince them that they re going to end up producing the very scenario that could end up threaten them   Somehow  if we don t produce consequence  if we don t hold them to a standard of performance  and I say since they  themselves have promised it  let s hold them to what they  themselves have said  And I see no reason why the Congress can t  in fact  use their own words now as a standard by which to judge their performance and to create a set of consequences if they don t act       General Keane   I appreciate the thoughtful questions  They re not easy to deal with   The why the failed strategy   in my own mind  I think we  right from the beginning  we were executing an ideology dealing with the level of force of taking the minimal application of force  This happened in Afghanistan  in my judgment  when we put the force levels in there following the collapse of the Taliban and we were only willing to commit the minimum force to deal with it   Actually  in my own view it was a lack of sufficient force   It wasn t even enough and it s not surprising that the Taliban are able to resurge and commit and exploit the vulnerabilities that exist because of it         So  here comes Iraq and a very successful invasion  in what I believe was the appropriate level of force  Not everyone agreed with that  but the Joint Chiefs all had their finger prints on the level of force that was applied for the invasion  We backed into the insurgency in a sense we didn t see it coming  I think you can hold us  as senior leaders  accountable for not at least reasoning that this is one of those options that they could select  that we should ve had plans to deal with that and if we had plans we would have intellectually thought about how to do this and what s more importantly  we would have had a force list of the kind of forces and the size of forces we would need to deal with it  And then  if it began to materialize  we would have been ready with a much different size of force and also the character of the force in terms of its content would ve been different  So  that was wrong  But then as we got into this thing  I believed this minimal ideology in terms of applying force was in play  And we developed what I call  a short war strategy designed to rush to a political objective when the political culture is not ready for a truly representative government  And that s one of our challenges that we re here now  We re trying to get them to do this  but the truth is they don t have the political maturity to deal with the true representative government   So  that was one issue and I think a mistake        The second one was the military strategy  I believe without saying so  as I look at this  we made up our minds  Without publicly saying so  we made up our minds that  look it  if we go after this insurgency and try to defeat the insurgency with U S  forces in the lead  by every sense of the word  will be a protracted conflict that would go on for years and will eventually erode the American people s will and we ll have to keep high force levels for a long time there and the adverse impact on the Army and Marine Corps  would be significant  And I think that was in play  without ever being put on the table  So we had a short war strategy politically and then a short war strategy militarily because we made the conscience decision to turn it over to the Iraqis to let them do it  thinking that we could get them trained up in sufficient time so we could then exit and they would be   their readiness would be our exit strategy   The problem with that is when I look at it  and I was still supporting it myself in zero five  I knew it had risk associated with it  But in zero five we began to have enough evidence to know that the enemy was exploiting that strategy because we were not protecting the people  ourselves  The Iraqis could not and they began to raise that level of violence beyond anything that we had envisioned that the Iraqis would have to be able to deal with   So right then  I think in hindsight  we knew the strategy could fail   Even before the general election  we knew that the military strategy was failing and we should ve started to make an adjustment to it and say  look it  the only way to bring this level of violence down is we have to begin to secure this population and keep these thugs and killers off of them   To do that would ve meant what   More troops  And I just think that was off the table clearly  It was just not an item that was on the table         And I also believe this Senator  that the military leaders themselves   I don t buy this argument that Rumsfeld was muscling on Generals and therefore they did not have the moral courage to request more forces  but somehow knew they all need more forces  I believe that General Casey and General Abizaid  they re thoughtful people  they were committed to the strategy and they believe it could work  And when you commit yourself to something and you re working an eighteen twenty hour day  and you have nothing nurturing your life whatsoever  except this one singular mission that you re absorbed with  And there s nothing else in your life but this  and you re looking for some measures of success for all of this effort that you re expending  not just yourself  but this entire force  you re going to see some things that are looking okay to you  And you have a tendency to fall prey to that and to make more out of that than what it should be and you deny seeing some of the things  the harsh reality of what s taking place   I m not making excuses   I m just trying to explain the human dynamics of this thing   You know  how very good people  who have had good judgment in the past  can make some mistakes               Read more
