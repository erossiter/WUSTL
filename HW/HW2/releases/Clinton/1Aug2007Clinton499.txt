August 1  2007 Senator Clinton Responds to Vice President Cheney                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Cheney Said He  Agreed  with Edelman s  Good Letter   Washington  DC  During a television interview yesterday  Vice President Dick Cheney was asked what he thought about the letter that Under Secretary of Defense Eric Edelman sent to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in May  in which the Under Secretary outrageously impugned the Senators patriotism by suggesting that Congressional oversight emboldens Americas enemies   In response to the question  Vice President Cheney stated that he  agreed with the letter Eric Edelman wrote  and added  I thought it was a good letter     The Vice Presidents statement contradicts those of Secretary of Defense Gates  who wrote to Senator Clinton that it is the position of the Administration that congressional oversight of the war in Iraq is essential to our national debate  and offered to brief Congress on re deployment planning    Today  Senator Clinton responded to Vice President Cheney     August 1  2007   The Honorable Richard B  Cheney  Vice President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  Vice President    There are few matters I take more seriously as a Senator and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee than the safety and security of our troops   After four years of mismanagement and mistakes by the Bush Administration in Iraq  I believe it is not only important  but imperative that Congress actively oversee the administrations Iraq policy   That is why I feel it is necessary to respond to several comments and inaccuracies you put forward in your most recent interview with CNN    In May  I sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates making a simple  serious request  provide the appropriate oversight committees in Congress  including the Senate Armed Services Committee  with briefings on current contingency plans for the future withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq  or explain why no such planning is taking place    I received a response from Under Secretary of Defense Eric Edelman  who avoided my question   Instead  his letter impugned my patriotism and suggested that congressional oversight emboldens our enemies      I then reiterated my request to Secretary Gates in a second letter  urging him to reject this kind of political attack and to answer my initial request regarding planning for the withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq   In a conciliatory response  Secretary Gates expressed regret that this important discussion went astray and reaffirmed his commitment to Congress s constitutional oversight role    In my initial request  I noted my concern that various members of the administration had stated that contingency planning was not taking place and I requested a briefing on the matter   Your contention that I asked to reveal operational plans is a misrepresentation   In fact  as a result of my inquiry  the Pentagon will be briefing the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow on this topic  without fear that operational security will be imperiled   I have never requested operational plans  My request  which has been honored  is to be briefed on redeployment planning to protect the safety of our troops in what will be a dangerous and complicated series of events    Your comments  agreeing with Under Secretary Edelman  not Secretary Gates  have left me wondering about the true position of the Administration   Therefore  I am writing to President Bush asking that he set the record straight about the Administration s position regarding the role of Congress in oversight of the war      Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton     Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
