December 13  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Energy Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Once again  President Bush and Senate Republicans have chosen to defend oil company profits instead of standing with consumers and moving toward a clean energy future   President Bush issued a veto threat because the energy bill would have eliminated oil company tax breaks in order to fund wind and other clean energy sources   Senate Republicans fell in line and blocked the bill   I was proud to stand up to the President and cast my vote for eliminating oil company subsidies in order to start America on a path to greater energy independence   We need to reduce energy costs for American consumers  reduce greenhouse gas emissions  and create new clean energy jobs  This bill is an important step in that direction   It would raise auto fuel economy standards for the first time in over 30 years  to 35 miles per gallon by 2020  and it would raise the production of biofuels to 36 billion gallons by 2022   I urge my Republican colleagues to reverse course and support this vital legislation
