May 8  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the Senate s Action to Undermine Proposed Prescription Drug Reimportation Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Yesterday  the Senate voted to add the provisions of Senator Dorgan and Snowe s Pharmaceutical Access and Drug Safety Act  legislation I am proud to cosponsor  to S  1082  the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act  The amendment would establish the framework through which we could reimport drugs from other nations where regulatory authority is similar to that in our country  allowing millions of Americans to safely obtain medically necessary drugs at lower cost  I voted for this amendment  and was disappointed to see its provisions undermined             Americans pay higher prices for the exact same prescription drugs being taken by their counterparts in Canada and Europe  The Congressional Budget Office has found that prices for brand name prescription drugs are 35 55 percent higher in the United States  but that adoption of the reimportation legislation I support would save consumers  50 billion in just the next ten years          This price disparity affects millions of Americans  Our seniors  many of whom are on fixed incomes  end up spending larger portions of their income on drugs  especially when falling into the  doughnut hole  or wrestling with other gaps in a Medicare Part D benefit  And this isn t only a problem for seniors   we have 46 million uninsured individuals in our country  many of whom are unable to afford prescription drugs  Without these drugs  manageable chronic conditions  like asthma or high blood pressure  spiral out of control into serious health problems           The Dorgan Snowe amendment contains many provisions that will ensure safety while giving Americans access to cheaper drugs  This bipartisan provision will allow Americans to safely access drugs from Canada starting 90 days after enactment  It will provide the needed authority and funding to the FDA to regulate foreign pharmacies and wholesalers  so that we can be sure that any drugs that enter the United States are safe for our citizens  And it will increase the consumer protections involved with internet pharmacies  so that people who don t live near the border can access imported drugs without being defrauded          Opponents of reimportation amended the underlying Dorgan Snowe bill to require the Secretary to certify that importation is safe   a certification that is unnecessary  and so vaguely worded as to be impossible to meet  In fact  the Congressional Budget Office reports that the  50 billion in savings from reimportation legislation will be eliminated through this certification provision   Within the framework set up by the Dorgan Snowe legislation  only FDA approved drugs would be imported  and measures to ensure additional safety  such as the use of tamper resistant and anti counterfeit packaging  as well as tracking and tracing technologies  would be implemented           We need to make drug reimportation safe  we need to make drug reimportation unambiguously legal  and we need to do so as quickly as possible  The Pharmaceutical Access and Drug Safety Act would allow us to do all of those things  and I will continue to work to ensure that Americans can obtain affordable and safe prescription drug medications from Canada
