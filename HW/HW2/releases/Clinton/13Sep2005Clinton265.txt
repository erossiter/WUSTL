September 13  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Vote to Overturn Administration Mercury Rule for Power Plants                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC     The EPA  s mercury rule protects power plant owners rather than children   It is illegal and should be overturned   The Administration worked with industry to develop the rule  and then instructed EPA analysts to work to produce economic and scientific analysis to support it   The result is that the rule would give power plant owners an extra decade to continue to emit mercury pollution  and mothers and their children will pay the price            Mercury is a potent neurotoxin  and mercury pollution is a serious problem in New York   In April  the New York State Department of Health declared that New Yorkers shouldn  t eat any fish caught in the Adirondacks or Catskills because of the danger posed by mercury contamination   EPA  s own models show that between 30 and 60 percent of mercury deposition in New York is from domestic sources  with power plants being by far the largest contributor   To restore our lakes and protect our children  we need mercury reductions faster and stronger than the Administration  s rule would produce
