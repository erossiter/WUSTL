                                                                                                                                                                                                                      September 11th Attacks  Hurricane Katrina and Other Disasters Highlight Need to Address Conditions like Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Depression  Especially in Children      Senator Introduces Legislation to Create National Center for Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today introduced legislation to help prepare first responders and health care professionals to effectively address mental health consequences in the wake of public health emergencies  like those created after the September 11th attacks and Hurricane Katrina           The Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2006 would establish the National Center for Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness to coordinate the development and delivery of mental health services in collaboration with existing federal  state and local entities when our nation is confronted with public health catastrophes             The attacks on September 11th and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have sadly taught us that our current resources are not sufficient or coordinated enough to meet the mental health needs of those devastated by emergency events     Senator Clinton said    We need to support and train our mental health professionals  our first responders  and our local and state leaders and develop effective mechanisms for them to mobilize and deploy the necessary health resources in times of emergency             According to news reports just this week  a Columbia University Barnard College survey again revealed that the attacks on September 11th had a substantial impact on children in lower Manhattan  with about one in six downtown preschoolers and nearly 60  of parents of children in day care centers and preschools receiving mental health counseling following the attacks          The Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness Act of 2006 would create the National Center for Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness  National Center  and charge it with four functions to address mental health problems and co ordinate the development and delivery of mental health services in conjunction with existing federal  state and local entities in the event of a public health emergency          Under the bill  the National Center for Public Mental Health Emergency Preparedness would work to establish and disseminate up to date and effective training curricula to help emergency health professionals across the country at the state and local levels  including mental health professionals  public health and healthcare professionals  emergency services personnel  county emergency managers  school personnel  spiritual care professionals  and State and local government officials responsible for emergency preparedness           The legislation would also establish the National Center as a clearinghouse of educational materials  guidelines  and research on public mental health emergency preparedness and service delivery  Technical assistance would be provided to help users access those resources most effective for their communities           In addition  the bill would task the National Center with creating an annual national forum for emergency health professionals  researchers  other experts and federal  state and local government officials to identify and address gaps in science  practice  policy and education related to public mental health emergency preparedness and service delivery          Finally  the Public Mental Health Preparedness Act would require annual evaluations of both the National Center  s efforts and those across the federal government in building our nation  s public mental health emergency preparedness and service delivery capacity  Based on these evaluations  recommendations would be made to improve mental health strategies and resources            It is clear that the consequences of emergency events like hurricanes and terrorist attacks result in increased emotional suffering among survivors and responders  and we must do more to assist all who are affected     Senator Clinton said     We must not wait until another disaster strikes before we take action to improve the way we respond to the psychological needs of affected Americans             Senator Clinton  s bill is supported by the American Public Health Association  APHA  http   clinton senate gov documents mental_health_preparedness pdf          Last week Senator Clinton also introduced the Heroes at Home Act of 2006  legislation aimed at enhancing support and services for U S  troops transitioning back home after deployment in Iraq and Afghanistan  Senator Clinton  s bill proposes four key initiatives to assist military service members of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom with readjustment to work  the problems of posttraumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues  and traumatic brain injury  The bill  which is supported by the National Military Family Association and the Wounded Warrior Project  also provides support to their family members
