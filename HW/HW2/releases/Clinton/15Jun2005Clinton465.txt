June 15  2005 Corzine  Snowe and Clinton Introduce Bill Requiring Hospitals to Offer Rape Victims Emergency Contraception                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       CARE  Act would ensure women are   offered necessary medical care and treatment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    U S  Senators Jon S  Corzine  NJ   Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and Olympia Snowe  ME  today introduced legislation to ensure that survivors of rape have access to and information about emergency contraception  The Compassionate Assistance for Rape Emergencies Act  or CARE Act  would also make certain that women receive the necessary medical care to prevent sexually transmitted diseases        Last year  the U S  Department of Justice released its first medical guidelines for the treatment of rape victims  but absent from the 141 page protocol were references to emergency contraception as a potential option for sexual assault victims  In contrast  protocols for sexual assault victims developed by public health employees at the Centers for Disease Control included access to emergency contraception         In another example of how the Bush Administration is playing politics with women s health  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has refused to make a decision on whether the  morning after  pill  also known as Plan B  should be available over the counter  Today s press conference on emergency contraception follows a confirmation vote in a Senate Committee on Lester M  Crawford  President Bush s nominee to head the FDA  Frustrated by the FDA s refusal to make a yes or no decision about the over counter availability of Plan B  Senators Clinton and Patty Murray  D WA  have indicated that they plan to put a hold on Dr  Crawford s confirmation vote on the Senate floor          Ideology should never stand between a patient and appropriate medical care  We need to make sure that hospitals present to the survivors of sexual assault every treatment option   said Senator Corzine   It is simply unacceptable that a rape victim s care depends on which hospital she is taken  This legislation will help sexual assault survivors across the country receive the medical care they need and deserve          With an estimated 300 000 women the victims of sexual assault each year  we must do everything in our power to ensure that they have every health care option at their disposal  Every survivor deserves the appropriate treatment to ensure that they are not faced with the injustice of insufficient care  With this legislation  we have put the lives and safety of victims first   said Snowe          Rape survivors have already suffered immeasurably and the last thing they should worry about is the quality of medical care they will receive  Each victim deserves the very best treatment and complete access to all the necessary resources and support services   Senator Clinton said   This legislation will remove road blocks and provide real options for rape victims  Emergency contraception is a valuable tool that can prevent unintended pregnancy         U S  Representatives Steve Rothman  D NJ  and Rob Simmons  R CT   who also spoke at the press conference  have introduced a companion version of the bill in the House of Representatives         Also speaking at the conference was Karen D  Carroll  a registered nurse from Westchester County  New York  Ms  Carroll  a licensed nurse for 27 years  has spoken before dozens of health and law enforcement officials about sexual assault  and is currently responsible for coordinating the recruitment and training for a program that provides forensic examinations 24 hours per day  7 days a week to patients in need  She is also a survivor of marital rape        Every two minutes a woman is sexually assaulted in the U S  and an estimated 25 000 victims become pregnant as a result  By providing access to emergency contraception  88 to 95 percent of those unintended pregnancies could be prevented if emergency contraception is administered within the first 24 to 72 hours        Emergency contraception works by inhibiting ovulation or fertilization  or by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg before a pregnancy can occur  It cannot terminate an established pregnancy  nor will it affect the developing pre embryo or embryo        In addition to providing emergency contraception  the bill ensures that patients can receive post exposure treatment for sexually transmitted diseases  Some diseases  including HIV and hepatitis B  cannot be reliably cured if treatment is deferred  yet can be prevented if post exposure drugs or vaccines are administered soon after the assault         In the Senate  the CARE Act now heads to the Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions
