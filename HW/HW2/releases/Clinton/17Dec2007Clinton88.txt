December 17  2007 Clinton  Schumer  Lautenberg  Menendez  Nadler  Maloney  Fossella Announce Senate and House Approval of  108 Million to Expand Health Coverage for 9 11 Emergency Responders and Others                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Funding Comes as Thousands of Patients are Seeking Treatment for 9 11 Related Illnesses  with Numbers Rising   Funds to Expand Treatment to Residents  Office and Commercial Workers  Students  and Other Individuals                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  Frank Lautenberg  and Robert Menendez  along with Representatives Jerrold Nadler  Carolyn Maloney  and Vito Fossella today announced that the House and Senate Appropriations Committees have approved an additional  108 million in federal funding to address the mounting health needs of those individuals who were exposed to environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  The money builds on the  50 million that was provided in the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that was signed into law earlier this year  bringing total funding for the year to  158 million    The latest funding increase includes  51 5 million in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill and  56 5 million in additional emergency spending  The bill  having been approved by the House Senate Appropriations Committees  will now return to both chambers of Congress for final passage  whereupon it will be sent to the President for his signature    The terrible tragedy of September 11th continues to affect New Yorkers  from heroic first responders who rushed into the toxic cloud to search for survivors and have now become victims themselves  to residents who became ill even as they tried to rebuild the fabric of lower Manhattan  I am proud to have stood with them for six years as the lasting health effects of the terrorist attacks became clearer and clearer  Todays announcement marks another step toward addressing these enduring wounds  Senator Clinton said  I strongly urge the President to abandon his veto threat  The New Yorkers and first responders from across the country who answered the call in our time of need have suffered enough and dont deserve to be caught in the middle of a political squabble    I urge the President to rescind his veto threat against this essential funding  which will enhance medical monitoring and treatment for our heroic 9 11 first responders  More than six years after the attacks  some first responders have developed debilitating conditions and diseases that will require long term care  They did not abandon us in our time of need  and we must not abandon them  I am heartened that this additional funding has been set aside for their treatment  and will press the fight for every dime needed to get this job done right  Senator Schumer said    First responders  emergency workers and volunteers showed true courage during the recovery effort after the 9 11 terrorist attacks  Now  many of these brave men and women are suffering serious illnesses from the toxins at Ground Zero  I urge the President to rethink his irresponsible veto threat so these heroes can get the treatment they deserve  said Senator Lautenberg    This funding will help address the needs of all those who deserve their government s attention and resources  whether they developed symptoms in the days after 9 11 or in the years after 9 11  said Senator Menendez   We must never forget  means that the federal government cannot ignore it s duty to care for those who are suffering just because six years have passed  After a long period of federal inaction  this year Congress has begun to deliver the type of commitment that these victims of 9 11 deserve  We cannot rest until all of those who inhaled the toxic dust around Ground Zero are examined and those found to be sick are treated    This landmark funding is a tremendous step toward caring for those who  six years later   are still suffering as a result of the 9 11 attacks on our nation  said Congressman Nadler   As Abraham Lincoln said  we must care for him who shall have borne the battle   We must also continue fighting for comprehensive health benefits for all those who have become sick as a result of the collapse of the World Trade Center  whether they be first responders  local residents  office workers  or students   And we must ensure a full and proper clean up of all affected areas  so that no more innocent people will be harmed by the environmental scars of 9 11    This landmark bill would for the very first time ensure a full years funding for federal 9 11 health clinics  said Congresswoman Maloney   In addition  these funds will help provide care not only to 9 11 responders  but to lower Manhattan residents  workers and students  as well   The New York delegation worked hard to make sure that in 2008  9 11 health clinic doctors wont have to worry about keeping their doors open   I urge the President to support this funding and sign this important bill     This funding will finally provide medical monitoring and treatment to all the unsung heroes of 9 11  including 9 11 responders  area workers  residents and others  It is also an important step forward in fulfilling our responsibility to help all those who are sick today as well as those who become ill in the future  said Congressman Vito Fossella    The  108 million in new funding will go towards monitoring and treatment activities administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  to help those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released on and after 9 11  The  51 5 million portion in the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  HHS  Appropriations Bill also includes statutory language requiring the Department of Health and Human Services  through NIOSH  to expand the program beyond responders and rescue workers to entities that would provide services to residents  office and commercial workers  students  and other individuals who were exposed  Existing programs to serve those who were impacted include the centers in the Mount Sinai Consortium and the program run by the New York City Fire Department    The lawmakers said that the approved funding is a recognition of the importance of addressing the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  and affirms the commitment of the federal government to provide assistance to those whose physical and mental health was adversely impacted as a result of this exposure  More than six years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among those who have been exposed
