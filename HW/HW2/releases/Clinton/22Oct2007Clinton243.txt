                Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Department of Veterans  Affairs  VA  to explain and rectify reported delays in care for wounded veterans   According to news reports  veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan  including those needing critical care  are suffering long wait times for medical appointments at VA facilities   As the White House has not yet named a Veterans Secretary Designate  Senator Clinton today asked Acting Secretary of VA Gordon Mansfield to clarify the situation and identify actions being taken to reduce these delays        It is our solemn responsibility to ensure that our nations veterans receive the best possible health care  delivered in a timely fashion  Senator Clinton wrote   Those who have sacrificed so much deserve our deepest appreciation and respect  but they also deserve and should expect our best care and support when seeking treatment at VA facilities      In sending the letter  Senator Clinton underscored the need for permanent leadership at the VA  The problems at the VA demonstrate the urgency of filling the position of VA secretary as soon as possible   I urge the White House to nominate a suitable candidate for the Department of Veterans Affairs as soon as possible  Senator Clinton said    As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform and their families have the healthcare and support they need  most recently securing a series of measures in the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act approved unanimously by the Senate   Senator Clinton also has introduced legislation approved by Congress to extend family and medical leave to six months for families of wounded servicemembers  implementing a key recommendation of the Dole Shalala Commission on the Care for Wounded Warriors     The following is the text of Senator Clintons letter to Acting Secretary Mansfield     October 22  2007   The Honorable Gordon H  Mansfield  Acting Secretary  U S  Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20420   Dear Mr  Secretary    I write to you with great concern regarding recent reports that a significant number of veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are having to endure long waiting times for medical appointments at Veterans Affairs  VA  facilities   According to these reports  the problem is particularly acute for veterans requiring critical care   For instance  waiting times for 24  of appointments for traumatic brain injury  TBI  care reportedly exceeded 30 days   It is our solemn responsibility to ensure that our nations veterans receive the best possible health care  delivered in a timely fashion   I hope that you can clarify whether these reported delays are in fact occurring for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans  and if so  identify what actions are being taken to reduce waiting times      This news is particularly disturbing in light of a September VA Inspector General report that concluded that the Veterans Health Administration  VHA  had understated waiting times for medical appointments for veterans of all eras   According to the Inspector Generals report  25  of the veterans whose cases were reviewed had to wait more than 30 days for an appointment   Further  the report concluded that five of the eight recommendations made by the Inspector General in July 2005  recommendations that were intended to address the VHAs underreporting of waiting times and to increase the speed with which veterans receive care  have not been implemented    Those who have sacrificed so much deserve our deepest appreciation and respect  but they also deserve and should expect our best care and support when seeking treatment at VA facilities   Again  I hope that you can clarify whether the reported delays are in fact occurring  what actions are being taken to reduce waiting times  and the status of implementation of the Inspector Generals July 2005 recommendations on this issue    Thank you for your consideration of my concerns on this extremely important matter   I look forward to continuing to work with you in support of all our nations veterans    Sincerely yours   Hillary Rodham Clinton   cc  Josh Bolten  White House Chief of Staff
