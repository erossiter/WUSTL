May 16  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding U S  Supreme Court Ruling on Interstate Wine Shipments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Today s ruling is a very positive step for New York s wine producers and for the State s economy  Our winemakers make great products  of which we can all be proud  They also have the potential to generate far ranging economic benefits throughout their region by fostering new investment  jobs  tourism  and tax revenue  As I have long argued  the current ban on interstate shipment puts our local producers at a competitive disadvantage  and I am pleased that the U S  Supreme Court held that such laws unconstitutionally discriminate against interstate commerce  Our wines are renowned and in demand throughout the country and the world  and I look forward to doing everything I can to give our winemakers the ability to ship their wines  grow their businesses and satisfy customer demand  Wine making is one of New York s most vital industries  and it is important that we do everything we can to support it
