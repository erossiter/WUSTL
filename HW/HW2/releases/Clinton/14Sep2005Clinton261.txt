                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Senator Clinton  s Legislation Will Provide Support for the Growing Number of Grandparents and Other Relatives Raising Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined grandparents from New York and across the country to honor grandparents and other family caregivers who are raising children   Underscoring that Hurricane Katrina has increased the number of children living with grandparents and other relatives  Senator Clinton called on Congress to pass her kinship care legislation to provide assistance to families where children are being raised by relatives other than their parents             Tragically  in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  the number of children who have been separated from their parents has grown   Grandparents are assuming the responsibility for care and the challenges they endure every day reveal how important it is to provide assistance to grandparents who raise their grandchildren     said Senator Clinton          At the rally  Senator Clinton honored the grandparents and other relatives who take on the responsibility of caregiving despite the financial burden and other challenges   Nationwide  there are six million children in grandparent or other relative headed households   In New York alone  there are almost 300 000   According to the U S  Census  6 3 percent of all children under 18 years old are living in grandparent headed households  a 30 percent increase from 1990 to 2000         Senator Clinton  s Kinship Caregiver Support Act will provide these families with the guidance they need to learn how to obtain health care coverage for the children in their care  apply for housing assistance  locate childcare  enroll children in school  and gain access to other services   It will also make it possible for grandparents and other relatives to care for children who would otherwise be in foster care           Too often  abused or neglected children stay in foster care because grandparents or other relatives who want to become legal caregivers are unable to take on the responsibility unless the children are given up for adoption  This legislation will allow relatives to become formal guardians and to receive some financial assistance     said Senator Clinton          Finally  this legislation will require States to notify grandparents and other close relatives when children enter the foster care system  Unfortunately  grandparents and other relatives often do not know when their grandchildren or nieces and nephews come under the care of the State    Notifying grandparents and other relatives when children enter the foster care system will make it easier for families to stay together     said Senator Clinton         Senator Clinton has been a strong advocate for family caregivers   She was recognized on September 13 with the Cynthia Rose award from the National Committee of Grandparents for Children  s Rights         THE KINSHIP CAREGIVER SUPPORT ACT       Nationwide  more six million children  that is  1 in 12 children  are living in households headed by grandparents or other relatives  i e     kinship caregivers      Kinship caregivers  who often become parents unexpectedly  face unique challenges to successfully raising children  Some of those challenges are financial  others are logistical and or emotional  This bill attempts to address the full range of challenges facing kinship caregivers         Title I  The Kinship Navigator Program        Research has shown that one of kinship caregivers  greatest challenges in raising their children is obtaining accurate information about the services available in their communities  To address this problem  this provision provides 3 year grants to state agencies  agencies serving large metropolitan areas  and Indian tribal organizations to create  kinship navigator  programs  These funds will help              Establish toll free hotlines  websites and resource guides on the state and local parenting support available to kinship families  such as how to enroll children in school  obtain health insurance  safeguard homes for small children  overcome legal issues  and find childcare              Promote partnerships between government organizations  private not for profit agencies  and faith based organizations to help address the fragmentation that creates barriers to helping kinship families              Create kinship care ombudsman who will actively intervene with service providers to help kinship caregivers get the services they need         Title II  Subsidized Guardianship        This provision will make it possible for kin to serve as permanent legal guardians for children who would otherwise be in foster care  States will have the option to use their Title IV E funds to provide payments to grandparents and other relatives who have assumed legal guardianship of children they ve cared for as foster parents  A few states  such as Illinois and Maryland  have implemented subsidized guardianship waivers through the HHS demonstration project  and have shown them to be a cost neutral  effective way to keep families together             To prevent fraud  families would only be permitted to receive subsidized guardianship payments if the child has in foster care for at least 12 months              States will also be required to notify relatives when children enter the foster care system         This legislation is endorsed by the Children s Defense Fund  the Child Welfare League of America  Grandparents for Children s Rights  Generations United  the AARP  the National Caucus of Black State Legislators and the Evan P  Donaldson Adoption Institute
