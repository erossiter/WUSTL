May 24  2006 Schumer  Clinton Commend Department of Commerce Decision on Unfair Trade Practices that Hurt Syracuse Candle Industry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Department Issues Preliminary Determination on Chinese Candle Imports      Syracuse candle industry continually hurt by circumvention efforts by Chinese candle makers and U S  importers to avoid antidumping tariffs                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed a decision today by the U S  Department of Commerce that affirmed anti circumvention was taking place  thereby requiring Chinese candle producers to comply with an Anti dumping Duty Order on their mixed wax imported candles and pay a 108 3  duty on those imports          The Department of Commerce  s preliminary determination effectively orders a 108 3  duty margin on mixed wax candles that contain up to 87 80 percent of palm and or other vegetable oil based waxes  The 108 3  duty will be retroactive to February 25  2005  which was when the investigation commenced             This is a great triumph for our domestic candle producers here in Syracuse   Today the Commerce Department came down on the right side of the issue   their decision means that Chinese candle producers must play by the rules   Although the decision is preliminary  it is a good start  and I would urge the Commerce Department to stay the course when issuing their final determination     Senator Schumer said            This is a real victory for the Syracuse candle making industry   Our manufacturers deserve a level playing field and we owe it to them to make sure that others do not unfairly circumvent our fair trade practices     Senator Clinton said    Syracuse has a proud history of candle production but attempts by importers to undercut our producers have put that tradition at risk  I am pleased that the Department of Commerce heeded our call to take action against these unfair practices and recognized the importance of this decision to local producers  especially here in Syracuse  We will continue to make the case on behalf of Syracuse candle makers as the Commerce Department considers its final determination             Syracuse used to be one of the world  s prime producers of candles  yet their market has steadily declined since the early 1980s    primarily due to Chinese trade practices   Muench Kreuzer  Will   Baumer  and the Cathedral Candle Companies  all located in Syracuse  have alleged that the Chinese have successfully avoided paying antidumping duties on petroleum candles           Last week  Senators Schumer and Clinton joined with a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues  calling on the U S  Department of Commerce to consider the local candle industry before issuing their determination   The senators were concerned about aggressive efforts by Chinese candle producers to circumvent an Antidumping Duty Order on petroleum wax candles and thus avoid paying the 108 3  duty imposed on their illegal dumping  Last year Senators Clinton and Schumer also wrote a letter urging the Department of Commerce to take action and investigate allegations of the Chinese circumvention efforts while expressing great concern towards the potentially irreparable harm these efforts could cause on the U S  candle industry    most notably the candle production in and around Syracuse              A Department of Commerce Fact Sheet on the preliminary determination is below           FACT SHEET         Preliminary Determination in the Anticircumvention Inquiry under the Later Developed Merchandise Provision  Antidumping Duty Order On Petroleum Wax Candles from the People s Republic of China         On May 24  the Department announced its preliminary determination of circumvention of the antidumping duty order on petroleum wax candles from the People  s Republic of China  PRC   In determining whether mixed wax candles composed of petroleum wax and more than fifty percent or more palm and or other vegetable oil based waxes  mixed wax candles  are considered later developed merchandise under section 781 d  of the Tariff Act of 1930  as amended  the Act   the Department evaluated the arguments raised by the interested parties in light of the language of the statute  regulations  and the applicable legislative history   The evidence on the record of this inquiry  taken as a whole  leads to our preliminary determination that mixed wax candles are later developed products of petroleum wax candles  within the meaning of section 781 d  of the Act            However  the Department is unable to conclusively determine whether  and at what point  candles containing increasing proportions of palm and or other vegetable oil based wax may no longer be considered petroleum wax candles   As a result  the Department preliminary finds that only those mixed wax candles that contain up to 87 80 percent of palm and or other vegetable oil based waxes  which is the highest amount within a mixed wax candle that has been made for commercial sale on the record  are within the scope of the antidumping duty order on petroleum wax candles from the PRC  as provided in section 781 d  of the Act          Next Steps   In accordance with its affirmative preliminary determination  the Department will require suspension of liquidation of entries of mixed wax candles containing up to 87 80 percent of palm and or other vegetable oil based waxes mixed with petroleum wax  from the PRC that were entered  or withdrawn from warehouse  for consumption on or after February 25  2005  the date of initiation of this anticircumvention inquiry   The merchandise subject to suspension of liquidation is limited to mixed wax candles   U S Customs and Border Protection  CBP  will require a cash deposit in the amount of 108 30 percent for all such unliquidated entries  which is the most recently calculated PRC wide rate            Following the publication of the preliminary determination  the Department will solicit additional comments and information from interested parties for consideration in the final determination in the following areas               the precise significant technological advancement that allowed for the commercial sale of mixed wax candles             the extent to which the concentration of palm or vegetable based oil wax has any effect on the physical properties of the mixed wax candle as well as the proper characterization of such as candle as a petroleum wax candle             a direct link between patents awarded during this period and commercial sale of mixed wax candles  and             a comprehensive survey showing the technological developments regarding mixed wax candles          The Department will be setting a schedule for the submission of these comments and information in the next two weeks            Minor Alterations Anticircumvention Inquiry  On February 25  2005  the Department also initiated a minor alterations anticircumvention inquiry on mixed wax candles  pursuant to section 781 c  of the Act   Due to the issuance of the preliminary determination that mixed wax candles are a later developed product  the minor alterations inquiry is on hold  but may continue pending the results of the final determination of this later developed merchandise proceeding   However  if the Department determines to affirm the results of this preliminary determination  then the minor alteration anticircumvention proceeding will be rescinded as the products subject to that inquiry would already have been determined to be within the scope pursuant to the instant inquiry           Petitioners   The National Candle Association  petitioners in this proceeding  requested that the Department conduct an anticircumvention inquiry pursuant to section 781 d  of the Act  the later developed provision  on October 8  2004            Product Description
