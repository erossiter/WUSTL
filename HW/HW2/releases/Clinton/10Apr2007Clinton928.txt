April 10  2007 Senator Clinton Introduces Resolution Calling for Opening of Holocaust Archives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today introduced a Senate Resolution urging all European nations to allow for open access to the Holocaust archives in Bad Arolsen  Germany   The records are the largest closed World War II era archives in the world  holding an estimated 50 million records that disclose the fate of some 17 5 million victims   The resolution was introduced in the House by Representative Alcee Hastings  D FL   Chairman of the U S  Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe  Helsinki Commission   of which Senator Clinton is a member   The House Foreign Affairs Committee has unanimously approved the resolution           These records hold the key for millions of families who have tried for more than 60 years to piece together information about the fate of their loved ones   As we approach Holocaust Remembrance Day this Sunday  we should do everything we can to give these families the access they deserve and keep the pressure on countries that have not yet completed the ratification process   said Senator Clinton          To open access to these archives  each of the 11 members of the International Commission of the International Tracing Service  ITS  must individually ratify the May 2006 amendments to the 1955 Bonn Accords   To date  only five of the member countries    the United States  Israel  Poland  the Netherlands  and the U K     have ratified the treaty  Belgium  France  Germany  Greece  Italy  and Luxembourg have not   The annual meeting of the Commission will be held next month          The Senate resolution introduced today is also cosponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown  D OH   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Edward Kennedy  D MA   John Kerry  D MA  and Charles Schumer  D NY           The following is the text of the resolution          S  Res 141         RESOLUTION         Urging all member countries of the International Commission of the International Tracing Service who have yet to ratify the May 2006 amendments to the 1955 Bonn Accords to expedite the ratification process to allow for open access to the Holocaust archives located at Bad Arolsen  Germany           Whereas the International Tracing Service  ITS  archives located in Bad Arolsen  Germany  which are administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross  contain an estimated 50 000 000 records on the fates of some 17 500 000 individual victims of Nazi war crimes          Whereas the ITS archives at Bad Arolsen remain the largest closed Holocaust era archives in the world          Whereas  although access to individual records can be requested by Holocaust survivors and their descendants  many who have requested information from the ITS archives have reported facing significant delays and even unresponsiveness          Whereas the ITS archives remain inaccessible to researchers and research institutions          Whereas the Agreement Constituting an International Commission for the International Tracing Service  signed at Bonn June 6  1955  6 UST 6186   commonly known as the  Bonn Accords   established an international commission of 11 member countries  Belgium  France  Germany  Greece  Israel  Italy  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Poland  the United Kingdom  and the United States  charged with overseeing the administration of the ITS Holocaust archives          Whereas  following years of delay  in May 2006 in Luxembourg  the International Commission of the ITS agreed upon amendments to the Bonn Accords that would allow researchers to use the archives and would allow each member country of the International Commission to receive digitized copies of archive materials and make the records available to researchers under the respective national laws relating to archives and privacy          Whereas the May 2006 amendments to the Bonn Accords require each of the 11 member countries of the International Commission to ratify the amendments before open access to the Holocaust archives is permitted          Whereas  although the final signature was affixed to the amendments in October 2006  only 5 out of the 11 member countries of the International Commission  the United States  Israel  Poland  the Netherlands and the United Kingdom  have ratified the amendments          Whereas the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has for years been working tirelessly to provide public access to the materials in the Bad Arolsen archives          Whereas  on March 8  2007  representatives from the 11 member countries of the International Commission of the ITS met in the Netherlands and reviewed the current ratification status of each country and the ratification process in its entirety          Whereas it is a moral and humanitarian imperative to permit public access to the millions of Holocaust records housed at Bad Arolsen          Whereas it is essential that researchers obtain access while Holocaust survivors are living  so that the researchers can benefit in their scholarly work from the insights of eyewitnesses          Whereas  in the aftermath of the Holocaust  there have been far too many instances of survivors and heirs of Holocaust victims being refused their moral and legal right to information  for restitution purposes  slave labor compensation  and personal closure          Whereas opening the historic records is a vital contribution to the world s collective memory and understanding of the Holocaust and efforts to ensure that the anti Semitism that made such horrors possible is never again permitted to take hold          Whereas anti Semitism has seen a resurgence in recent years  and as recently as December 2006  the President of Iran  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  held the second Holocaust denial conference in Tehran in one year  and         Whereas in light of this conference  the anti Semitic rhetoric of President Ahmadinejad  and a resurgence of anti Semitism in part of the world  the opening of the archives at Bad Arolsen could not be more urgent  Now  therefore  be it      Resolved  That the Senate            1  commends in the strongest terms all countries that have to date ratified the amendments to the Agreement Constituting an International Commission for the International Tracing Service  signed at Bonn June 6  1955  6 UST 6186   commonly known as the  Bonn Accords   to allow for open access to the Holocaust archives of the International Tracing Service  ITS  located at Bad Arolsen  Germany           2  commends the countries that have committed to expedite the process of releasing the archives and expects those countries to abide by their commitments           3  strongly urges all countries that have to yet to ratify the amendments to abide by the treaty obligations made in May 2006 and to expedite the ratification of the amendments           4  strongly urges all member countries of the International Commission of the ITS to consider the short time left to Holocaust survivors and unanimously consent to open the ITS archives should all countries not ratify the amendments by May 2007           5  expresses the hope that bureaucratic and diplomatic processes will not further delay this process  and          6  refuses to forget the murder of 6 000 000 Jews and more than 5 000 000 other victims during the Holocaust by Nazi perpetrators and their collaborators
