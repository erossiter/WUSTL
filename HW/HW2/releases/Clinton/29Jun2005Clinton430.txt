June 29  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Resolution of Disapproval Relating to EPA s Mercury Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Today I joined 29 other Senators in introducing a bipartisan resolution to overturn EPA s mercury rule  which continues to let power plants off the hook when it comes to controlling mercury  In passing this resolution  we are telling the EPA to go back to the drawing board and develop a mercury regulation that will protect the public rather than power plant owners        There is no doubt that emissions of mercury from power plants and other sources are contaminating our food and putting children and families at risk  The Department of Health s various warnings are evidence that we must have tougher mercury controls in place to stop this poison from getting into our environment and our food        In New York  the expanded warnings from the Department of Health against consumption of fish from the Adirondacks and the Catskills were additional proof that the EPA must revise the rule immediately  not just in the interests of the environment  but in the interests of public health
