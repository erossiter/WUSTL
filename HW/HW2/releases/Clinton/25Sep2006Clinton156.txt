                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Many farmers experiencing a workforce crisis which threatens crops and livelihoods   Senator calls for support to pass bipartisan AgJOBS Bill as soon as possible                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Continuing her fight to help New York  s farmers  many of whom are facing a severe and immediate agricultural workforce crisis  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has renewed her call on the Senate to pass meaningful reform to the nation  s agricultural labor system  In a statement  Senator Clinton emphasized the need for immediate action to aid New York farmers who are facing serious labor shortages and stressed the importance of the contribution these farmers make to New York  s economy          Over the past few months  Senator Clinton has heard from farmers across New York who are suffering economically as a result of the current situation  Senator Clinton also recently met in Washington  DC with representatives from New York  s agricultural communities  including New York Apple Sales  Inc   the New York Apple Association  the New York State Horticultural Society and a representative from Torrey Farms in Elba  NY  about this situation           Earlier this month  Senator Clinton also wrote to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid  stressing the urgent need to pass agricultural labor reform legislation  Senator Clinton noted that as the Senate prepares to recess without the passage of comprehensive immigration reform  a crisis is taking hold on New York  s farms          In her statement to the Congressional Record  Senator Clinton urged passage of the bipartisan Agricultural Job Opportunities  Benefits  and Security Act  AgJOBS   which would provide American farmers with the long overdue relief they need to secure an adequate workforce  The AgJOBS bill would not only expand the current H 2A program  it would also modernize its procedures  making it easier for American farmers to use  The legislation would also provide a one time adjustment to legal status for experienced farm workers who are already working in the country but who currently lack legal documentation  The AgJOBS bill has wide bipartisan support           A copy of Senator Clinton  s statement submitted to the Congressional Record follows        STATEMENT OF SENATOR HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON ON AgJOBS      September 21  2006      Mr  President  as I have often reminded my colleagues  New York State is an agricultural state  We are home to 36 000 farms  and our farmers are world class producers of dairy products  apples  grapes  honey  maple syrup  great wines  and other fruits and vegetables  New York is truly a land of milk and honey    and so much more  Agriculture contributes almost  4 billion to New York  s economy  More than 1 2 million people work on farms or in farm related jobs          But farmers in New York who are contributing so much to our economy and way of life    in a plight shared by the agricultural industry across the country    face an incredible challenge to maintain a workforce that does the difficult job of harvesting crops and bringing our state  s bounty to the marketplace           That is why I continue to fight for a solution  And as we consider the Craig and Feinstein amendments  I hope we can keep these farmers    many of whom I have met and worked closely with these past six years    in our focus  and put the politics and partisanship aside  There are those in this chamber who have strong disagreements over how to pursue comprehensive immigration reform  But I hope that these proposals to stand by our family farmers and agricultural industry  both struggling to find labor  are not held hostage to the larger debate           Our farmers have long desired a legal  stable workforce and have been calling for reform  But now they face the prospect of crops dying in the field or on the vine    or worse  their farms going out of business  because of a shortage of workers  We  ve had the best apple crop in years in New York  but the lack of labor has left apples unpicked on the trees  We are in the midst of the harvest season in New York State and the 36 000 farm families face the real risk    this year    of losing their livelihoods if we cannot ensure a legal  stable workforce for them  In fact  according to the Farm Bureau  New York  s agricultural industry stands to lose  289 million with fruit and vegetable growers estimated to lose more than  100 million without a solving this problem           Farmers have shared with me their stories  Many feel abandoned to election year politics  partisan wrangling  and a government that does not recognize their hardship  Our farmers   crops are dying in the fields  We cannot allow a real solution to die on the vine          In recent meetings with scores of New York farmers from across the state  it was stressed to me that the current worker program in place    the H 2A legal guest worker program    is antiquated  unworkable  and woefully inadequate  Couple this with the recent increases in enforcement by the Social Security Administration and the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement  and the result has been major disruptions to our farms           I join with many of my colleagues in this chamber who believe that workplace enforcement is imperative  But as we all know  our current laws are broken and enforcement has been inadequate and haphazard at best  We know this because we have been debating reforms for months  some of us for years  These increases in enforcement have left our farmers reeling  Day to day  they do not know whether their labor force will show up for work  whether their workers have been apprehended by Immigration and Custom Enforcement or whether they have simply fled the area out of fear of apprehension  Whatever the cause  the result is our farms are being paralyzed          It is worth noting that the farmers I have spoken with are trying in good faith to obey the law  They get labor referrals from the New York State Department of Labor  They inspect work documents to ensure that they have a legal workforce  Our farmers are on the losing end of a broken system and it  s up to us to fix it           For several years  a broad  bipartisan coalition of Senators has advocated for passage of the Agricultural Job Opportunities  Benefits  and Security Act  AgJOBS  and other legislative reforms that would provide our farmers with the long overdue relief they need to maintain a workforce          The AgJOBS bill would not only expand the current H 2A program  it would also modernize and streamline its procedures  making it easier for our farmers to use  AgJOBS would also provide agricultural employers with a stable labor supply by giving many undocumented agricultural workers the chance to earn the right to become legal immigrants           The AgJOBS compromise was reached after years of negotiations  and it represents a unique agreement between farmworker labor unions and agricultural employers  It has the support of a broad coalition of organizations  including major business trade associations  Latino community leaders  civil rights organizations  and religious groups          Moreover AgJOBS will promote our security by helping our government identify persons inside the U S  who are here without authorization  By encouraging farm workers to come out of the shadows  we can stand by family farms while refocusing our limited resources on real threats to our security          I applaud the leadership of Senators Craig  Kennedy  Feinstein  and Boxer on this issue  I support the Craig and Feinstein amendments to this bill because we share a belief that we can tackle this crisis           We are in this chamber debating amendments that will serve our farm economy  and serve to make our immigration system fairer and more workable  What I hope is that we can put politics aside and have a vote  up or down  yes or no  We owe it to our farmers  workers  and consumers to pass a bill that will help save our farms and agricultural industry
