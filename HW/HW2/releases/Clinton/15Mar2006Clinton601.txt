March 15  2006 Statement by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Patty Murray on Expected Nomination of Andrew Von Eschenbach as FDA Commissioner                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC     The American people deserve an FDA that sets the gold standard in drug approval   The FDA under this Administration has squandered that trust and the over the counter application of Plan B is a case in point   For more than two years  the FDA has dragged its feet on making a decision  putting ideology over science   It is past time for the FDA to stop dragging its heels and make a decision on Plan B   We will place a hold on the nomination of Dr  von Eschenbach until the FDA issues a decision on Plan B  yes or no
