April 9  2007 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Speaker Pelosi s Trip to Syria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Interviewer  Nancy Pelosi has taken that trip to Syria which raised a lot of controversy  What was your take on that  Were you pleased that she did that or do you think that was a mistake       Senator Clinton  No I think that both her delegation  which was primarily Democrats  and a Republican delegation that was there approximately at the same time are doing the right thing  We have got to engage these countries  Obviously we have serious differences with a country like Syria  but we re sure not making progress towards our goals in the region by isolating and ignoring them  So I wish the President were engaged in the region  in the way that I would think a President should be  You know we were always engaged  whether it was a Republican or Democratic President  With the former Soviet Union  we had a Communist Empire with thousands of missiles pointed at us  with Presidents who said that they wanted to bury us  running proxy wars against us  We never stopped engaging and talking and we never gave up on our values  In fact I think we learned a lot about our adversaries which helped us eventually bring about their decline and defeat in the Cold War  Well I think that s the much smarter way   I don t agree with the President s view that we don t talk to bad people because clearly that s not a smart way to figure out how you can bring leverage on them and that s what I m interested in          Excerpt of radio interview with WSYR
