March 16  2005 Senator Clinton Vows to Continue Fight to Save Amtrak                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senator says President s Budget cuts would destroy Amtrak                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    Following the Senate Republicans  rejection of an amendment to provide  1 4 billion in funding to help save Amtrak from bankruptcy and shut down  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today vowed to continue fighting to save the nation s rail system and called upon state and local officials to join in keeping the White House from destroying Amtrak  The Byrd Clinton Amendment sought to prevent millions of New Yorkers and Americans from being stranded without a national rail service  The President s current budget completely eliminates federal funding for Amtrak         I am extremely disappointed and outraged by the vote today  The Republican leadership and the Administration seem determined to bring our nation s rail service to a standstill   Senator Clinton said   No country in the world has ever developed and maintained a successful passenger railroad system without assistance from their national government  We will continue to fight for Amtrak s financial solvency  because without this funding  Amtrak s trains will stop         Senator Clinton joined a bi partisan group of Senate colleagues and a broad coalition of business and labor organizations  local officials and the environmental community  at a press conference at Union Station in Washington  DC  yesterday  calling on Congress and President Bush to restore Amtrak s funding         The future for New York without Amtrak would be devastating   Senator Clinton said   Amtrak is an essential component of our transportation network that provides irreplaceable capacity and mobility to New York and the nation          The President s proposal would leave millions of New Yorkers and Americans standing on empty station platforms   Senator Clinton said   If it were up to this President  Amtrak would change its motto from  All Aboard  to  Everyone Off          New Yorkers rely on rail more than perhaps any other state in the nation  Penn Station on 34th Street in Manhattan is the busiest passenger rail station in the United States   almost 9 million passengers boarded Amtrak trains there in 2004  Albany Rensselaer station is the 10th busiest in the country  and much of the upstate economy depends on access to Amtrak through Buffalo  Rochester  and Syracuse        New York also contains the busiest commuter rail system in the country  Much of this system would be forced to shut down if Amtrak received no funding  The effect of the Administration s elimination of Amtrak would mean the paralysis of Metro North  the Long Island Rail Road and New Jersey Transit         An Amtrak shutdown would also drive New York highways and airports into chaos  Amtrak accounts for 50  of the Washington  DC to New York travel market and 35  of the Boston to New York travel market  These passengers would have to seek alternate routes on highways and at airports that are already overcrowded  The result would severely hurt the Northeast region s economy  and it would potentially cripple our entire regional transportation system        President Bush proposed zero dollars for Amtrak s operating subsidy in his 2005 budget  The President s budget claims to provide only enough funding to allow for continued operation of the commuter railroads that depend upon Amtrak in the event of an Amtrak shutdown  A shutdown is the only plausible scenario if no funding is provided  according to Amtrak CEO David Gunn         Amtrak has been attempting to bring its infrastructure up to a state of good repair under leadership of David Gunn  who successfully turned around the New York City subway system through a similar strategy  Amtrak owns the Northeast Corridor  which has never been adequately funded or maintained since the federal government was forced to take it over from the failing private railroads more than 30 years ago        Last year  Senator Clinton supported  1 8 billion for Amtrak operations and Congress provided just over  1 2 billion for operational and capital costs  Amtrak s five year Strategic Plan  which was approved by Amtrak s Board of Directors on June 10  2004  specifies that approximately  1 8 billion would be required for fiscal year 2006
