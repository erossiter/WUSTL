December 11  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on New Department of Labor Reporting Requirements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today issued the following statement following reports that the Bush administration is moving forward with plans to impose costly and unjustified new reporting requirements on unions and union members      Once again  President Bush is using the Department of Labor as a weapon to undermine the labor movement   Under the new rules  tens of thousands of union members will be forced  without justification  to navigate a bureaucratic maze of financial disclosure forms and meet onerous reporting requirements about information as private as their personal mortgages and loans   The information will then be publicly released on the internet   The Bush Administrations goal is harassment  plain and simple   We have a duty to hold President Bush accountable for this ideological abuse of power and to restore a Department of Labor that is actually pro labor    The new requirements will significantly expand the number of individuals who must file reports with the federal government and the amount of information they will be required to submit   Among the new rules is one that would require tens of thousands of union members and their families to research whether the banks that hold their mortgages and loans do business with their union or a company represented by the union   These members would then be required to submit personal financial information about the mortgages and loans to the Department of Labor  which would post that information on a public web site   The Center for American Progress issued a report this week that describes the administrations efforts to use the Office of Labor Management Standards in the Department of Labor to undermine unions for political purposes  most recently through the new reporting rules
