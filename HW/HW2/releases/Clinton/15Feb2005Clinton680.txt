February 15  2005 Statement of Senator Clinton on Her Vote on the Nomination of Michael Chertoff to be Secretary of Homeland Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              There is no position in government of greater importance to the security of our country and of my home state of New York than that of the Secretary of Homeland Security  It has been said before  but it bears repeating    our Nation faces a new kind of challenge to our way of life  I have no doubt we will overcome this challenge  but we will do so only by maintaining and strengthening our civil society and our commitment to being a force for decency and respect for law in the world  After rigorous review of Judge Chertoff s testimony and my personal discussion with him  I have come to the conclusion that Judge Chertoff is professionally qualified to be Secretary of Homeland Security and that he understands and respects the values that the Secretary works to defend         Judge Chertoff s stated commitment to threat and vulnerability based funding and his repeated expressions of support for policies that are essential to the security of New Yorkers are decisive factors in my decision to vote for his confirmation  And we will need Judge Chertoff s support more than ever as Congress deals with the President s FY 2006 budget  I have repeatedly called upon the Administration to implement threat based homeland security funding so that resources go to the states and areas where they are needed most  On the first day of this Congress  I introduced the Domestic Defense Fund Act of 2005 providing  7 billion annually to local communities  states and first responders to be allocated using threat  risk  and vulnerability based criteria  While Judge Chertoff has expressed support for threat  and vulnerability based funding  we will need his help convincing the Bush Administration to follow through on his support         The FY 2006 budget also seeks to cut or eliminate a number of essential first responder programs and proposes no funding for the SAFER Act  There was no funding for the COPS hiring program  the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program  or the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program    named after a NYPD officer killed in the line of duty    that has provided states and local governments with funds to reduce crime and increase public safety  This is a shameful reduction  especially as our fire fighters  police  emergency service workers and other first responders continue to be on the front lines of our nation s homeland defense  The President  s budget also failed to provide funding for the 2 000 new border patrol agents  many of whom will be dedicated specifically to our Northern Border  Judge Chertoff must be willing to fight hard for full funding of these and other programs essential to the keeping our communities safe from crime while also buttressing our homeland defense         Finally  I was pleased to learn that Judge Chertoff testified that his personal experiences have given him a thorough appreciation and respect for state and local perspectives  I agree wholeheartedly that we need to work in partnership with state and local governments  When it comes to securing the homeland  states and local communities must be full partners        I remain deeply concerned about the misguided and potentially unconstitutional policies that have been drafted by the Justice Department and implemented by the Administration in its prosecution of the war on terror and in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq  And I am grateful that the Senate devoted time to a thorough discussion of these important issues  However  these concerns have nothing to do with Judge Chertoff s personal abilities and commitment to public service  and Judge Chertoff has expressed his personal disagreement with many of these policies  Ultimately  his roots in the New Jersey New York region  his personal experiences  and his expressions of commitment to the rule of law and programs and policies that will help protect New York and our nation have secured my vote in favor of confirmation  I call upon Judge Chertoff to work with Congress to ensure that the Administration is vigilant in its efforts to protect our liberty and keep our nation secure         Finally  I encourage Judge Chertoff to meet with New York s 9 11 families as soon as possible after he is confirmed  These men  women and children  who have lost so much  are in need of continuing help and also are a source of great expertise and wisdom  They are the true champions for securing our homeland  and I think the Department could gain a lot by listening to them
