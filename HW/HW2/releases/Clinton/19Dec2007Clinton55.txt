that Central New York continues to lure new businesses and tourists to the region  while ensuring families have the first class services they need    The funds included in this bill are a wise investment in Central New York  and will touch the lives of many New Yorkers  These projects will help to improve our schools  hospitals  and communities  and will strengthen New Yorks economy and infrastructure  said Senator Clinton  I am especially pleased that funding for interoperable communications in Onondaga County was included in this bill  It will be used for critical upgrades that are essential for the safety and effectiveness of Central New York law enforcement and first responders  I also welcome support for the Auburn Regional Bioenergy Enterprise  which will further cement Central New Yorks reputation as a center for alternative energy  and funding for the Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome  which is vitally important to our national security    Onondaga County will use the federal funds to improve the Interoperable Communications System for first responders in Syracuse and the surrounding areas  Funds will be used to replace incompatible 800MHz radio equipment to the proposed City County UHF Trunked Land Mobile Radio Interoperable Communication System  Infrastructure equipment currently used to support two way radio communications will not be consistent with equipment planned for the new first responder system that supports operations in the City of Syracuse and County of Onondaga  Onondaga County is in the process of building and planning to implement a trunked radio UHF Land Mobile Radio System  This system when implemented will embrace all first responders in the City of Syracuse and County of Onondaga  This project will consolidate all voice communications into one operational system    The Northeast Air Defense Sector  NEADS  requires a new Support facility to replace aging facilities  which are currently not co located  and to improve force protection of assigned resources  This is a two phase construction project with Phase I having been approved and supported with  3 million in FY 2006 military construction funding  The NEADS is located on the former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome  Unit personnel are housed in three different locations  Relocating the Headquarters building inside the Sector Operations Control Center  SOCC  Compound and moving personnel from Depot 1 to this building will improve protection of NEADS personnel and facilities    The Auburn Regional Bioenergy Enterprise will use federal funds to develop a new power source for the city of Auburns Waste Water Treatment Plant  The Engineering Feasibility study recommended that the city transition from sludge incineration which is Natural Gas dependent to a methane digester utilizing the technology of Europe to dispose of the wastewater treatment plant sludge  utilize existing landfill methane gas and converting this into electricity to operate the citys wastewater treatment plant saving approximately  1 5 M operating costs per year and provide economic development power to industrial users at Technology Park    The omnibus bill includes federal funds for the Revitalization and Redevelopment project of the Hamlet of Brewerton in the Town of Cicero   These funds will be the impetus for taking the long neglected area of the Brewerton waterfront and changing it to a thriving and bustling area   By doing so  significant new jobs would be created  property values would be greatly increased  and people in the northern suburbs of Onondaga County and southern suburbs of Oswego County would be able to enjoy a vibrant waterfront community    Federal funds were also approved for the United Auto Workers Region 9 Training Initiative   This initiative will fund New Process Gears Competitive Employment Training Assistance program  which will train and educate existing employees in technologies to support the recently
