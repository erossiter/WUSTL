March 23  2005 Clinton Urges Bush Administration to  Reconsider Attempt to Undermine Title IX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  is urging the Bush administration to reconsider new rules that would weaken the requirement that schools provide equal opportunities for girls and young women in sports  Senator Clinton has sent the following letter to United States Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings urging her to uphold the Title IX law         March 22  2005       Dear Secretary Spellings        I write to express my deep concerns with the Department of Education s new Title IX policy guidance  This guidance  which was issued late in the day last Friday  appears to be nothing short of an under the radar effort to reduce athletic opportunities for women and girls  and to undermine their right to equal treatment         Since Title IX became law in 1972  participation by girls in high school sports has increased by 800 percent  participation by young women in college athletics has increased by 400 percent  Quite simply  Title IX works    it has provided interested girls and women many more opportunities to participate in athletics  In the face of this unqualified success  I am deeply concerned that we will see all of this progress begin to erode if the guidance issued Friday is permitted to stand        The Department s guidance would make it possible for a school to use an  interest survey  to determine whether they are Title IX compliant  This provision would dramatically diminish the requirement that schools provide equal opportunities for girls and women  The interest survey approach is problematic for several reasons         First  under the Department s guidance  a lack of response to the survey may be interpreted as lack of interest in sports participation  Given the low rate of responses to surveys in general  particularly to email surveys  participation will probably be a poor indicator of student interest in sports  Furthermore  surveys alone cannot accurately measure student interest and ability  Plenty of students do not recognize their own potential until a coach  parent  or friend encourages them to try  It is quite likely that women and girls will not express interest and ability in particular sports if they have not been offered the chance to play them        Currently  schools have to take other factors into consideration  such as the opinions of coaches and administrators  or participation rates in sports in surrounding high schools or recreational leagues  These methods are more accurate measures of the demand for sports among girls and women         Finally  interest surveys are likely to reflect and reinforce existing discrimination against women and girls  who have not received and still do not receive equal sports opportunities  Today  30 years after Title IX became law  women and girls receive only 41 percent of athletic opportunities despite the fact that they constitute half of student enrollments         As I said in my speech on the Senate floor on February 26  2003   to use interest surveys to determine the proportion of girls and women who must be provided the opportunity to participate in sports    is equivalent to surveying women in 1900 to ask whether they would like to vote and then using the results to justify their disenfranchisement   Julie Foudy  the world class soccer player  has described the effect of using interest surveys as  freezing discrimination in place         The bottom line is that the Department s guidance would give schools an easy way out of their Title IX responsibilities  I was encouraged when you reaffirmed the Department s commitment to Title IX in response to my questioning during your confirmation hearing  Today  I am deeply disappointed with your willingness to undermine Title IX s effectiveness        As a result of the Department s guidance  how many millions of girls will miss out on the exhilaration of winning  the life lessons of losing with dignity  the discipline instilled by rigorous training  and the confidence that can be gained from being a respected teammate  The value of these experiences cannot be quantified  and they last a lifetime  In the interests of today s young women and girls  and those who will follow  I ask you to reconsider Friday s guidance         Thank you for your consideration        Sincerely        Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton
