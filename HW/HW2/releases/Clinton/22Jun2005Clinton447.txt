

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today urged the Secretary of Agriculture to have the Agricultural Marketing Service  AMS  work with the grape industry to carry out a bonus purchase of Concord grape juice this year          The Concord grape industry is vitally important to New York State  and it is essential that AMS work with them to ensure the bonus purchase of juice     Schumer said     While we have been working on long term solutions for this problem  something needs to happen now before the harvest to help this industry             New York  s grape growers need our help and they need it fast  Facing excess stock of a very precious but perishable commodity  it is essential that we act immediately to assist them in this way     Senator Clinton said    We appreciate the assistance that the AMS has provided in the past by conducting similar bonus buys  We hope that they will again see the very real needs of our grape growers and approve this purchase           Carryover stocks of Concord juice are growing  in part due to increased competition from imported grape juice concentrate   Concord grape growers in New York were recently awarded Trade Adjustment Assistance to help them adjust over the long term to the changing market situation   In the near term  the large carryover stocks continue to hurt the market   In a personal letter to Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns  Schumer and Clinton asked that AMS work with the grape industry to reduce the Concord juice carryover through a bonus purchase of juice        Schumer and Clinton wrote    Similar bonus buys by AMS in FY 2000 and earlier effectively stabilized the Concord grape markets   Time is of the essence   the carryover needs to be reduced as much as possible before August since the 2005 Concord crop will be harvested in September and October           The National Grape Cooperative Association  which owns Welch  s  is the world  s leading producer of Concord grape juice and spreads   Approximately 400 National members cultivate over 12 500 acres in New York State   The grape industry contributed over 39 million dollars in cash receipts to the economy of New York State in 2003   The bonus buy will help Concord growers in New York  and also thousands of growers in Pennsylvania  Ohio  Arkansas  Missouri  Indiana  Michigan and Washington           A copy of the Senators   letter is attached        June 22  2005       The Honorable Mike Johanns   Secretary of Agriculture  U S  Department of Agriculture   1400 Independence
