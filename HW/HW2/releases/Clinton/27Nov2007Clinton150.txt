                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Senator Urges President to Clarify Declaration of Principles with the Iraqi Government                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on President Bush today to clarify the recently signed Declaration of Principles for a Long Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of America to confirm that the United States does not plan to place any permanent bases within Iraq and instead plans to begin the phased redeployment of U S  troops  In a letter to the President  Senator Clinton expressed great concern that the Declaration of Principles did not explicitly indicate that the United States will not seek and will not maintain permanent military bases in Iraq  despite the clear will of Congress and the American people    The President must make it crystal clear that the United States will not maintain permanent bases in Iraq  Senator Clinton said  They would damage U S  interests in Iraq and the broader region  and I will continue to strongly oppose them    The full text of Senator Clintons letter follows     November 27  2007    The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    I write with great concern over the text of the Declaration of Principles for a Long Term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship Between the Republic of Iraq and the United States of America that the White House released yesterday   I am particularly concerned that this document did not contain any explicit reference or language that indicates that the United States will not seek and will not maintain permanent military bases in Iraq   Moreover  the document s failure to note any intent to begin the withdrawal of U S  troops from Iraq is a missed opportunity to pressure Iraq s leaders to make the compromises necessary to achieve political reconciliation in Iraq    As you know  in 2006  Congress explicitly passed a restriction on the use of any funds to establish any military installation or base for the permanent stationing of United States Forces in Iraq   However  the Declaration of Principles that you signed with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki does not explicitly rule out permanent U S  bases in Iraq   Rather  the Declaration instead calls for agreements between the two governments with respect to the political  cultural  economic  and security spheres to be achieved by July 2008   Indeed  press reports indicate that Lieutenant General Douglas Lute  your coordinator for Iraq policy  stated  It s too soon to tell what shape and size the future U S  military relationship with Iraq would take   Given the express will of Congress and the American people to oppose permanent U S  military bases in Iraq  the failure to include express language addressing this issue in the Declaration of Principles with the Iraqi government is deeply troubling   To be clear  attempts to establish permanent bases in Iraq would damage U S  interests in Iraq and the broader region  and I will continue to strongly oppose such efforts      Furthermore  the Declaration of Principles does not reference any agreement to reduce the number of U S  troops in Iraq   When you first announced the escalation of U S  troops earlier this year  the ostensible purpose was to provide the Iraqis with the breathing space to achieve political reconciliation   By any meaningful measurement  that political reconciliation has not yet occurred   The absence of any reference to a redeployment of U S  troops from Iraq in the Declaration of Principles is a missed opportunity to put pressure on the Iraqis to engage in the compromises necessary for political reconciliation    I urge you to clarify the Declaration of Principles with the Iraqi government to confirm that the United States does not plan to place any permanent bases within Iraq and instead plans to begin the phased redeployment of U S  troops   Such a clarification would make clear to the citizens of both nations that the U S  military presence in Iraq is temporary and encourage Iraqi political leaders to make greater efforts towards political reconciliation     Thank you for your consideration   Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton   cc   The
