September 21  2005 Senators Voinovich  Clinton Introduce First Responders Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    Senators George Voinovich  OH  and Senator Hillary Clinton  NY   along with Representative Carolyn B  Maloney  NY  and U S  Representative Christopher Shays  CT  today introduced legislation that would provide free medical screenings to first responders  volunteers  and emergency personnel who respond to national disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001          Through my own discussions with Ohio emergency personnel who responded to 9 11  I know that many of the Ground Zero first responders have experienced a variety of health problems  including respiratory illnesses  pneumonia and asthma   After 9 11  approximately 40 000 personnel  mostly first responders  answered the call   Many continue to face the possibility of long term health issues     said Voinovich     Now with nearly 86 000 federal  state  and local personnel and first responders in the Gulf Coast responding to Hurricane Katrina  it  s vital that we get this legislation passed   Although the health effects of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina are still unknown  preparation is our best defense   If a horrific event occurs  those who risk their lives to respond must know that their health needs will be taken care of   This legislation will send a message to our first responders that America cares about its heroes             When disaster strikes  addressing public health   and the health of our courageous first responders    should be at the very top of our priority list     Senator Clinton said    We have a moral obligation to track the health of first responders    immediately and over time    and provide them with information and assistance in receiving treatment so they can maintain  or regain  their good health           There are nearly 86 000 response  rescue  recovery and law enforcement personnel currently working around the clock to bring critical aid and support to the Gulf Coast region   On September 17  2005  the Joint Taskforce Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   U S  Environmental Protection Agency released the   Environmental Health Needs and Habitability Assessment      This report identified 13 environmental health issues  including drinking water  wastewater  solid waste and debris  and sediments and soil contamination from toxic chemicals   One of the report  s main recommendations is to   maintain a central focus on public safety and recovery worker health and safety throughout the rebuilding of New Orleans      Last week  EPA released preliminary results of initial sediment sampling from New Orleans and recommended avoiding all contact with the sediment  where possible  due to the presence of E  coli and fuel oils        The Disaster Area Health and Environmental Monitoring Act of 2005 helps make permanent similar protections authorizing the President to carry out a program for the protection  assessment  monitoring  and study of the health and safety of emergency personnel  volunteers and workers who respond to a disaster and assist in the cleanup  if the President declares that a dangerous substance is being released   The program involves informing and protecting responders against possible health impacts  monitoring them over the short and long term  providing medical referrals  and ensuring that any information is used to prevent or protect against future incidents        The bill also provides for a two year reauthorization of the Pre Disaster Mitigation program  which is set to expire on September 30  2007   The program provides technical and financial assistance to states and local governments for projects to reduce the impact of a potential disaster  such as raising a building to make it resistant to flood damage   This assistance has been effective in saving lives  reducing disaster costs  and protecting property since 2000 when the program was initially authorized
