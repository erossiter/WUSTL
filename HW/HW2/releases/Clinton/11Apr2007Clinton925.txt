April 11  2007 Senators Bayh and Clinton Introduce Legislation to Provide Better Care for Soldiers with Traumatic Brain Injury                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC   U S  Senators Evan Bayh and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced legislation that would offer immediate help for severely wounded soldiers suffering from Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   by extending their active duty status so they can continue receiving care through the Department of Defense and specialized private care centers while the VA develops the capacity to meet their unique care needs   While TBI has been identified as the  signature injury  afflicting our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan  bureaucratic red tape and a system designed to handle body trauma and aging veterans has made it difficult for these soldiers to obtain care            Administrative and medical shortcomings have prevented many of our heroes from receiving the care they desperately need and deserve   Senator Bayh said    This legislation would provide an immediate solution for the hundreds of soldiers suffering from Traumatic Brain Injury  which is especially critical when time plays such an important role in recovery   No soldier should have to fight for quality care  and I am proud to work with Senator Clinton  MOAA and the Wounded Warrior Project to offer a way to help them  regardless of their military status             When you serve your country  your country should serve you  And when a service member is severely injured  that soldier  Marine  airman  sailor  Reservist  or Guard member deserves the very best health care and treatment a grateful nation can provide  That is the promise this bill will help keep for wounded warriors with traumatic brain injuries and their families   said Senator Clinton          The legislation would provide a one year medical extension to allow soldiers suffering from TBI to retain active duty status  which provides them access to cognitive therapy in private rehabilitation hospitals and facilities   Most problems with care have occurred when soldiers suffering from TBI have been transferred from active duty status to retired  where they can no longer access private care centers and must receive treatment through the VA  which lacks the capability to treat TBI patients            In addition  the legislation would appoint a Department of Defense medical advocate for all TBI patients  to help them navigate the red tape and bureaucracy that often surrounds treatment   Finally  the legislation would require an annual report beginning in two years to ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs is making improvements in its abilities to treat TBI victims  to bridge the gap between the treatment received by active duty and retired troops          Senators Bayh and Clinton were joined on the call by representatives of the Wounded Warrior Project and Military Officers Association of America  which participated in the drafting of this legislation            This initiative is an immediate priority for our severely injured TBI patients and their families    The Wounded Warrior Project is pleased that Senators Bayh and Clinton have listened to the concerns of our injured servicemembers and looks forward to working with them to give these families more time to understand their options and adapt to their difficult situations   said Meredith Beck  National Policy Director for the Wounded Warrior Project           This proposed legislation provides an important interim option for servicemembers who have suffered severe traumatic brain injuries and their families  a critical option while DoD and the VA continue to work together toward seamless transition for the severely wounded   By staying under the DoD umbrella these victims are afforded a health care continuum assurance that currently is not guaranteed once released from active duty   said Ana Smythe  Col USMC Ret  Deputy Director  Government Relations MOAA          As members of the Armed Services Committee  Senator Bayh and Senator Clinton also announced plans to attend a hearing Thursday to question military leaders  including Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England  on what measures the Department of Defense is undertaking to remove the barriers for soldiers to receive treatment                Listen to audio of Senators Bayh and Clinton          Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning veterans
