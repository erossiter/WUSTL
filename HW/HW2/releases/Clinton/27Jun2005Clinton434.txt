June 27  2005 Statement by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  and Gordon Smith on National HIV Testing Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC     As we mark National HIV Testing Day  it is critical to underscore the importance of testing to ensuring early treatment of HIV before it progresses into AIDS  We have introduced legislation  the Early Treatment for HIV Act  which would increase access to treatment for Medicaid recipients diagnosed with HIV  But a critical step must be increasing awareness about the need to be tested in the first place        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  estimates that there are more than one million people living with HIV in the United States  over 100 000 of which live in New York and Oregon alone  Alarmingly  an estimated 25 percent of those with HIV have not been tested and do not know they are HIV positive  delaying treatment and putting them at risk for unknowingly passing on the virus to others         It is estimated that people living with HIV remain symptom free for about 10 years  Too many people only learn they have the virus after it has progressed to the point where they develop symptoms  In the most recent CDC study available  38 percent of people diagnosed with HIV were diagnosed with AIDS within one year  This means that too many people are missing the chance for early treatment that would help them live longer and reduce the need for more expensive care and costly hospital stays  Pricewaterhouse Coopers has estimated that expanding early treatment to Medicaid recipients alone would save approximately  1 5 billion over 10 years        It s simple    early testing saves lives and reduces health care costs  We must all work together to raise awareness not just on National HIV Testing Day  but every day
