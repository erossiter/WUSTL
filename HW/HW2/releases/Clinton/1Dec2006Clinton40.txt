December 1  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on World AIDS Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today marked World AIDS Day with the following statement  This year  the theme of World AIDS Day is   Stop AIDS  Keep the Promise     Communities around the world will be commemorating the day by asking governments to redouble their efforts to meet the prevention  treatment and funding goals established by the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV AIDS in June 2001             For twenty five years  we have worked to combat HIV and AIDS  an epidemic that requires our smartest and best strategies at all levels of government  both in the United States and around the world  In that time  we have made much progress  People with HIV and AIDS are living longer  healthier lives  thanks to the development of life extending medications  Our prevention efforts have a positive impact  In the United States  we have seen marked decreases in mother to child transmission over the past decade  and in several of the hardest hit countries in Africa  UNAIDS reports declines in HIV infection rates among youth  Yet the sheer magnitude of this epidemic continues to outpace our efforts to combat it  Another 4 3 million individuals worldwide were infected with HIV in 2006  In the United States  more than one million individuals are living with HIV and AIDS  and the CDC reports that approximately one quarter of these individuals do not know their HIV status           We must continue to provide resources to combat the global AIDS epidemic  I support efforts to increase our contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria  which reaches millions of individuals in countries around the globe  and is an essential tool in our global response to these three diseases  Worldwide  infections among women continue to increase  According to UNAIDS  women account for the majority of those living with HIV and AIDS in sub Saharan Africa  Throughout their lifespan  women need to be able to access the essential health care services  including reproductive health services  that will allow them to protect themselves  We also need to focus on the intersection between other risks for women    such as gender based violence    and increased risk for HIV           In the United States  we must continue to fulfill the promise of care and treatment for those living with AIDS  As a Senator from New York  the state that has experienced the heaviest burden of the AIDS epidemic  I understand the importance of the Ryan White CARE Act in helping to provide essential care and treatment services  Because I have seen the benefits of these programs across our state   from Long Island and New York City to Buffalo and Rochester   I am committed to ensuring that the pending reauthorization of this bill strengthens and improves the ability of New Yorkers and all Americans to access HIV and AIDS care  support and treatment services  A reauthorization that destabilizes our systems of care and devastates and potentially destroys the ability of our communities to address need is unacceptable  We should be working to strengthen the CARE Act for everyone  not decimate it           Our government should commemorate this day by renewing support for efforts to end the AIDS epidemic around the world  and by ensuring that we do not see devastating cutbacks to services here at home  We must make good on our promises  and increase support for programs that help people affected by AIDS  Millions of people around the world are already living with HIV  and we must do everything in our power to keep millions more from dying
