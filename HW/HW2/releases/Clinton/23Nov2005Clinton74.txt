November 23  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Friday  November 25  is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women  As so many of us spend this day after Thanksgiving with our families  we should remember the millions of women both in the United States and around the world for whom the home is not a safe haven      Violence against women is tolerated in far too many places around the globe  The United Nations Development Fund for Women reports that nearly one in four women worldwide may experience sexual violence from partners in their lifetimes  Half of female homicide deaths are at the hands of current or former partners  It is time for all of us to say that we will not accept violence against women    not a minute more      I am particularly concerned about the linkages between gender based violence and trafficking in women and girls  Although reliable statistics are difficult to find  we know that 800 000 individuals are trafficked from country to country every year  and 80  of these are women and girls  Almost 15 000 individuals are trafficked to the United States each year      If women and girls are treated as chattel  as property to be sold to the highest bidder  they are more likely to be relegated to second tier status  and be abused or shipped across borders without their consent  We need to promote women  s rights as human rights  and allow women to become full and equal participants in society  In order to protect women around the world from the scourge of trafficking  I am committed to working with my colleagues in the Senate to reauthorize legislation that has increased the ability of our government to prosecute traffickers and prevent the spread of this heinous crime      In America too  violence against women is tragically common   One in three American girls will experience a physical assault by a partner at some point in their lives   In the Senate this fall  I co sponsored legislation renewing the Violence Against Women Act   Between 1994 and 2000  Congress distributed over  3 8 billion through this bill to states and local communities  contributing to almost a 50  drop in domestic violence   I worked to ensure that the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act would stiffen criminal penalties for repeat federal domestic violence offenders  incorporate prevention strategies  strengthen rape crisis centers  and improve collaboration between law enforcement  the courts  and public and private services providers to victims of domestic violence      In 1999  the United Nations designated November 25 as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women  Throughout the world  governments  communities  and families will be calling for an end to gender based violence  and remembering those who have been victims of such violence
