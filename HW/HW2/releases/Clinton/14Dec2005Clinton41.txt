December 14  2005 Senator Clinton Says Republican Budget Plan Fails to Keep Faith With the Priorities of the American People                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    In a speech on the Senate floor today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton took aim at the budget plan being debated by the Senate calling it   a fatally flawed plan that finances further irresponsible tax breaks on the backs of Americans who struggle to pay college tuition  provide health care coverage for their families and keep their homes warm this winter               This budget plan has been written in the full spirit of the   Grinch Who Stole Christmas     But instead of taking away the presents  the decorations and other vestiges of Christmas like the Grinch did  the Republican majority in Congress is instead ringing in the holiday season by taking away Medicaid benefits  food stamps  child support enforcement  child care programs and student loan benefits      Senator Clinton told her colleagues     But one of the big differences is that at the end of the story the Grinch sees the errors of his ways and had a change of heart  I can only hope that the members of this chamber experience a similar revelation              In detailing the devastating budget cuts  Senator Clinton noted the irony of the majority  s willingness to finance corporate tax breaks while taking a budget axe to programs critical to working families             Consider this  the  2 6 billion in new tax breaks for oil companies contained in the Energy Bill  one in a series of irresponsible corporate tax giveaways  would cover the health care costs of an additional 1 7 million kids nationwide     Senator Clinton said     The Republican majority is also proposing an approximately  700 million cut in food stamps   Simply reinstating the superfund polluter tax  which forces companies that pollute to bear the expense of clean up instead of average taxpayers  would alone generate  7 3 billion over the next ten years    more than ten times the cost of the food stamp cut               And if we simply took the  18 billion revenue raising package adopted by the Senate in its tax bill    which repeals  among other loopholes  another  4 3 billion tax giveaway to oil companies and cracks down on abusive corporate tax transactions  such as setting up offshore in tax havens like Bermuda to avoid paying U S  taxes    we would be able to avoid the painful increases in costs to students striving to better themselves through a college education     Clinton added    Instead  we are looking at the largest cut to aid in the history of the student loan program   An average student saddled with  17 500 in student loans would pay up to  5 800 in additional payments under the Republican plan   Approximately 472 000 New York students would see an increase in costs             Clinton concluded by stating    What the Republican majority has proposed is not what is best for America  because it undermines our long held tradition of supporting families by providing the tools they need to make American the best it can be   The economic policies of the majority and this Administration defy both arithmetic and reality   It  s time that we go back to a conservative fiscal policy that pays as you go  doesn  t spend what you don  t have  and produces balanced budgets and surpluses that will enable us to prepare for the future  And it  s time that we return to policies that truly value all American families
