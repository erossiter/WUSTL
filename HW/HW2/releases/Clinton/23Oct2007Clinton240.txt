October 23  2007 Senator Clinton Urges Closing Loophole in Dairy Promotion Checkoff Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Loophole Disadvantages U S  Dairy Producers While Dairy Importers Get A Free Ride                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined several of her senate colleagues in calling for action on a fundamental issue of fairness concerning imports under the dairy promotion checkoff program  In a letter  the lawmakers urged Senator Tom Harkin  Chairman of the Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee  and Ranking Member Senator Saxby Chambliss  to use the upcoming Farm Bill to close a loophole that allows dairy importers to share the benefits of dairy product promotion but pay none of the costs     This is an issue of fairness and one that needs to be addressed so we can level the playing field for our nations dairy farmers  said Senator Clinton  Importers are enjoying the benefits of this growing market  but not pitching in a penny to help  I urge my colleagues to fix this loophole in the upcoming farm bill so that the dairy promotion assessment is applied to diary importers  and not just to our domestic producers     Worldwide diary imports have made significant gains in the U S  market  increasing in value from  830 3 million to  2 335 billion from 1989 to 2006  Every year U S  dairy farmers contribute  270 million to promote dairy products  while importers share the benefit of this growing market for dairy products  but pay none of the promotion costs  In the 2002 Farm Bill  Congress required the dairy promotion checkoff program to be applied to imported dairy products   However  because of technical objections to the structure of the program  this provision was not implemented    The technical fix would extend the dairy promotion checkoff to the small fraction of U S  producers not currently covered  which represent only 0 44  of U S  milk production in 2006  Once this technical adjustment to the program is made  the U S  can level the playing field for the vast majority of dairy farmers and begin applying the assessment to imported dairy products  as Congress sought to do five years ago       The letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member follows      October 22  2007 Senator Tom Harkin  Chairman  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  United States Senate   328A Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510 6000   Senator Saxby Chambliss  Ranking Member  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry   United States Senate  328A Russell Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510 6000    Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss    We write to you regarding a fundamental issue of fairness concerning imports under the dairy promotion checkoff program that we urge you to address in the 2007 Farm Bill   Each year  U S  dairy farmers contribute  270 million out of their own pockets to promote dairy products  including dairy ingredients used in other food products   Importers share the benefit of this growing market for dairy products  but pay none of the costs   Dairy farmers across the country have faced this unequal playing field and free loading of imported dairy products long enough and believe that it is high time for Congress to put an end to this unjust situation    In the 2002 Farm Bill  Congress required the dairy promotion checkoff program to be applied to imported dairy products   However  because of technical objections to the structure of the program  this provision was not implemented   The technical fix we are urging be included in the Senate version of the Farm Bill is a provision that was proposed by then Agriculture Secretary Johanns in USDAs farm bill proposal   This correction would extend the dairy promotion checkoff to the small fraction of U S  producers not currently covered  which represent only 0 44  of US milk production in 2006  specifically those in Alaska  Hawaii and Puerto Rico   Once this technical adjustment to the program is made  the U S  can level the playing field for the vast majority of dairy farmers and begin applying the assessment to imported dairy products  as Congress sought to do five years ago        As you are no doubt aware  dairy imports are a significant and growing share of the U S  marketplace   From 1989 to 2006  worldwide imports of dairy products into the U S  increased in value from  830 3 million to  2 335 billion    The promotion assessment on imports is important in terms of fairness for U S  producers and the additional contribution it would make to the dairy promotion checkoff program   However  it is truly a modest amount  estimated to be less than  11 million annually  compared to the  2 335 billion importers are selling to U S  consumers    Again  we strongly urge you to include the technical fix to the dairy checkoff program in the 2007 Farm Bill so that importers of dairy products can begin paying their fair share of the cost of encouraging overall demand for dairy products within the U S  market   The thousands of dairy producers operating across our states deserve nothing less    Sincerely
