December 19  2007 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Federal Aviation Administration s Proposals to Reduce Congestion and Delays in New York Airspace                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC  Todays announcement by Secretary Peters is extremely disappointing  but unfortunately not surprising   After months of ignoring this growing problem of congestion and delays in New York s airspace  the FAA has come up with a short sighted plan that has the potential to raise fares on the flying public and not even address the congestion in the airspace   The FAA has their head in the sand by simply ignoring that the number of controllers continues to decline while congestion and delays go up   Instead of adequately staffing our control towers  expediting new technology  and expanding capacity at our airports  the FAA opts for an untested plan that penalizes New Yorkers and the flying public   I will continue to press for needed changes to make our skies safer and reduce frustrating delays for air travelers
