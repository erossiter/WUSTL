December 7  2006 Senator Clinton Questions the Co Chairs of the Iraq Study Group  James Baker and Lee Hamilton  at a Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               SENATOR CLINTON   Thank you very much again  gentlemen  for your service to our country once again  I think you can tell from the tenor and content of the questions that we re searching for the best way to implement a series of policies and actions that might possibly move us forward  As I listen to you and as I reviewed the report  I am basically hearing two overriding suggestions one that we have to engender the will and assist the capacity of the Iraqi government to take the political and economic actions necessary to stabilize itself and our biggest stick in order to do that is to make it clear we are not there unconditionally  we are not going to be babysitting a civil war  we are not going to take sides in sectarian violence  Is that a correct statement number one        CONGRESSMAN HAMILTON  I think it is a correct statement but I do not think it is the only leverage we have   the troop level  I think the conditionality of aid is another leverage  I also think if you play it right the regional diplomacy which Jim has been talking about can be used very effectively as a leverage on the Iraqi government   But you are right   We think you have to encourage the Iraqi government to act and the military troop level is a very  very important part of that        SENATOR CLINTON  But let me follow up and ask about our own government because you have a series of recommendations that are quite           both comprehensive and challenging   The idea of a Goldwater Nichols process that would get us where we need to be  That took decades  We know it was contentious   It made significant changes  we don  t have time for that  You  ve got other recommendations that talk about engaging the entire US government using all the tool at our disposal  We  ve now heard from the Iraq study Group but we need the White House to become the Iraq Results Group  That is very frustrating for some of us  We don  t understand the misjudgments and missteps that have been taken in the last  years   What advice can you give us as to the role the Congress can play to try to help create the conditions that our own government will muster both the will and capacity to act along the lines that you  ve recommended and that I think we in general agree need to be pursued        SECRETARY BAKER  Senator Clinton I think that if the Congress were to   In addition to praising this report  which many members of Congress have  and for which we are grateful  if the Congress  could say   this is a good basis for going forward and unifying the country behind a single approach to this difficult problem of Iraq     that would help  I think  the executive branch in its deliberations  They just got the report yesterday  just like you just got it yesterday  We  ve heard differing views hear with respect to many of the recommendations  If  the Congress could get together behind supporting   let  s say utopianly  all of the recommendations of this report  that would do a lot toward moving things downtown  in my opinion       CONGRESSMAN HAMILTON  The Congress is a co equal branch of government  I frankly am not that impressed with what the Congress has been able to do  I think the Congress has been extraordinarily timid in its exercise of its Constitutional responsibilities on the question of war making and conducting war  Now the answers here are not easy   but in a word  I think  very robust oversight is necessary  I think it has been lacking   I think it has not been a strong performance by the Congress   And what can you do to most ensure success of the policy  I would say very vigorous robust oversight  Many of the problems that you mentioned that have occurred that we did not examine because we thought it was out of our mandate I think could have been corrected with vigorous oversight       SENATOR CLINTON  Thank you          Read Senator Clinton s statement on the Iraq Study Group Report   Read more of Senator Clinton s statements concerning the war in Iraq
