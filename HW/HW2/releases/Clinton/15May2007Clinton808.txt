May 15  2007 Senator Clinton Calls General Motors CEO Following Announcement of Massena Plant Closing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today spoke with General Motors  GM  President and CEO G  Richard Wagoner Jr  to discuss the recent announcement that the plant in Massena will be shut down  The plant closing would result in approximately 500 lost jobs for the local area           I am extremely concerned about this General Motors announcement   Senator Clinton said   This plant has been a vital part of the Massena community for nearly 50 years and has employed hundreds of local residents  This closing would put these dedicated GM employees out of work and would have a profoundly negative impact on the local economy  I made my concerns known directly to CEO Wagoner today when I called him to discuss the situation and I asked him to work with my staff and the local community to ensure that no matter what happens  he will take care of these workers and this community           Yesterday GM announced that the company would be relocating production and jobs out of New York State  The resulting layoffs would begin soon and end in late 2008 affecting an estimated 500 local residents           On Friday  following rumors of the plant s closure  Senator Clinton and Congressman John McHugh sent a letter to General Motors CEO Wagoner urging him not to shutdown the plant and inviting him to communicate with officials about possible ways to keep the plant in Massena  Senator Clinton s office has since been in contact with local  state and community officials to offer her help          A copy of the Congressman McHugh and Senator Clinton s letter is attached            May 11  2007      Mr  G  Richard Wagoner  Jr   Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  General Motors Corporation  100 Renaissance Center  Detroit  MI 48265 0001      Dear Mr  Wagoner       We are writing to express our deep concern with news that General Motors  GM  may close its Powertrain plant in Massena  New York          We have learned that GM may be proceeding with a plan to shutter its Massena operations and transfer their work outside the State of New York  If this information is correct  we would be extremely disappointed as GM apparently did not first attempt to work with the relevant federal  state  and local officials to find a solution to any challenges it faces to maintaining the Massena facility  Therefore  we want to clearly underscore our strong personal commitment to join with local and state officials to mutually explore with you all possible options to continue operations of the Massena plant  We would welcome the opportunity to meet with you at your earliest convenience to discuss a path forward          This GM plant has been an integral part of the Massena community for nearly 50 years  It is our strong belief that Massena has been a very good host to GM  As I am sure you can appreciate  any changes in the status of the Massena plant will have a profoundly negative effect upon the region s economy  Moreover  the devastating impact on the quality of life of 425 loyal and hardworking GM employees cannot be overstated  We strongly encourage GM to work closely with federal  state  and local officials in an effort to avoid an unfortunate decision on a community and workforce whose support and sacrifice over so many years have contributed greatly to the interests of your company          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton  United States Senator      John M  McHugh  Member of Congress
