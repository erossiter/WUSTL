November 9  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Amtrak Board of Directors   Announcement to Terminate Amtrak President                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC    The Amtrak Board of Director  s decision to terminate Amtrak President David Gunn is baffling and questionable   David Gunn has fought tirelessly to restrain spending  improve critical infrastructure  and keep Amtrak  s trains running on time despite the Bush Administration seeking to bankrupt our nation  s passenger rail system   David Gunn came out of retirement to ensure that Amtrak not only survive  but eventually thrive            Congress has repeatedly rejected the Bush Administration  s proposal to bankrupt Amtrak as the alleged   reform    agenda   Congress recently passed the reauthorization of Amtrak which would keep the system in tact while implementing some key reforms   We authorized billions of dollars in grants for necessary infrastructure and capital upgrades  Likewise  the Senate Appropriations Committees provided  1 4 billion for Amtrak  s operating budget this year  which would enable the Northeast Corridor  and all of Amtrak  to make critical repairs and improvements            David Gunn should be commended for working under strenuous conditions   He fought to protect America  s national passenger rail system and for that he deserves our praise   The Board  s actions warrant a closer look at their overall stewardship of Amtrak  New Yorkers rely on rail more than perhaps any other citizens  Penn Station is the busiest passenger rail station in the US    almost 9 million passengers boarded Amtrak trains in 2004   Amtrak  s continued operation is critical to New York
