                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Rumsfeld Testimony Comes After Senator Clinton Called On Him To Appear at Public Hearing Washington  DC    After urging Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to reverse course and testify in public before the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today pressed Secretary Rumsfeld on the Bush Administration  s handling of the war in Iraq   Emphasizing that the collective common sense overwhelmingly does not either understand or approve of the way Secretary Rumsfeld and the Administration are handling Iraq  Senator Clinton underscored the Administration  s numerous errors in judgment  strategic blunders and record of incompetence that have led to the current situation in Iraq   Senator Clinton also indicated that she will submit additional questions for Secretary Rumsfeld to answer on Iraq       Transcript of Senator Clinton  s Interaction with Secretary Rumsfeld   Senator Clinton   Mr  Secretary  we  re glad you  re here   In your opening statement  you referenced the common sense of Americans   Well  I think it  s fair to say that that collective common sense overwhelmingly does not either understand or approve of the way you and the Administration are handling Iraq and Afghanistan   Under your leadership there have been numerous errors in judgment that have led us to where we are in Iraq and Afghanistan   We have a full fledged insurgency and full blown sectarian conflict in Iraq   Now  whether you label it a civil war or not  it certainly has created a situation of extreme violence and the continuing loss of life among our troops and of the Iraqis   You did not go into Iraq with enough troops to establish law and order   You disbanded the entire Iraqi army  now we  re trying to recreate it   You did not do enough planning for what is called Phase IV and rejected all the planning that had been done previously to maintain stability after the regime was overthrown   You underestimated the nature and strength of the insurgency  the sectarian violence  and the spread of Iranian influence            Last year  Congress passed the United States Policy in Iraq Act  which I strong supported   This law declares 2006 to be a year of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty  with Iraqi security forces taking the lead  for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq  thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of US forces from Iraq   However  we appear to be moving in the opposite direction   With the number of US forces in Iraq scheduled to increase  not decrease   that  s the only way I think you can fairly consider the decision with respect to the 172nd Stryker brigade            So  Mr  Secretary  as we return to our states for the August recess  our constituents have a lot questions and concerns about the current state of affairs in both Iraq and Afghanistan   I don  t need to remind any of us that we continue to lose our young men and women    120 from New York alone   Besides the US loses  violence does seem to be increasing   From January to June of this year there were 14 338 Iraqi civilian casualties  at least as far as anyone can count   In May and June alone  more than 5 000 deaths and 5 700 injuries   In a July 22 article in the New York Times  General Abizaid was quoted as saying    Two months after the new Iraqi government took office  the security gains that we had hoped for had not been achieved              Then  there was the big ballyhooed announcement of   Forward Together    and the commitment by the new Iraqi government to secure Baghdad   Two months into that  it  s clear it  s not working  and we are putting in more American troops and following the lead of Senator McCain  s line of questioning  removing them from other places that are hardly stable and secure            In Afghanistan  your Administration  s credibility is also suspect   In December 2002  you said    The Taliban are gone      In December 2004  President Bush said  the   Taliban no longer is in existence      However this February  DIA Director Lieutenant General Maples said that in 2005 attacks by the Taliban and other anti coalition forces were up 20 percent from 2004 levels and these insurgents were a greater threat to the Afghan government  s effort to expand its authority than in any time since 2001   Further  Gen  Eikenberry made a comparable comment with respect to the dangers that are now going in Afghanistan and the failure to be able to secure it   Obviously  I could go on and on            A recent book  aptly titled Fiasco  describes in some detail the decision making apparatus that has lead us to this situation   So Mr  Secretary  when our constituents ask for evidence that your policy in Iraq and Afghanistan will be successful  you don  t leave us with much to talk about   Yes  we hear a lot of happy talk and rosy scenarios  but because of the Administration  s strategic blunders  and frankly the record of incompetence in executing  you are presiding over a failed policy   Given your track record  Secretary Rumsfeld  why should we believe your assurances now       Secretary Rumsfeld   My goodness   First  I have tried to make notes and to follow the prepared statements you  ve presented           First of all  it  s true  there is sectarian conflict in Iraq and there is a loss of life and it  s an unfortunate and tragic thing that that  s taking place   And it is true that there are people who are attempting to prevent that government from being successful   And they are the people who are blowing up buildings and killing innocent men  women  and children and taking off the heads of people on television and the idea of their prevailing is unacceptable            Second  you said the number of troops were wrong   I guess history will make a judgment on that   The number of troops that went in and the number of troops that were there every month since  and the number of troops that are there today reflected the best judgment of the military commanders on the ground  their superiors  General Pace  General Abizaid  the civilian leadership of the Department of Defense and the President of the United States   I think it  s not correct to assume that they were wrong numbers  and I don  t think the evidence suggests that and it will be interesting to see what history decides   The balance between having too many and contributing to an insurgency by a feeling of occupation and the risk of having too few and having the security situation not be sufficient for the political progress to go forward  is a complicated set of decisions and I don  t know that there  s any guidebook that tells you how to do it   There  s no rule book  there  s no history for this   And the judgments that have been made have been made by exceedingly well trained people  the gentleman sitting next to me  the people on the ground in Iraq   They were studied and examined and analyzed by the civilian leadership and by the President  and they were confirmed   So I think your assertion is at least debatable            The idea that the army was disbanded I think is one that  s kind of flying around   My impression is that  to a great extent  that army disbanded itself   Our forces came in so fast  It was made up of a lot of Shia conscripts who didn  t want to be in it and thousands or at least many  many hundreds of Sunni generals who weren  t about to hang around after Saddam Hussein and his sons and administration were replaced   The work to build a new army has included an awful lot of the people from the prior army  and it has benefited from that            Third  the assertion that the government rejected all the planning that had been done before is just simply false    that  s not the case   The planning that had been done before was taken into account by the people who were executing the post major combat operations activities   The comments about Baghdad  I  ll possibly let General Abizaid comment on  the goal is not to have US forces do the heavy lifting in Bagdad   There are many  many more Iraqi forces in Baghdad   The role of the US forces is to help them  to provide logistics  to assist them as needed  and to create a presence that will allow the Iraqi security forces to succeed and then as our forces step back  allow the Iraqi security forces to be sufficient to maintain order in the city   I can  t predict if it will work this time   It may  or it may not  it happens to represent the best judgment of General Casey  General Chiarelli and the military leadership   And General Abizaid and General Pace and I have reviewed it  and we think that it is a sensible approach  as General Abizaid testified earlier          Afghanistan   I don  t know who said what about where the Taliban had gone  but in fact the Taliban that were running Afghanistan and ruling Afghanistan were replaced  and they were replaced by an election that took place in that country  and in terms of a government or a governing entity  they were gone   and that  s a fact   Are there still Taliban around   You bet   Are they occupying safe havens in Afghanistan and other places  correction in Pakistan and other places  Certainly they are   Is the violence up  Yes   Does the violence tend to be up during the summer and spring  summer  and fall months  Yes it does   And it tends to decline during the winter period   Does that represent failed policy   I don  t know  I would say not   I think you  ve got an awful lot of very talented people engaged in this  and the decisions that are being made are being made with great care after a great deal of consideration   Are there setbacks   Yes   Are there things that people can  t anticipate   Yes   Does the enemy have a brain and continue to make adjustments on the ground  requiring our forces to continue to make adjustments   You bet   Is that going to continue to be the case  I think so   Is this problem going to get solved in the near term about this violence struggle against extremism   No  I don  t believe it is   I think it  s going to take some time   And I know the question was some wars lasted three years  some wars lasted four years  some wars lasted five years   The Cold War lasted 40 plus years   And the struggle against violent extremists who are determined to prevent free people from exercising their rights as free people is going to go on a long time and it  s going to be a tough one   That does not mean that we have to spend the rest of our lives as United States armed forces in Iraq   The Iraqis are going to have to take that over   We can want freedom more for the Iraqi people than they want for themselves   And Senator Thune mentioned earlier about that issue   And I would point out  the number of tips that have been coming from Iraqi people have been going up steadily  they  re at a very high level  and it does suggest to me that the Iraqi people do want to have a free country  as I mentioned  because of their voting patterns   So I would disagree strongly with your statement        Senator Clinton   Well Mr  Secretary  I know you would and I know you feel strongly about it  but there  s a track record here   This is not 2002  2003  2004 5  when you appeared before this committee and made many comments and presented many assurances that have frankly proven to be unfulfilled   And        Secretary Rumsfeld   Senator  I don  t think that  s true   I  ve never painted a rosy picture   I  ve been very measured in my words   And you  d have a dickens of a time trying to finds instances where I  ve been excessively optimistic   I understand this is tough stuff       Senator Clinton   Well  Mr  Chairman  I would like unanimous consent to submit for the record a number of the Secretary  s former comments  and also may we keep the record open for additional questions       Mr  Chairman   Record will remain open until the close of business today for all members to contribute additional questions       Sen  Clinton   Thank you  Mr  Chairman                      Past Headlines  Statement of Senator Clinton on Secretary Rumsfeld  s Decision to Reverse
