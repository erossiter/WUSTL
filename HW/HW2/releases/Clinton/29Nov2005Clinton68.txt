November 29  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Release of the EPA  s World Trade Center Testing Plan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            While the plan includes modest improvements over the prior EPA indoor cleanup program  it fails to correct the major problems identified by EPA  s Inspector General in 2003   For example  the plan does not include testing in north of Canal Street or in Brooklyn  in spite of the Inspector General  s conclusion that the cleanup boundaries were not scientifically developed   In addition  the plan ignores many of the recommendations made by the World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel over the last 20 months   Finally  the EPA  s proposal today to disband the Panel after the next meeting is unacceptable   The Panel has not even begun to meet its mandate to identify unmet public health needs and recommend any steps to further minimize the risks associated with the aftermath of the World Trade Center attacks   I will be fighting to ensure that the Panel completes this important task
