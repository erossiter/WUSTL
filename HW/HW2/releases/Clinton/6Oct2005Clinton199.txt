October 6  2005 Senator Clinton Welcomes Over  800 000 From USDA for Clarkson University Energy Digester Project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today welcomed news from the U S  Department of Agriculture that Clarkson University is to receive  805 938 for their dairy waste to energy project   The announcement was made today by the Secretary of Agriculture  The funds will be made available through the Biomass Research and Development Initiative  a joint effort of USDA and the Department of Energy  DOE             Clarkson has been a leader in developing agricultural waste recovery systems and I am so pleased that the USDA has recognized its achievements     said Senator Clinton who supported Clarkson s application for the grant     This funding will be critical for developing the technology that will help farmers reduce their energy costs and give them on farm value added opportunities   This work will also have positive environmental and economic impacts for upstate New York              A copy of the Senator  s letter of support is attached          April 28  2005         The Honorable Mike Johanns  Secretary  United States Department of Agriculture  1400 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20250         Dear Secretary Johanns          I am writing in support of Clarkson University of New York  s application to the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  for funding for the University s dairy waste to energy project          Clarkson University researchers are seeking to build a state of the art digester energy recovery system at a working dairy farm and use the results to provide a basis for extending digester energy system technologies across Northern New York State  The farm will be used to showcase emerging technologies and collect data on the mass and energy flows to validate a computer model to optimize the system  Researchers will survey farmers to identify critical issues and mechanisms required to overcome the barriers for implementation of such systems at other farms  The proposed technology could help farmers reduce their energy costs and make it economically feasible for them to generate additional income by raising cash crops in greenhouses heated by waste from the farm  s operation or other income generators such as small cheese making operations          The North Country dairy industry has been challenged recently by the closure of some of the area  s cheese plants as well as the impact of environmental regulations and limitations of the existing dairy to fuel technology   Clarkson  s research team  led by Stefan Grimberg and Susan Powers  received  50 000 in 2004 from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority  NYSERDA  for a project feasibility study  The study concluded that the proposed digester energy recovery system would provide an efficient alternative to expensive fossil fuels currently used to meet the farm heat and electrical power needs of America  s farmers          I ask that you please give careful consideration to this proposal          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
