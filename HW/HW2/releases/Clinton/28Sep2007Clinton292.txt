                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The American Home Ownership Preservation Act Will Crack Down on Unscrupulous Mortgage Brokers  Help Prevent Foreclosures  and Promote Affordable Housing Initiatives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC   In light of the ongoing turmoil in the housing market and the uncertainty surrounding millions of homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced the introduction of the American Home Ownership Protection Act  The legislation contains a number of proposals that would regulate unscrupulous mortgage brokers  empower borrowers with better disclosure about their mortgages and better information on their mortgage professionals  and eliminate the worst elements of abusive mortgage products  Moreover  the legislation would set aside funding to help supplement foreclosure relief and prevention efforts at the state and local level and help support affordable housing funds throughout the country   With the recent discouraging housing data  we need to take swift action to help restore consumer confidence in the housing market and curb the abusive lending practices and mortgage products that helped spawn the current crisis  said Senator Clinton  This legislation is a common sense proposal to help achieve those goals and helps families caught in the current housing slump to avoid foreclosure and mortgage default  I hope that the Senate takes up these proposals quickly   The American Home Ownership Protection Act includes   Ensure Full Disclosure of Mortgage Broker Compensation to Homebuyers  The Clinton legislation would require mortgage brokers to disclose to prospective homebuyers how their compensation increases if they steer the homebuyer to a more expensive mortgage product with higher rates and fees  Given that brokers and homebuyers interests are not always the same  borrowers need to be aware of this when assessing the advice brokers give them    Require Federal Registration for Mortgage Brokers A major component of the current housing crisis was unscrupulous mortgage brokers steering homebuyers into high cost and high fee mortgages  qualifying borrowers for unaffordable mortgages  and attaching fees unnecessarily  Currently  there is no national clearinghouse for information about individual mortgage brokers  The Clinton legislation would require registration for all mortgage brokers so that prospective borrowers can easily look up a broker s employment history  violations  complaints  and other information so that they can make an informed decision about their mortgage    Eliminate Abusive Prepayment Penalties on all Mortgages Prepayment penalties which significantly increase the risk of mortgage default are often used on subprime and non traditional mortgages and are a problem for borrowers  These penalties can lock borrowers into loans until the rates and monthly payments escalate  Families should not be discouraged from responsibly paying off their mortgages early  particularly when this would allow them to avoid higher rates later The Clinton bill would eliminate this practice on all mortgages    Prevent Foreclosures  The Clinton bill would establish a  1 billion fund to assist state programs that help at risk borrowers avoid foreclosure  Many states have established partnerships with the nonprofit sector and housing industry enterprises to help borrowers renegotiate their loan terms  become current on their payments or simply provide financial counseling  These foreclosure mitigation efforts are more important than ever right now as the most recent housing data indicate a protracted slump   Expand Fannie Mae s and Freddie Mac s Foreclosure Prevention Efforts The Clinton legislation would expand the goals of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  the government sponsored enterprises  GSEs  that help stabilize the mortgage markets  to include helping a larger number of at risk homeowners avoid foreclosure  This would be consistent with Fannie s and Freddie s existing goals that promote home ownership  The GSEs already help mitigate foreclosures by enabling some borrowers to swap into less risky  lower cost loans  Fannie also helps homeowners arrange payment forbearance  financial counseling  and loan restructurings    Expand Affordable Housing  The Clinton legislation establishes a  1 billion fund to support state  county  and municipal housing trust funds  Housing trust funds generally use dedicated funding sources to support initiatives like building subsidized rental housing and safety net housing  and they also support nonprofit housing developers  The fund would supplement the funding states  counties  and municipalities have already dedicated to these initiatives    Increase Mortgage Fraud Investigation and Prosecution Efforts The Clinton legislation would provide additional funding for the FBI and Department of Justice to hire more agents and prosecutors to investigate and prosecute mortgage fraud schemes  one of the fastest growing criminal enterprises  throughout the nation  Schemes like house flipping  phony appraisals  and unscrupulous mortgage lending cost home buyers and lenders millions of dollars each year and have contributed to the current housing crisis   The American Home Ownership Preservation Act follows Senator Clintons initiative in addressing the subprime mortgage crisis  including calling for expanded access to independent face to face counseling  requiring plain talk  no fine print disclosure  and encouraging foreclosure timeouts in which at risk borrowers and lenders work out alternatives to foreclosure  She has also introduced the 21st Century Housing Act which will modernize the Federal Housing Administration so that it can be a viable alternative to the subprime mortgage market
