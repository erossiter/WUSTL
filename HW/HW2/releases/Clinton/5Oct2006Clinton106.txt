October 5  2006 Senator Clinton Welcomes News that Canandaigua VA Hospital will Remain Open                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Today Regarding the Future of the Canandaigua VA Hospital          Washington  DC     I am delighted that the Department of Veterans   Affairs has announced its decision to keep the Canandaigua VA facility open and on this campus    where it belongs   I wrote to the Department of Veterans Affairs last month  asking for an update on the planning for the Canandaigua VA because we hadn t heard anything in over a year  I am thrilled that our collective efforts have paid off here in Canandaigua  The right choice has been made today          The decision announced today is a testament to the support that veterans and the community have shown for the facility  I am so pleased that their tireless work    the thousands of letters  the public meetings and the continued pressure on the VA   has finally paid off  Without such a dedicated local effort  keeping the Canandaigua VA open would have been a much bigger challenge           With U S  troops serving bravely in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world  now is the time to reaffirm the pact we have made as a country with our veterans    that those who serve have access to quality health care at VA facilities   This victory for Canandaigua is just such an affirmation             This decision is important not only for the VA  but also for the New York veterans who have relied on the critical services provided by the Canandaigua center since the 1930  s  I have been deeply engaged in the VA  s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services process since 2003   During that time  I have worked hard  first with Secretary Principi and now with Secretary Nicholson  to ensure that the VA gives the needs of New York veterans and the concerns of the local community the full consideration they deserve            As the CARES process moves forward in the months ahead  I will continue to work with Secretary Nicholson to ensure that the VA engages fully with the local community to understand the needs and concerns of our veterans   The community has been anxiously awaiting a decision on the future of the Canandaigua VA and I hope that the VA is able to come to a decision on options by the Spring deadline  I am confident that the best final solution    for the VA  for New York veterans and for Canandaigua alike    is for the facility to continue to provide high quality health care services available to present and future veterans
