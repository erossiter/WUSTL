February 28  2007 In Remarks on Senate Floor Senator Clinton Urges Action to Address U S  Foreign Debt and Trade Imbalance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mr  President  we are in the middle of an ongoing discussion and debate over our homeland security  and certainly  as all of us know  this remains a matter of grave concern  Homeland security means many things  and it certainly does mean that we fully and appropriately fund our police and our fire  It means that we guard our ports and our infrastructure  like our tunnels and our bridges  all of which is going to be the subject of the authorization legislation brought forward by the Chairman and Ranking Member  But  Mr  President  it also means that we have to remain strong at home and that we have to have the economic resources to spend on protecting ourselves           Yesterday  the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 416 points  the largest single drop since the markets reopened after the September 11 attacks  And while our markets were reeling  alarm bells were ringing once again over the irresponsible fiscal and economic policies of this Administration that continue to surrender the economic sovereignty of our country to foreign banks  investors  and governments piece by piece  Yesterday s stock market disruption came on the heels of pessimistic economic news on the home front and ominous comments about recession by former Fed Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  So while it can  and will be debated whether yesterday s market fluctuation was a blip or a larger indicator of our economy s vulnerabilities  it is clear that what happened underscores the exposure of our economy to a combination of economic developments in countries like China and economic policies here at home  A scare in the Chinese stock market  based on rumors within that country  sent economic reverberations around the world           In terms of our fiscal stability  we are in uncharted waters  Markets  to a certain degree  will always be volatile  and to a great extent we are fortunate that our domestic markets are deep enough to absorb certain shocks  But there is no precedent in U S  history for an economy as large as ours to be as heavily in debt to its trading partners as the United States is to countries like China  Japan  and others           When it comes to the fiscal recklessness and economic fatalism of the current Administration  the writing may not be on the wall  but yesterday the writing was on the Big Board  In the face of this challenge  the economic policies of the last six years have contributed to an erosion of U S  economic sovereignty and have made us more dependent on the economic decisions of other nations  As I have proposed  and continue to support  we need to take steps to restore fiscal responsibility and sound economic policies based on the facts  not ideology  I will continue to support legislative steps to require that the Bush Administration address mounting fiscal and trade imbalances           Today I sent a letters to Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Fed Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke urging them to address many of our underlying economic vulnerabilities resulting from our debt and deficits  Our nation has been running record deficits and digging a massive fiscal hole of nearly  8 8 trillion as foreign countries have been buying our debt and  in essence  becoming our bankers  According to the most recent Treasury statistics  foreign nations now hold more than  2 2 trillion or 44 percent of all publicly held U S  debt  Japan and China alone hold nearly  1 trillion  To put it plainly  16 percent of our entire economy is being loaned to us by the Central Banks of other nations  I know other members of this Chamber like Senator Conrad  the Chairman of our Budget Committee  share my concern over the implications of this massive foreign debt  And while the foundations of our fiscal house are eroded by our fiscal policies  our failure to pursue smart economic policies have added strains on our economy  Every single year since President Bush took office  we ve had a record trade deficit  Last year  the deficit was  764 billion  And one of the ramifications of that trade deficit to foreign interests  is the control by foreign interests of more and more of our assets           How can we negotiate fair  pro American trade agreements  and ensure foreign countries uphold these agreements  when we sit across the negotiating table  not only from our competitor  but from our banker as well  And while ceding our economic sovereignty  we also sow the seeds of economic vulnerability  Precipitous decisions by any country holding our debt could create much graver economic problems than what we saw yesterday           Now  I believe in smart  pro American trade  and globalization does hold incredible promise to continue to improve our standard of living and to create economic growth  But for too long  the choices have been painted far too starkly and with a broad political brush  In fact  we can protect our economic interests while promoting trade  We can secure our economic sovereignty while promoting policies that secure our global economic position  Trade does not have to be a zero sum game           The choice is not between fatalism and protectionism  The choice is between policies that work and policies that are not working  We have to curb these deficits and ensure foreign governments do not own too much of our government debt  We need a firewall that keeps our economic future more in our own hands           In years past  I ve worked with other members of Congress who share my concerns  For example  during the last session of Congress  I supported legislation by Senator Dorgan and then Congressman Cardin that rings an alarm bell when U S  foreign owned debt reaches 25 percent of GDP or the trade deficit reaches 5 percent of GDP  It would require the Administration to develop a plan of action to address these conditions and report their findings to Congress  At the very least  this proposal would compel our government to deal with these economic issues while they are problems  but before they become crises  I believe proposals like these need to be considered in order to put our economic house in order  as we can too easily be held hostage to the economic policies that are being made  not in Washington and not in the markets of New York  but in Beijing  Shanghai  Tokyo  and elsewhere           Yesterday  it was the sell off of foreign stocks that had reverberations in U S  markets  But if China or Japan made a decision to decrease their massive holdings of U S  dollars  there could be a currency crisis and the United States that would have to raise interest rates and invite conditions for a recession  Precipitous decisions by any country holding our debt could create far graver economic consequences than what we witnessed yesterday           While it is clear we should take reasonable steps now to ensure that the economic problems of today do not become the crises of tomorrow  we are awaiting some action by the Administration that gives us a clear signal that we can begin to restore responsibility  This is a long term problem  but it is one that I think we must respond to  We ignore at our peril           And as we saw yesterday  the United States is interconnected with globalized markets  They are not going to leave anyone out  We will all be impacted by decisions that we have nothing to do with making  even if they are rumors or quickly reversed  So  Mr  President  it is my hope that what happened yesterday  that gave us headlines across the world  will open our eyes to what we need to do to take action  to put ourselves in a much more competitive position and to begin to move away from the loss of economic sovereignty that we have seen over the last years  And  Mr  President  I yield the floor               Read Senator Clinton s letter
