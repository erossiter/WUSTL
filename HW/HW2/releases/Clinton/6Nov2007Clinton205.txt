November 6  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Her Opposition to the Nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be Attorney General of the United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              With todays vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee  Judge Mukaseys nomination to be the next Attorney General of the United States now goes to the full Senate for consideration   As I have stated  I oppose Judge Mukaseys nomination   I believe we need an Attorney General who has the strength to challenge this Administration when it is wrong  who is committed to reestablishing the independence of the Department of Justice and to restoring respect for the Constitution and the rule of law  I remain deeply troubled by Judge Mukaseys continued unwillingness to clearly state his views on torture and unchecked Executive power   We cannot send a signal that the next Attorney General in any way condones torture or believes that the President is unconstrained by law  When we leave any doubt about our nations policy on torture  we send a terrible message to the rest of the world   Judge Mukaseys failure to clarify his answers and categorically oppose the unacceptable interrogation techniques employed by this Administration leaves me no choice but to oppose his nomination
