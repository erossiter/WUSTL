March 18  2005 Senator Clinton Announces National Governors Association Endorsement of TRICARE Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the National Governors Association has endorsed bipartisan legislation that she introduced with Senator Lindsey Graham  SC  to improve benefits for National Guard and Reserve members and their families   The Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005 would promote recruitment  readiness and retention by offering TRICARE military healthcare benefits to members of the Guard and Reserve for a modest monthly premium             Our nation  s governors know first hand the critical role our guard members and reservists are playing in both our homeland security and in our military operations overseas   And they recognize that the benefits we offer our guard members and reservists need to keep up with the times     said Senator Clinton     That  s why it is so significant that the National Governors Association has endorsed the bipartisan effort that I am leading with Senator Lindsey Graham to provide access to health care benefits to every guard member and reservist  regardless of their activation status             The role of the guard members and reservists has changed fundamentally since the September 11 attacks   In the years since  the guard members and reservists have experienced their largest sustained mobilization since World War II   These servicemen and women include the 42nd Infantry Division based in Troy  New York  the first complete National Guard division to be deployed to a combat zone since the Korean War   Today  the total number of Reservists on active duty is 183 251 people   Over 40 percent of our forces in Iraq are Reservists             Senator Clinton emphasized that a major challenge is making sure our guard members and reservists are ready to serve when called to duty   During the mobilization of Reserve Component members in Operation Iraqi Freedom  the Reserves discovered that a significant number of the activated servicemen and women were not medically fit for deployment   In addition  about 20 percent did not have any health insurance at all            To address this problem  the TRICARE legislation would provide every Guardsman and Reservist  along with their families  access to health care whether or not they are on active duty   Senators Clinton and Graham are working with their colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass the legislation this year                Members of the National Guard and Reserve and their families in New York and across the country are making extraordinary personal sacrifices as they serve their country with courage and distinction   Doing right by them shows that we honor the service these troops give valiantly to our nation     said Senator Clinton     Providing the Guard and Reserves  as well as their families  with adequate support and benefits is the least that a grateful nation can do
