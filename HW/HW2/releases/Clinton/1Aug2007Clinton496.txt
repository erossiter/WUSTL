August 1  2007 Senator Clinton Calls for Passage of Bill to Enable More Children to Benefit from the Children s Health Insurance Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Urges Support for Clinton Amendment to Extend Family and Medical Leave for Families of Wounded Soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today spoke on the floor of the Senate  urging passage of legislation to cover more children under the State Children s Health Insurance Program  SCHIP    She also called on her colleagues to support bipartisan legislation  cosponsored by Senators Dole  Mikulski  Graham  Kennedy and Brown  that she has introduced as an amendment to the SCHIP bill that would extend the Family and Medical Leave Act  FMLA  for up to six months for spouses and parents of soldiers who have been injured in combat   The amendment would enact a key recommendation of the Commission on Care for Americas Returning Wounded Warriors      The following is a transcript of Senator Clinton s remarks on the Senate floor     Mr  President  I want to thank my colleague from Washington for her usual  very thorough  and persuasive statement on the floor about the need for flexibility in this important program and the recognition that healthcare  like everything else  costs differently depending upon where you are in the country  And I thank the Senator from Washington for reinforcing that important point     But the larger point is this  today in this Congress  we are on the verge of providing the greatest expansion of health coverage for our children since the creation of the Children s Health Insurance Program a decade ago  I believe  and I don t imagine anyone in this chamber would argue  with the belief that every child deserves a healthy start in life  Certainly  we try to provide that healthy start for our own children and we give a lot of lip service to the idea that we should provide it for all children  yet far too many children in our nation    more than nine million    do not have healthcare     I was very proud to help create the State Children s Health Insurance Program during the Clinton Administration  working on this legislation during my time as First Lady  And after the bill passed  I worked to get the word out and try to help more children and their parents understand what this new program could mean for them and encourage them to sign up in the first few years  In the Senate  I have continued that effort  fighting to ensure healthcare for children has the priority in our budget that it deserves     So today  thanks to the work of so many  CHIP provides health insurance for six million children  Now  in New York alone  almost 400 000 children benefit from this program every month     With the legislation that Chairman Baucus and Senators Grassley  Rockefeller and Hatch helped to craft  an additional 50 000 children in my state of New York will have access to health insurance coverage  This legislation will also help enroll many of the 300 000 children in New York who live in families that are already eligible because their families make less than  52 000 a year  250 percent of the poverty level for a family of four  In total across our country  3 2 million children who are uninsured will gain coverage   That will reduce the number of uninsured children by  one third over the next five years      Now  Mr  President  if we can afford tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and tax cuts for oil companies that are making record profits  I certainly think we can find it in our hearts and budget to help cover millions of children who deserve a healthy start     I want to be clear  if the president vetoes this bill  he will be vetoing healthcare for more than three million children  And once again the President will have put ideology  not children  first     Earlier this year  I was proud to introduce legislation with Congressman John Dingell to reauthorize and expand CHIP  and I m very pleased that a number of the ideas in our bill are included in this legislation  such as cutting the red tape and bolstering incentives to get eligible children into the program     The legislation also improves access to private coverage and expands access to benefits like mental health and dental coverage  This is so important    And I really applaud the Finance Committee under Chairman Baucus  leadership   Mental health and dental coverage are too often left out when we talk about healthcare      Well  not far from where I m standing  in the state of Maryland  last year  a young boy  Deamonte Driver  had a toothache  And his mother sought help for him to be able to get dental care  She called dentists  but they weren t taking any more children on Medicaid or on CHIP  and then she got help from a legal aid group that helped poor families  They called around  and I think they called 27 or 28 dentists who said  look  our quota for poor kids is filled     Well  Deamonte Driver s toothache turned into an abscess  And the abscess burst  infecting his bloodstream  and he ended up in the hospital where doctors valiantly tried to save his life from the brain infection that resulted from the abscessed tooth that had not been treated  This young man died     And when one thinks about the loss of a child over something that started as a toothache  it is heartbreaking  but it is not by any means an isolated case  And at the end of Deamonte s life  the state of Maryland and the United States government ended up paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for emergency care  for intensive care  for life support to no avail  for want of  80 100 to find a dentist who would care for Deamonte     So  I really commend the authors of this bipartisan bill for their work and for bringing forward a practical  fiscally responsible compromise that will allow us to reauthorize this important program and expand coverage  And I m eager to see that it is signed into law     I am disappointed  however  that the bill we are considering this week fails to include the Legal Immigrant Children s Health Improvement Act  which I introduced with Senator Snowe   Senator Snowe and I have been working on this for a number of years  This bipartisan bill would give states the flexibility to provide the same Medicaid and CHIP coverage to low income  legal immigrant children and pregnant women as is provided to U S  Citizens  I will underscore that  we are talking about legal immigrant children and legal pregnant women     I really believe that we should provide this flexibility to states because the current restrictions prevent thousands of legal immigrant children and pregnant women from receiving preventive health services and treatment for minor illnesses before they become serious  Families who are unable to access care for their children have little choice but to turn to emergency rooms  And this hurts children and pregnant women  plain and simple   And I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to lift the ban on Medicaid and CHIP coverage for low income  legal immigrant children and pregnant women     I also am disappointed that some of my colleagues have expressed concern about states like New York  New Jersey and others that have chosen to cover children above 300 percent of the poverty level  The legislation we are considering on the floor would allow New York to continue doing this and receive the CHIP matching rate  We should not punish children and their families who live in high cost areas and who need healthcare coverage  And I encourage my colleagues to vote against any effort to undermine the extension of healthcare in high cost states where it costs more  as we heard from Senator Cantwell and her statement on the floor  to provide the same coverage and treatment one would get elsewhere in our country     So  I m proud that we are debating a bill to expand healthcare to 3 2 million children  But the fact is  there should be no debating the moral crisis of nine million children without healthcare  no debating the moral urgency of strengthening our healthcare system for children and all Americans  Ultimately  Mr  President  the answer will be in a cost effective  quality driven  uniquely American program that provides healthcare to every single man  woman  and child in our country  But until we get to that point  it is imperative that the Congress pass this bill before we go out for recess and send it to the president with the hope that he will sign it into law     I would also like to mention another issue we urgently need to address  Last week  the bipartisan Commission on Care for America s Returning Wounded Warriors    chaired by former Senator Bob Dole and former Secretary of Health and Human Services  Donna Shalala    issued its final report on the need to reform the medical care that our troops and veterans receive     The commission found  in an excellent reportit s not one of these commission reports that just take up a lot of space on the shelf  its very pointed with six specific recommendationsand it found that one of the most important ways to improve care for injured servicemembers is to improve support for their families  That s why I introduced a bipartisan bill  the Military Family and Medical Leave Act with Senators Dole  Mikulski  Graham  Kennedy and Brown  to implement a key recommendation of the commission  And we have offered this as an amendment to the CHIP legislation     The Family and Medical Leave Act was the first bill signed into law under the Clinton Administration  It came about because of a lot of hard work led by Senator Dodd here in the Senate and others  and it has proven to be enormously successful  helping more than 60 million men and women who try to balance the demands of work and family  I believe it is time to strengthen the Act for military families who find themselves in a very difficult situation  They should be given up to six months of leave to care for a loved one who has sustained a combat related injury     Currently  these spouses  parents  and children can receive only 12 weeks of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act  All too often  this is just not enough time  as injured servicemembers grapple with traumatic brain injuries  severe physical wounds and other problems upon returning from Iraq  Afghanistan  and elsewhere     In fact  33 percent of active duty  22 percent of reservists  and 37 percent of retired servicemembers reported to the commission that a family member or close friend had to leave their homes for extended periods of time to help them in the hospital  About 20 percent said family or friends gave up jobs to be with them to act as their caregiver     This is a step that we can take immediately that will make a real difference  Many of us have been to hospitals here in our own countryWalter Reed  Brook Army Medical Center   and other places in the world  like Landstuhl in Germany  where we ve seen our wounded warriors  There is no doubt that having the support  assistance and comfort of a family member during that process when a young man or woman who has served our country is brought from the battlefield to the hospital  makes a big difference in recovery and rehabilitation  I think all of us agree that not only do our men and women in uniform make tremendous sacrifices on our behalf  so do their families  And as a nation  we have a duty to provide them with the support that they deserve to have     So  Mr  President  expanding access to healthcare for children and providing better support for our military families comes down to basic values that we as Americans hold dear  I think we all agree every child deserves a healthy start and every man or woman who wears the uniform of our country deserves more than words of support  The promise of America is rooted in these values  and I am very proud to support the bipartisan legislation expanding healthcare for children  And I urge my colleagues to join me and the Senators from both sides of the aisle who are supporting our military families who are caring for those who have been injured in service to our country     And  Mr  President  finally  we hope that on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue there will be a change of heart  that the president will decide to sign this legislation and relieve the burdens of ill health and inadequate access to healthcare that haunt the lives of so many American families  Mr  President  please support this effort in every way possible by signing the legislation that will be sent to you  I yield the floor
