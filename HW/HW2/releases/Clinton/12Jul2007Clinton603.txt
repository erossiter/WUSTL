July 12  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Following Her Meeting with Secretary Chertoff Today Regarding the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I am pleased that the Secretary took the time to meet with us today and we appreciate his efforts to understand the very real needs of the Northern Border when it comes to both security and the economy     We made it clear today that it is important that we explore all options when it comes to developing a plan that addresses the economic realities of the region without compromising our security  We need a better option that protects our borders while acknowledging the very real needs of local businesses and residents     The Department of Homeland Security can no longer ignore the concerns of communities along the Northern Border and there appears to be some effort by the Department to address their concerns  While I appreciate the Secretarys efforts to implement a pilot program for WHTI compliant enhanced drivers licenses  there are many questions that still need to be addressed by the Administration   We did make some progress today but I believe that the devil is in the details   He have heard a lot of talk from the Secretary on this issue before and now we want to see exactly what he plans to do     The Administration must be forthcoming about the level of safety and security that such a proposal would provide  The Secretary also needs to assure New York that the federal government will provide the necessary support for any pilot program and that the financial burden is not simply left to the State  For this pilot program to work it needs to be properly implemented  funded and monitored  We are all looking for a program that will not compromise our homeland security or the flow of commerce along our Northern Border  I hope that the Secretary will finally help us achieve the proper balance
