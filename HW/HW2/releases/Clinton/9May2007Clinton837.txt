                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Bill is Companion to Clinton Legislation Introduced this Year                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today applauded Representative Salazar  D CO  for introducing comprehensive broadband legislation in the House of Representatives  companion legislation to the Rural Broadband Initiatives Act  S  1032  she introduced in the Senate this year   The legislation creates a policy and action framework to ensure that the federal government employs an effective and comprehensive strategy to deploy broadband service and access in the rural areas of the United States            Many areas in New York State and across the country still do not have access to broadband   I applaud the leadership of my colleague  Representative Salazar who has helped to foster innovation and growth  increase access to broadband and ensure that the government plays a helpful role in furthering economic development by increasing broadband connectivity in rural areas   said Senator Clinton           I look forward to working with Senator Clinton to give rural Americans critical access to broadband services   I believe that homes  small businesses  farms and ranches in Colorado and throughout the country need this important piece of legislation to help improve the economic well being of their communities   said Representative Salazar            Senator Clinton joined with fellow members of Congress and leading rural organizations earlier this year to call for strong rural development provisions in the next farm bill and further discuss her proposed rural initiatives that were first outlined in a major speech given in Lockport  New York that highlighted needed efforts for rural communities   Senator Clinton s rural broadband bill would establish an Office of Rural Broadband Initiatives at the Department of Agriculture and create an Undersecretary for Rural Broadband to be charged with coordinating several rural broadband grant and loan programs aimed at encouraging broadband infrastructure investment in underserved rural areas   Among the programs that would fall under the new Office s jurisdiction is the Rural Broadband Access and Loan Guarantee program  which has been criticized for being too cumbersome and having qualification criteria too stringent to benefit the small  innovative telecommunications companies willing to invest in rural areas  This bill would require the Undersecretary to streamline and improve the program to ensure that loans and grants are being made to telecommunications companies with sound business plans  Moreover  the Undersecretary would be charged with developing a comprehensive rural broadband strategy to facilitate broadband access in rural areas as quickly as possible           Also  the bill would establish a Rural Broadband Innovation Fund that would invest in experimental and cutting edge applications that can deliver broadband service to rural areas including satellite  fiber  WiFi  and broadband over power lines  BPL   Finally the bill would establish a Rural Broadband Advisory Panel that would include members of both the public and private sector to discuss issues relating to broadband deployment and offer advice and guidance to the Undersecretary in developing a comprehensive rural broadband strategy           Broadband deployment has traditionally lagged in rural areas due to geography  population and lack of a viable market for large telecommunications companies  The Government Accountability Office has indicated that while about 30 percent of households in urban and suburban areas have access to broadband  only 17 percent of rural households have access           The legislation builds on Senator Clinton s longstanding commitment to fostering broadband access in rural areas  She  along with Congressman John McHugh  NY 23   has urged the Rural Utilities Service Administrator to make improvements to the Rural Broadband Access and Loan Guarantee Program that has been slow in processing loans to companies willing to invest in broadband infrastructure in rural areas  They also urged that the RUS address the program s rigid qualification criteria which are too strict to allow small  upstart telecom companies from participating in the program           In addition to urging greater private investment in rural broadband deployment  Senator Clinton has cosponsored legislation that would provide telecom companies that build and invest in broadband networks in rural  underserved areas tax incentives to encourage more investments  This Congress  she has cosponsored S  1147  a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the expensing of broadband Internet access expenditures sponsored by Senator John D  Rockefeller  D WV   which allows companies that build broadband networks in rural areas to deduct the costs of their investment
