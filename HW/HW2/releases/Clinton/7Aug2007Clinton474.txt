August 7  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on South Korean Hostages Being Held by the Taliban                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    My thoughts and prayers go out to the group of 21 South Koreans currently being held by the Taliban  and with their loved ones   I also extend my deepest sympathies to the families of the two hostages that were mercilessly executed by their Taliban captors last week   I am hopeful that all of the remaining hostages will be released in good health as soon as possible  and I call on the Government of Afghanistan  the Bush Administration and the rest of the international community to work together with the Government of South Korea towards such an outcome   South Korea has played an important role in support of U S  and NATO humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan  and such a terrible act against civilians is unacceptable
