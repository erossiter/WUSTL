                RYE BOOK  NY   Citing the continued problems with our nation  s flu vaccine distribution and delivery system  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  Congresswoman Nita Lowey  Westchester County Executive Andy Spano today joined with local Westchester public health officials to express their concern over local reports of seasonal flu vaccine delivery delays           Delays in flu vaccine distribution have resulted in many patients  especially seniors and other priority populations  waiting to receive influenza vaccine  A survey by the Medical Society of the State of New York found that 60   of doctors surveyed had received either no vaccine or less than 25  of their order by November 1 of this year  Many public health departments across New York have also had issues getting adequate supplies of vaccine and meeting increased demand from consumers  In Westchester County  the flu clinics run by the Department of Health have been booked for some time  and the flu clinic held at the Anthony J  Posillipo Community Center could not service all the seniors who wanted a vaccine  leaving approximately 70 seniors to have to find a vaccine through other means           At the press conference  Senator Clinton stressed the need for legislation to fix our broken flu vaccine system so we can be prepared to handle the annual seasonal flu epidemic  a pandemic or avian flu outbreak   She also called upon the Bush Administration to stop dragging its feet and support the Influenza Vaccine Security Act that she and Senator Pat Roberts  R KS  have introduced to fix the broken vaccine system  Senator Clinton also provided copies of a guidebook she has produced to help New Yorkers get assistance in locating flu vaccines and facts on the threat of seasonal and avian flu             With temperatures dropping and winter right around the corner  New Yorkers are growing increasingly frustrated by their inability to obtain a flu vaccine     Senator Clinton said    I have been contacted by health care providers who can  t figure out why the vaccine they ordered months ago hasn  t arrived  or has come in such short supply that they are unable to vaccinate their patients at greatest risk of getting the flu  Places that haven  t had to cancel flu clinics have been overwhelmed by demand               We must iron out problems with the distribution of flu vaccines now   It s bad enough that residents are not able to get flu shots this year  it will be that much worse if we do have an avian flu pandemic and vaccines still aren t available because of distribution tangles and a lack of production capacity   For the health and safety of New Yorkers  we must fix this now     Congresswoman Lowey Said            We learned last year  when a true shortage existed at the flu manufacturing end   that the federal government must be more involved to make sure we have sufficient flu vaccine and that it gets to the people who need it quickly  This year we are told the issue is just distribution  so where then is the vaccine  I join Sen  Clinton in wanting answers and more important a tracking system so we can pinpoint just where the supplies are and why they are not where they should be     County Executive Spano said          In addition to the problems of vaccine delay  demand is also on the rise  One large distributor has reported that demand for shots is 30 to 40  higher this year compared to 2003  the last time we faced such increased demand for shots   In order to fulfill such a demand  we would need around 100 million flu vaccines    an amount that would strain our current domestic vaccine capacity  and far exceeds the 80 million vaccines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates we will have available for this season              Clearly the system isn  t working  And as concerns over a possible pandemic flu continue to mount  we must have a seasonal flu vaccine production and delivery system that works  That is why I have called on the President to act immediately and support my legislation to create a nationwide vaccine tracking system     Senator Clinton said    But to help seniors and others who need a flu shot now  I am making available a special resource guide on my Senate website to help provide answers to New Yorkers about where they can find out more information about locating flu vaccines   The guide provides a list of agencies that offer assistance to those seeking help in finding seasonal flu vaccine throughout New York State   New Yorkers will also find information on seasonal flu  priority groups for vaccination and tips to protect them from seasonal flu     Senator Clinton added           Along with her colleagues in the Senate  Senator Clinton fought to increase funding for pandemic influenza  so that our country will have the resources    vaccines  medications  and trained health care professionals    to address this threat before it hits our shores           But focusing solely on pandemic flu  as the Administration has done  will not fix the problems that have resulted in the delays and shortages we have faced four times since 2000   Improving our system for the manufacture and distribution of the seasonal flu vaccine will not only help us in the event of a pandemic  but will help us every winter when senior citizens  children  and chronically ill individuals need to get a flu shot to protect them from the virus          That is why Senator Clinton has introduced the Influenza Vaccine Security Act with Senator Pat Roberts  R KS   which will increase coordination between the public and private sectors so that we can set targets and procedures for dealing with shortages before they arise  This bill will also set up a tracking system so the CDC and state and local health departments can share the information they need to ensure that high priority populations will have access to vaccines   Having such information will allow our local health care professionals to better educate and inform patients  It  s easier to teach people about the importance of getting a flu shot if there is a reliable  steady source of seasonal flu vaccine           To access Senator Clinton  s Flu Vaccine Guide  please click here  http   www clinton senate gov documents fluvaccineguide pdf
