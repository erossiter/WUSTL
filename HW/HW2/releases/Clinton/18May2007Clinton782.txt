                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   In light of recent media reports suggesting that a particular body armor system may offer better protection than the system currently being used by our servicemembers  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Jim Webb  D VA    both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee   today called on Comptroller General of the United States David M  Walker to initiate a Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigation to reassess the body armor systems currently being issued by all the military services and the Special Operations Command for effectiveness and reliability against the threats facing U S  troops in combat           With United States troops risking their lives daily in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  we owe it to them to make sure they have the best equipment possible   Senator Clinton said            For several years  I have heard reports from active duty troops and military experts that Dragon Skin body armor is more effective than that currently being used   said Senator Webb    We owe it to those who are in harm s way to examine conclusively whether this is true           Recent media reports suggest that the Pinnacle Dragon Skin Body Armor system may offer better protection than Interceptor Body Armor currently being used by our servicemembers   In light of these revelations   along with constituent concerns expressed to the Senators describing servicemembers and government personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan wearing alternative body armor systems because of concerns about inadequate body armor currently being issued to service members   the Senators requested that the scope of the GAO review include           1  A comparison and testing of the Interceptor Body Armor system with other commercially available products including the Pinnacle Dragon Skin Body Armor system and the Special Operations Forces Equipment Advanced Requirements  SPEAR  to determine if troops are currently issued the best available body armor system          2  A determination of the necessary procurement steps required to obtain and field the best body armor systems for the armed forces          3  A review to confirm compliance and applicability of current body armor system policies and Safety of Use Messages for wear that apply to conventional forces and special operations forces in Iraq and Afghanistan            The full text of the Senators  letter to the Comptroller General follows          May 18  2007      The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street   N W   Washington  D C  20548      Dear Mr  Walker       We are writing to request that the Government Accountability Office conduct an investigation that would reassess body armor systems currently being issued by all the military services and the Special Operations Command for effectiveness and reliability against the threats facing our troops in combat          Recent media reports suggest that the Pinnacle Dragon Skin Body Armor system may offer better protection than Interceptor Body Armor currently being used by our service members   Additionally  we have received constituent inquiries describing service members and government personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan wearing alternative body armor systems because of concerns about performance shortcomings with body armor procured by the Department of Defense           We owe it to our men and women in uniform serving in Iraq  Afghanistan  and other hazardous regions to provide them with the best possible body armor   Continuing allegations that superior body armor may be available but is not being acquired by the Department of Defense warrant an independent assessment            In light of these revelations and constituent concerns we request that the Government Accountability Office reassess the various body armor systems currently being employed by all branches of the armed forces and the Special Operations Command for effectiveness and reliability against the threats facing our troops in combat   The scope of this review should include   1  a comparison and testing of the Interceptor Body Armor system with other commercially available products including the Pinnacle Dragon Skin Body Armor system and the Special Operations Forces Equipment Advanced Requirements  SPEAR  to determine if our troops are currently issued the best available body armor system   2  a determination of the necessary procurement steps required to obtain and field the best body armor systems for the armed forces  and  3  a review to confirm compliance and applicability of current body armor system policies and Safety of Use Messages for wear that apply to conventional forces and special operations forces in Iraq and Afghanistan            We look forward to your prompt response   Thank you for your consideration          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton  James Webb    CC
