                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Clinton  Bush Veto of Budget Compromise Endangers  109 Million from Critical Health Programs for Victims of 9 11 Attacks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President Bush to rescind his threat to veto a budget  which provides  109 million in critical funding to healthcare programs to treat those who are now suffering from illnesses as a result of the 9 11 attacks  In a letter to the President  Senator Clinton stated that under the restraints of the Presidents budget request the funding for these vital programs would be lost  Senator Clinton called on the President to remember the first responders he stood with in the days following the terrorist attacks  many of whom now suffer from debilitating illnesses  and urged him not to abandon them in this crucial time of need     In the aftermath the September 11 attacks our first responders and countless others reacted without concern for their own lives and safety  and many now suffer from debilitating illnesses as a direct result  They did not ask whether someday they would become sick  or how they would afford the care  they simply chose to act  said Senator Clinton  Congress has worked hard to put forward a plan that contains the funding necessary for these critically important 9 11 health programs  I strongly urge the President to abandon his veto threat  and to work with Congress for the common good to ensure that these vital programs receive the funding they desperately need    Senator Clinton has long stood shoulder to shoulder with the first responders and other victims of the September 11  2001 attacks upon the World Trade Center  in fighting for the critical funding needed to address the short and long term health needs of those individuals who were exposed to the environmental hazards released as a result of the tragic events of that day  More than six years after the attacks  persistent health effects have been documented among residents  rescue and recovery workers  such as asthma  chronic sinusitis  and gastrointestinal conditions  Post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD   anxiety  depression  and other health effects have also been diagnosed among many of those that have been exposed      The letter to President Bush is attached    December 11  2007   The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    Congress is entering the final stages of the Fiscal Year 2008 Appropriations cycle   While there are a number of critical programs that need funds in the next fiscal year  I want to take this opportunity to focus your attention on 9 11 health programs   Over six years ago  you stood with first responders  many of whom now suffer debilitating illnesses as a result of their exposure to the toxic stew from the 9 11 attacks at the World Trade Center  WTC   and thanked them for their efforts  You noted that we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice  Yet  should you veto the compromise plan put forward by Congress  these valiant responders will be abandoned in their hour of need       The compromise plan proposed by Congress contains critical funding for the monitoring and treatment of individuals who became sick as a result of the 9 11 terrorist attacks in New York   The  109 million included in this plan would provide the funds necessary for these critically important 9 11 health programs to continue to provide uninterrupted services throughout the year   However  under your budget request this funding would be lost      Those who responded heroically without regard to their own health to one of this countrys greatest tragedies deserve our unwavering gratitude and support   We have a moral obligation to take care of their 9 11 health related illnesses   It is our national responsibility to care for those who did our country proud in the hours  days  weeks or months following that horrific attack   Congress has carefully put together a plan that provides resources to critical programs that desperately need funding   This is the time when we need our President and Congress to reach an agreement for the common good   I urge you to immediately abandon your veto threat and work with Congress to provide the funding needed for 9 11 health programs and for our nation     I look forward to receiving your response     Sincerely    Hillary Rodham Clinton
