June 6  2007 Clinton Welcomes Department of Transportation Order to Prevent CommutAir From Stopping Service Before Another Carrier is Found                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed the issuance of an order today by the Department of Transportation  DOT  to prevent the termination of essential air service by CommutAir at Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake Lake Placid Airports until another carrier is identified to service the routes  I am very pleased that the Department of Transportation has issued this order which means that CommutAir cannot leave Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake Lake Placid Airports until another carrier has been secured for these critical routes  CommutAirs termination of service at Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake Lake Placid would leave the communities without any scheduled commercial passenger service and that is simply unacceptable under any circumstances  I am pleased that the DOT heard the very real concerns of the community about the need for regular and reliable service and I will continue to work with the community and with the DOT to ensure that they have frequent flights with a reliable carrier  Senator Clinton said  The order released by the Department today prohibits Champlain Enterprises  Inc    CommutAir   from terminating its subsidized essential air service  EAS  at Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake Lake Placid at the end of its 90 day notice period  The order also requests long term proposals from carriers interested in providing EAS at all three communities  for a new two year period  with or without subsidy  Under the order  carriers are required to file their proposals no later than July11 2007
