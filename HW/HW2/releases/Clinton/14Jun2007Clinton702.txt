June 14  2007 Senator Clinton Sets Priorities for Farm Bill Reauthorization                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senate Set to Begin Consideration of 2007 Farm Bill   Clinton Says Bill is an Important Opportunity to Support Programs Aimed at Assisting Both Farmers and Consumers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today outlined her priorities for the upcoming reauthorization of the Farm Bill  In a letter to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Harkin  and Ranking Member Saxby Chambliss  Senator Clinton outlined a number of proposals that she believes should be addressed in the Farm Bill and called for the inclusion of several of her own proposals in the anticipated markup  The reauthorization of the Farm Bill provides a unique opportunity for us to look out for our agricultural and rural communities  We have to make sure that we do everything we can to continue the programs that work and fix those that dont  Senator Clinton said today  A chance like this to enhance and improve essential farming programs only comes along once every five years  and I am excited to seize this opportunity to secure the future of our farming families and communities  I look forward to working with the Senate Agricultural Committee to make the best case for our producers  The 2002 Farm Bill  officially entitled the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002  authorizes programs operated by USDA such as the farm price and income support programs and expires with the 2007 crop year  As such  new legislation needs to be enacted prior to the expiration of the 2002 Act at the end of September   In addition to outlining her priorities for existing programs  Senator Clinton also urged the Committee to consider a number of pieces of legislation that she has introduced  as well as others she supports and co sponsored  for policy discussion during the farm bill negotiations and inclusion in the final bill  In her letter  Senator Clinton called on her Senate colleagues to address a number of issues including    Dairy  Senator Clinton urged the Committee to continue the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program as part of a safety net for dairy farmers and called for enhancements to the program  Country of Origin Labeling  COOL   Senator Clinton called for action to force the USDA to properly implement COOL  The Senator also called for oversight hearings to ensure that the true letter of the law is expressed in its final implementation   Commodities  Senator Clinton emphasized the need to continue the commodity title with a strong counter cyclical safety net  factoring cost of production  for producers to mitigate periods of low prices   Credit  Crop Insurance  Senator Clinton called on her colleagues to address the serious lack of credit opportunities that is making it almost impossible in some cases for coming generations to make a career in agriculture  Food Safety  Senator Clinton urged the Committee to consider language to push the USDA and the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  into implementing better programs to protect our food supply  including the possibilities of increased food inspectors and a reorganization of the food safety structure between agencies  Nutrition Senator Clinton called for Congress to strengthen and enforce USDAs purchasing of local products in many of the departments feeding and nutritional programs  Senator Clinton is a lead sponsor with Senator Brown of the Food Outreach and Opportunity Development  FOOD  for a Healthy America Act  to expand the access to healthy food and increase markets for producers and has also introduced the School Food Fresh Act which would better connect schools with more fresh foods produced by local farmers  She also called for an expansion of efforts to help lower income Americans whose well being depends upon access to our federal nutrition programs   Conservation  Senator Clinton called for a restoration and full funding of the Conservation Security Program  CSP  and Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP  while recommending additional enhancements to the whole Conservation title  She also asked the Committee to consider ways to encourage farmers to get more involved in agricultural practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions  Specialty Crops  Senator Clinton called for the inclusion of language aimed at strengthening the Value Added Grant Program  the Foreign Market Access program  and efforts to stem the tide of invasive species that are threatening many producers Senator Clinton is a co sponsor of the Specialty Crops Competition Act  which would enhance programs to help specialty crop farmers  The most important piece from that legislation is ensuring the expansion of the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program  Honeybee Crisis Senator Clinton urged her colleagues to take steps to stop Colony Collapse Disorder which is impacting producers of honey  apples and many other crops   Energy  Senator Clinton urged the Committee to continue the innovative programs that were authorized in the 2002 Farm Bill to help farmers produce energy and to look for new incentives to plant new energy crops and promote local ownership of renewable energy production projects  Rural Development Senator Clinton committed to working with the Committee to promote a rural development framework to help rural communities and businesses to compete in a in a globalizing economy  including increased investment and a coordinated approach to rural innovation  investment  and regional collaboration  The Senator introduced the Rural Investment to Strengthen our Economy Act  Rural RISE Act  to increase credit access for rural entrepreneurs and microenterprises  Broadband  Senator Clinton introduced the Rural Broadband Initiative Act which would authorize  20 million in annual funding  and would create a new undersecretary position at the USDA whose primary responsibility is getting broadband technology to all corners of rural America  The Senator is asking for consideration of this legislation as part of the Rural Development title   A copy of Senator Clintons letter is below    June 14  2007  The Honorable Tom Harkin  Chairman  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry United   States Senate  SR 328  Washington  D C  20510 The Honorable Saxby Chambliss  Ranking Member  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  United   States Senate  SR 328 Washington  D C  20510   Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Chambliss  As you work to develop a new farm bill  I write to ask for your consideration of a number of proposals and ideas that I believe can help both producers and consumers   Nutrition  Senator Brown and I have introduced S 1432  the Food Outreach and Opportunity Development  FOOD  for a Healthy America Act  an effort to expand access to healthy food for consumers and increase markets for our producers  This legislation seeks to strengthen existing nutrition programs  such as the Seniors Farmers Market Nutrition Program  the Farm to Cafeteria Program and national expansion of the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program  I have also introduced the School Food Fresh Act  S  1031  which would better connect schools with more fresh foods produced by local farmers  In addition to these programs  we should strengthen and enforce the United States Department of Agricultures  USDA  purchasing of local products in many of the departments feeding and nutritional programs   Beyond improving access to quality food  we also need to expand our efforts to help lower income Americans whose well being depends upon access to our federal nutrition programs  The proposals that you have offered with Senator Lugar  in the Food Stamp Fairness and Benefit Restoration Act  are important steps toward this goal  Your legislation works to end food stamp benefit erosion and update asset reform  These are examples of the kind of enhancements we need to respond to the years of cuts and deductions these programs have experienced   Conservation  Conservation programs are critically important to farmers in New York and across the country  Restoring funding for the Conservation Security Program  CSP  is a priority that I know you are working toward  As I have met with and listened to New   York farmers  I have heard a number of other recommendations that I would like to bring to your attention  Enhance the Farm and Ranch Land Preservation Program to allow for proper utilization in New York and all states  Increase the funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP  which better targets funding to increase environmental benefits  expanding it to support the implementation of alternative manure utilization or treatment technologies and conversion to organic agriculture  Expand eligibility of the Conservation Security Program  CSP  so that all producers can participate in the program  and provide additional resources for technical assistance through the Natural Resources Conservation Service  NRCS   In addition to strengthening existing conservation programs  I hope that you consider ways to encourage farmers to get more involved in agricultural practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions  Voluntary carbon trading markets are beginning to provide a way to improve farm income  and I urge you to consider research  technical assistance and other ways that the farm bill can help producers become more involved in these opportunities to help the environment and their bottom line  These steps we can make conservation programs even more valuable and accessible to farmers in New York and across America   Specialty Crops Specialty crops play a vital role in our domestic food supply and nutrition  and we need to do more to help producers  I am a cosponsor of Senator Stabenows Specialty Crops Competition Act legislation that would enhance programs to help specialty crop farmers in New York and across the country produce and market their crops  Specifically  I would encourage the inclusion of language aimed at strengthening and improving the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program  the Value Added Grant Program  the Foreign Market Access program and efforts to stem the tide of invasive species that are threatening many producers   Also  I urge you to take steps to reduce the loss of our vital pollinators to Colony Collapse Disorder  CCD   which is impacting producers of honey  apples and many other crops  CCD is currently raising the cost of producing these crops  The potential negative impacts on produce quality and quantity for the future is alarming  With these concerns in mind  I reiterate the request that I made in a prior letter to your committee to include research and other provisions to address this growing problem  For that purpose  I support legislation from Senator Baucus  on conservation policy  and Senator Boxers upcoming bill on research priorities to reduce these rapid pollinator losses  Dairy  New York is the third leading state in the production of milk and its producers need a fair dairy safety net that takes into account increases of feed and energy costs  A payment program based on a counter cyclical approach aids producers in times of lower prices and is less costly to taxpayers in times of high prices  The Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program has worked well as part of a safety net to dairymen during times of low milk prices and has provided much needed assistance to producers  As you consider reauthorization of this program  I ask you to look at improvements  such as restoring payments to 45  of the difference between the target and market prices and doubling the limit on payments from 2 4 million pounds of milk to 4 8 million pounds to provide for more hard working milk producers  Commodities  Like dairy  the commodity title needs to have a strong safety net for producers  A counter cyclical program  factoring cost of production  is the most effective way to help farmers when prices are low and to save taxpayer dollars when our farmers are getting a better price from the market  Farmers in this country need a reliable and fiscally sound set of payments that help mitigate the impact of their being price takers and not price makers  This requires federal support in times of fluctuating prices  Energy  Energy production has led to expanding opportunities for our rural Americans  The last farm bill included a number of innovative programs to help farmers and ranchers produce energy  and I urge you to reauthorize and expand these programs  Looking forward  cellulosic ethanol holds great promise for all regions of the country  and the new farm bill offers a great opportunity for research and programs to provide incentives for producers to plant new energy crops  I have supported various bills to address these and other renewable energy and biofuel concepts  In addition  as we continue to develop rural  renewable energy production  I ask that you consider ways to promote local ownership of biorefineries  wind farms and other renewable energy projects  Studies show that the inclusion of local ownership of renewable energy spurs economic activity within small communities and the next farm bill can further encourage this kind of rural investment   Credit  Crop Insurance  As the committee is well aware  it is becoming more and more difficult for young people to get started in farming and ranching or to invest in improving the operations they already have  Lack of access to capital and credit opportunities is making it almost impossible in some cases for our next generation of farmers to make a career in agriculture  It is essential that we make it easier to overcome these hurdles   I have received a number of suggestions from producers in my state regarding crop insurance and would like to offer these as program improvements  reducing the loss threshold for claims  allowing a higher subsidy rate for higher coverage levels  speeding up the certification and approval process for adding crops or new states to allow greater coverage  and supporting pilot programs for application to the diary industry  The McGovern Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program  The reauthorization of the McGovern Dole feeding program is legislation that I have been pleased to co sponsor  This program is a very positive initiative that not only decreases childhood hunger around the world but also improves childrens education and health on a daily basis  Food Safety  Given the recent problems surrounding the food supply of not just our pets but of food for human consumption as well  I would ask that you include measures to strengthen our food safety programs  There needs to be a full debate on issues relating to food safety in this country  Consideration of increasing inspectors and efforts to restructure our current system should be discussed during these times of increased imports and food borne illness scares  Country of Origin Labeling  COOL  is one tool that gives consumers and food safety officials better information in times of necessity  and in the everyday decisions that consumers make when purchasing food to feed their families  Even though COOL was passed in the 2002 Farm Bill  the implementation of this program for products  other than seafood  has yet to occur  I hope to see an emphasis on language to mitigate USDAs inability to implement this program properly and that oversight hearings can occur to ensure that the true letter of the law is expressed in its final implementation  I urge mandatory implementation of this program as soon as possible  Rural Development  In addition to strengthening farm programs  we need a bold and visionary new rural development framework to help rural communities and businesses to compete in a globalizing economy  As you know  over the past 15 years  federal investments through USDA Rural Development have essentially remained flat  Our global competitors are doing the opposite  in fact  each year the European Union  EU  is investing over 2 billion euros in rural development commitments  In addition to increasing investment  I think we need to move to a more systemic approach to rural innovation  investment and regional collaboration  I have outlined such an approach by introducing S  1034  The Rural Investment to Strengthen our Economy Act  The Rural RISE Act   This legislation builds on proposals that were put forward in the last farm bill including increased credit access for rural entrepreneurs and microenterprises  a revised Rural Strategic Investment Program and incentives for home ownership in rural areas  Broadband  Getting broadband to rural areas is a critical economic development priority  I have introduced S  1032  The Rural Broadband Initiative Act  to accelerate this expansion  The bill would authorize  20 million in annual innovation funding  and would create a new undersecretary position at the USDA whose primary responsibility is getting broadband technology to all corners of rural America  Accountability is key to this expansion and I have stressed these qualities in my legislation  I strongly believe that these farm bill and rural issue recommendations would benefit New York and the entire country  Although I understand the current budget restraints  I ask your careful consideration of these proposals as you continue to develop the farm bill  I look forward to working with you on passage of a Senate farm bill later this year   Sincerely yours   Hillary Rodham Clinton
