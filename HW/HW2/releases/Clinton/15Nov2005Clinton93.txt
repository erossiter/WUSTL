November 15  2005 Bishop  Schumer  Clinton Call for Meeting with U S  Department of Energy Over Cuts to Brookhaven Lab                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Delegation says they will work with DOE on a solution that keeps Brookhaven funded at acceptable levels                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  In further reaction to news of devastating cuts to funding for the Brookhaven National Laboratory  BNL   Congressman Tim Bishop and Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton are calling on the U S  Department of Energy to meet with their offices as soon as possible to work out a solution  In a letter to Raymond L  Orbach  Ph D   Director of Science at the United States Department of Energy  Bishop  Schumer and Clinton blasted the cuts  which will have a major negative impact on the Brookhaven Lab and called for a meeting to discuss possible alternative funding options      The Conference Report of the Energy and Water Resources Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2006  which was approved in the House last week and in the Senate yesterday  contains drastic cuts to two major programs  the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  and the Center for Translational Neuroimaging   Bishop restored funding when the bill passed the House in May and Senators Schumer and Clinton restored funding when the bill passed the Senate in July   However  the funding was cut in Conference Committee  down to numbers originally proposed by President Bush in his budget in January            The decision to cut funding for the RHIC goes against the interests of science and most importantly  the public interest     Congressman Bishop said    Although Senators Schumer and Clinton and I have been fighting to restore funding for this vital program  the President s wishes ultimately prevailed  We are taking our case directly to the Office of Sciences to restore this funding  and we look forward to a meeting as soon as possible             BNL is a unique national treasure that is used by academic and industry partners up and down the East Coast and is one of the nation s foremost scientific research centers  At a time of increased international competition in the sciences  when America s lead in the 21st century will be maintained by our lead in information and knowledge based industries  cutting this funding is not only bad for New York but extremely shortsighted and threatens the future economic growth of our nation     said Senator Schumer          There can be no two ways about it    we must provide enough funding for Brookhaven Lab to continue their important work  We cannot shortchange this world class facility without consequences     said Senator Clinton    Congressman Bishop  Senator Schumer and I have been fighting to restore this funding since it was cut in the President  s Budget and now we have no choice but to take our fight directly to the Administration  I look forward to hearing from the Department of Energy on a possible meeting so that we can come to an acceptable solution          The RHIC is a world renowned 2 4 mile superconductor that accelerates gold ions to nearly the speed of light and causes collisions that recreate the  Big Bang   offering a glimpse into the birth of the universe during its first few microseconds  Its budget was cut by approximately  13 million  from its overall budget of approximately  131 million   The cut  combined with increased energy costs  may result in the RHIC being used as little as five weeks over the next year      The Center for Translational Neuroimaging  which conducts basic clinical research with a strong focus on drug addiction and obesity  had its  5 1 million budget slashed by nearly  2 million         A copy of the letter to the Department of Energy is attached        November 14  2005       Raymond L  Orbach  Ph D   Director of Science  United States Department of Energy  1000 Independence Avenue   S W   Washington  D C   20585       Dear Dr  Orbach        The Department of Energy  s FY 2006 budget request to Congress included only  370 7 million for Nuclear Physics programs which will have a negative effect on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  at Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York   Because of the poorly funded budget requests  we supported additional funding for the Nuclear Physics program in the FY 2006 Energy   Water Appropriations bill   Additional funding would augment operations at RHIC compensating for a shortfall contained in the President  s budget   The Senate provided  419 7 million for nuclear physics  an increase of  49 million over the President  s budget and provided that this additional funding would   ensure full utilization of experimental facilities      Additionally  the House of Representatives provided  408 3 billion for nuclear physics  an increase of  37 6 million above the President s budget with specific language to restore operating time for the RHIC        Unfortunately  the Energy and Water Appropriations conference report failed to retain this additional funding which is particularly troubling given the rise in power costs that have increased nearly 40 percent since the beginning of 2005   The consequences of this funding level mean the amount available in fiscal year 2006 will reduce RHIC operations from 31 weeks to only 5 6 weeks         RHIC is a vital  world class nuclear physics facility and serves 1 000 users and more than 200 students at the undergraduate  masters  and doctoral levels   The research derived from RHIC trains present and future generations of scientists   The funding levels contained in this bill will paralyze ongoing research which does not make sense given that over  1 billion has been invested to date  including about  600 million to construct the facility   This is an unacceptable disinvestment of federal spending and we would like to work with the Department on an amicable resolution         We request that you meet with our legislative staff members to determine the Department  s ability to re allocate funds so that an additional  20 million can be slated for RHIC operations in FY 2006   Brookhaven Lab is vitally important not only to New York  but also to national physics research programs   We are committed to ensuring Brookhaven  s long term availability to physics researchers and we would like to know if you or the Department require additional flexibility and authority to reprogram funds to address the inadequate funding   Please contact us at your earliest convenience to schedule a meeting   We look forward to working with you to resolve the RHIC funding situation        Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton    Charles E  Schumer         Tim Bishop
