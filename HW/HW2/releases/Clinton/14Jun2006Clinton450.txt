June 14  2006 Senator Clinton  Democratic Colleagues Call on Administration to Do More on Theft of Veterans and Active Duty Soldiers   Personal Data                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senators call on GAO to Investigate Major Discrepancies in Information Provided by Department of Veterans   Affairs      Introduce legislation to prevent further breaches                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined with her Democratic colleagues to call on the Administration to take major action following the theft of veterans   and servicemembers   personal data  At a press conference  the Senators accused the Administration of carelessness and incompetence in dealing with the public on the true nature of the problem and charged that the Department has acted too slowly to address the serious issues involved with the data theft            As a nation  we were all deeply concerned when we learned of this Veteran  s Affairs data theft incident  26 5 million veterans had their personal data stolen and their privacy compromised   Now we learn that millions of currently serving members of our Nation  s Armed Forces were included in this security breach as well     Senator Clinton said    Our veterans served our nation and deserve better than to have their private information treated so carelessly    And the American men and women serving so selflessly today need less to worry about  not more             In a letter to the U S  Comptroller General  the Senators urged him to conduct an in depth Government Accountability Office study to get the facts on this breach and to address the vulnerabilities that led to it  The Senators also announced they were introducing legislation sponsored by Senator Akaka  to address the unauthorized removal or use of personal information maintained in Federal databases   The legislation would compliment existing law and provide another tool for the protection of health information              This Administration  s incompetence has now gone digital    and the men and women who serve our country  and their families  are the ones who will pay the price     Senator Clinton said     We owe it to our men and women in uniform to protect their privacy   We need to get to the bottom of this and prevent it from happening again               Soldiers serving in harms way should not bear the additional burden of worrying about identity theft   And we should not place still more pressure on the families back home in dealing with the ripple effects of potential or actual identity theft     Senator Clinton said          The   Data Theft Protection Act of 2006     would establish Federal penalties for anyone who knowingly and without authorization views  uses  downloads or removes any means of identification or individually identifiable health information that is in a Federal database   It would also make illegal the transfer of such information to any computer  network  database or other format used to store information that is not a Federal database   It establishes Federal penalties for any person who uses a means of identification or individually identifiable health information obtained directly or indirectly from a Federal database in furtherance of a violation of a Federal or State criminal law   The bill is designed to serve as deterrent to prevent future breaches of personal information from Federal databases           A copy of the Senators   letter is attached          June 14  2006  Mr  David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  NW  Washington  DC 20548      Dear Mr  Walker       Last week  several major newspapers reported that the personal information of 80  of our active military personnel was included in the May 3rd heist of a personal computer belonging to a Department of Veterans Affairs employee   According to the VA  the information contained the names  Social Security Numbers  and birthdates of 2 2 million military personnel 1    A spokesman from the department said 1 1 million active duty personnel  430 000 National Guard members  and 645 000 Reservists were among the 26 5 million identities stolen from the laptop computer            These recent revelations directly contradict the Department of Veterans Affairs initial response to the massive data breach that occurred in early May  The New York Times reported that the May 22nd announcement included the larceny   of up to 26 5 million veterans  and their spouses     2  Yet  at no time were any active military personnel  or members of Congress  aware that the personal security of the bulk of our military apparatus was jeopardized           Given this new revelation and the continued failure of the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide accurate  timely and complete information to the American people or the Congress  we are writing to request the Government Accountability Office further investigate this matter           This security breach not only threatens the identity and financial security of millions of veterans and active military personnel  but also the safety and security of our troops and their families   Security experts have suggested that the data theft may have profound consequences on the safety of our troops      There is a global black market in this sort of information    and you suddenly have a treasure trove of information on the U S  military that is available    said James Lewis  director of technology and public policy at CSIS     3           Unfortunately  this new disclosure by the VA is just the latest example in a long record of incompetence and deception within the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Bush administration            The Department of Veterans Affairs has shown a pattern of careless  and possibly even deceitful  communication  both within the department itself and to the Congress and the public at large with respect to this data loss  Secretary Nicholson was not informed about the data theft until 13 days after the burglary  When Senator Susan Collins asked him how it was possible he was not informed immediately  he replied that it was unclear  4   Additionally  officials in the department did not report the May 3rd data theft until over two weeks later on May 22nd  leaving millions of veterans unknowingly at high risk of identity theft   Also  when the department learned that the personal information of active military personnel was compromised  Secretary Nicholson badly underestimated the number of troops put in harms way   His estimation of 50 000 Navy and National Guard members affected accounted for just a tiny fraction of the total number of American troops exposed  5          The information security breach is even more egregious considering VA  after continual security audits  was well aware of the vulnerability of its data security  According to VA Inspector General George Opfer    In all four audits of the VA Security Program issued since 2001  we reported serious vulnerabilities that remain uncorrected  These reports highlight specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited  but the recurring themes in these reports are the need for centralization  remediation  and accountability in VA information security  Since the FY 2001 report  we reported weakness in physical security  electronic security  wireless security  personnel security  and FISMA reporting     6          For all these reasons  we ask that the Government Accountability Office make an in depth inquiry into the causes of this serious breach  the adequacy of the VA  s response  and the impact to the veterans and military community at large   More specifically  we desire that the GAO               Provide a full and complete assessment of the security breach  affected personnel and the impact of this incident             Review and evaluate the impact of the delay by VA officials to analyze the contents of the stolen data and further assess its content              Review the adequacy of VA  s response to recommendations by GAO and the VA Inspector General to make VA compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act   Please describe in detail VA  s implementation efforts or responses in this regard             Identify any needed legislative solutions that would address requirements for notifying citizens in a timely manner of breaches or losses of personal information from Federal databases           Review VA  s response  and the adequacy of that response  to strengthen personal information security management               Review the adequacy of existing laws  such as the Privacy Act  to protect personal information contained with Federal electronic databases and provide recommendations on how these laws might strengthen in light of current vulnerabilities and the state of technology             Review and evaluate the impact of the data theft on the veterans   community  active  guard and reserve members and what efforts are being undertaken by VA to ensure that the stolen personal information is not misused  whether those steps are adequate  what additional measures might be necessary to protect those whose information was lost  and finally  how to deal with any harm caused to those individuals from this breach          We look forward to working with you regarding this most important matter          Sincerely
