March 12  2007 Clinton Applauds EPA Decision on Newton Falls Fine Paper                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today applauded a U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  decision that removes a major obstacle to efforts to restart the paper mill in Newton Falls  NY   The decision follows a phone call from Senator Clinton to EPA Regional Administrator Alan Steinberg last Tuesday  and a December 2006 letter from Senator Clinton and Congressman McHugh             This is a big step towards getting the paper mill up and running and putting people back to work in Newton Falls   said Senator Clinton    I am glad that EPA made the right decision  and I look forward to continuing to work with Newton Falls Fine Paper to help keep this project moving along           The EPA decision today eliminates the possibility that a lengthy and costly review process would be required   Company officials had indicated that the requirement of such a review would likely put a stop to their bid to restart the paper mill  which has been closed since 2000   After hearing from local elected officials and community leaders  Senator Clinton initially wrote to EPA Regional Administrator Steinberg in December of 2006   She followed up with a phone call to Mr  Steinberg last Tuesday  and today received word of EPA s decision by phone from Mr  Steinberg            The text of the December 6  2006 letter appears below          December 6  2006      Mr  Alan J  Steinberg  Regional Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  290 Broadway Avenue  New York  NY 10007 1866      Dear Regional Administrator Steinberg       We write to you in regards to an important decision pending in your office    You have been asked by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation  DEC  to make a determination as to whether the restart of a paper mill in Newton Falls  New York would require a full Prevention of Significant Deterioration  PSD  review   The review pertains to a permit issued under Title V of the Clean Air Act that is due to expire on August 4  2009          Newton Falls Fine Paper Company plans to restart the mill  a move that would immediately create 97 high paying jobs and offer the promise of future job growth   Restarting the mill is critical to reversing an alarming downward economic spiral and de population of the Western Adirondack and Southern St  Lawrence County regions in Northern New York   The mill would also bolster the local school system  help to retain the regional hospital and provide economic life to many small business owners          We support strong enforcement of the Clean Air Act to protect public health and the environment   We also believe that the decision about whether to require a full PSD review should consider the circumstances at the mill  whose representatives have informed us that the facility has been maintained consistently since it closed in 2000 with an eye towards being able to restart the mill quickly and in compliance with the law            We strongly urge you to consider the economic importance of the mill to New York  and to move swiftly to provide an indication about whether a full PSD review will be required   It is our understanding that the owners of the mill have decided to sell the facility by year end  and that a failure to resolve the PSD decision in the coming weeks may force a permanent closure          We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your reply            Sincerely
