September 5  2007 Clinton  Nadler and Maloney  New GAO Report Confirms Serious Problems with EPA WTC Indoor  Test and Clean  Program and Preparedness for Future Disasters                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Independent Analysis Also Reveals that EPA Technical Experts Rejected the Program and that the Agency Misled the Public Regarding Prior Post 9 11 Clean Up                Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Clinton  NY   Congressman Jerrold Nadler  NY 08   and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney  NY 14  today unveiled a newly released Government Accountability Office  GAO  report that details serious flaws in the Environmental Protection Agencys  EPA  second program seeking to address the indoor contamination resulting from the September 11  2001  attacks on the World Trade Center  as well as the Agencys ability to deal with future disasters involving indoor environmental impacts   The GAO is the non partisan investigative arm of Congress charged with auditing and evaluating Government programs and activities    The report also found that the EPA ignored the advice of its own technical experts    members of the EPA World Trade Center Technical Review Panel    in the development of the plan  and that 16 out of 18 of the panel members did not endorse the plan   As such  a majority of the panel members now believe that the EPAs process was unsuccessful at identifying unmet public health needs  and characterizing any remaining  environmental  risks  or responding to the concerns of residents and workers affected by the disaster   Further  the independent analysis concluded that EPAs early inaction led to its total failure  to date  to properly characterize the extent of the WTC contamination and that the EPA officials misled the public when they mischaracterized the results of earlier asbestos testing    The subject of the GAOs report is the EPAs second post 9 11 indoor cleanup program  called Test and Clean  which was announced in December of 2005 and is currently underway   The EPAs first post 9 11 testing and clean up program was conducted in 2002 and 2003 and involved fewer than 4 200 of over 20 000 lower Manhattan residences  and none of the over 330 commercial and public buildings below Canal Street   That first program was forcefully criticized by EPAs own Inspector General  IG  for  among other things  its voluntary nature  failure to meet the minimum legal criteria for protecting human health  use of sub par testing equipment and non aggressive methodologies  tests limited to only one of the many contaminants of concern  asbestos   use of arbitrary geographic boundaries that excluded areas such as Brooklyn and lower Manhattan above Canal Street  and for excluding workplaces  In response to the IG report and to the serious air quality concerns raised by Senator Clinton and Representative Nadler  the EPA convened the World Trade Center Technical Review Panel in March 2004 to ostensibly address these failures by developing a second plan            The report found that the EPAs second program fails to include many of the recommendations made by the EPA IG and or the panel members themselves  including 1  no extension of the geographic boundaries to include Brooklyn and lower Manhattan above Canal Street  2  no inclusion of workspaces  3  a continued failure to use health based benchmarks  4  failure to treat buildings as a whole by testing HVAC systems  and 5  failure to test or clean in hard to reach areas  such as under beds or behind refrigerators      EPAs approach to funding the program is itself a serious flaw  the GAO found  as the plan was designed not around a comprehensive cost estimate  but around a cap of the remaining  7 million from the previous program   And finally  the report notes that the second plan completely fails on arguably the most important recommendation from the IG  to develop an approach to determine or characterize the actual extent of the World Trade Center contamination in the New York metro area  Looking forward  the report also warns that the EPA is not prepared to respond to future disasters that have an indoor contamination component because  among other things  the EPA has still not developed protocols on how and when to collect data to determine the extent of indoor contamination    Todays GAO report confirms the Bush Administrations incompetence and indifference to the health threat posed by indoor contamination from the toxic cloud that filled the air in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks  The EPA and the Bush Administration ignored the advice of scientific experts  dragged their heels  and failed to produce a real program to test for and clean up toxic World Trade Center dust in peoples homes and offices  Where the Bush Administration and EPA have failed  we must do everything we can to succeed  We need a new clean up program from the EPA and a renewed commitment to be better prepared for future disasters  said Senator Clinton           For six years  we have demanded that the EPA fulfill its legal mandate to protect public health by telling the truth about post 9 11 air quality and by implementing a scientifically sound testing and cleaning program to address indoor contamination   It has absolutely failed on both fronts  said Congressman Nadler  The GAO report confirms the horrible reality that to this day  due to their negligence and inaction  the EPA cannot say with certainty that even a single building in the area is free of World Trade Center contamination   As such  we cannot know how many more people will become sick because of lingering environmental toxins in their homes  workplaces and schools   The Administration must act immediately to design and implement a new  proper testing and cleaning program and fully fund long term  comprehensive health care for those who are  and will become  sick    The EPAs two test and clean programs bear the hallmarks of this Administration  incompetence and failure to learn from mistakes  said Congresswoman Maloney   I thank Senator Clinton and Congressman Nadler for keeping the pressure on the EPA to do its job and protect those who live  work or go to school downtown    In testimony before a June Senate hearing chaired by Senator Clinton  the GAO announced preliminary report findings concluding that EPA did not fully inform the public about the results of the first testing and cleaning program  stating that more complete information would have allowed the public to make informed choices about participation in its most recent voluntary program   Notably  the GAO found that EPA mischaracterized the asbestos testing results from the first program  when EPA officials publicly reported that a very small number of samples exceeded risk levels   The GAO said EPA did not tell the public that over 80 percent of the samples were taken after the residences were professionally cleaned   The report further noted that given that only 20 percent of eligible residences were tested  the results may not have been fully representative  as the sample size was too small    The GAO report makes several recommendations for the EPA  namely  that it should communicate risks to the public by presenting environmental data in a clear and appropriate context  create guidelines for estimating program costs  and swiftly develop protocols that specifically address indoor contamination   GAO notes that if the EPA continues to fail in its responsibility  important public health needs  including resident and worker health  may not be promptly addressed    The report was prepared by the GAO at the request of Senator Clinton and Reps  Nadler and Maloney  and is entitled World Trade Center  EPAs Most Recent Test and Clean Program Raises Concerns that Need to be Addressed to Better Prepare for Indoor Contamination Following Disasters  and is available at http   clinton senate gov documents news GAO_WTC
