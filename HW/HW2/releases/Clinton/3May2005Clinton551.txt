May 3  2005 Senator Clinton Underscores Need to Keep   Open Manhattan   Brooklyn VA Hospitals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                New York  NY    Echoing her long standing opposition to closing either the Manhattan or Brooklyn VA hospitals  Senator Clinton today stressed the need to keep open both facilities in testimony to the Local Advisory Panel of the Department of Veterans Affairs  Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  project  Senator Clinton in her testimony emphasized that each hospital plays a unique role in their respective communities and a wholesale transfer of all inpatient services to either facility would change dramatically the way medical care is delivered to veterans in the New York City metropolitan area        Senator Clinton made clear that any proposed plan to consolidate delivery of VA healthcare services must take into account the unique relationship between the New York University School of Medicine and the Manhattan VA hospital  The partnership between the institutions has made the Manhattan VA hospital a model of high quality care  with six tertiary care specialties designated by the VA as centers of excellence  Consolidating inpatient services at the Brooklyn facility would imperil this relationship at the expense of New York s veterans         Senator Clinton also reinforced that the CARES process must take into account the practical matter of transportation in its deliberations  The high quality services at the Manhattan VA hospital attract veterans from the City of New York as well as surrounding areas and other states  One of the main reasons that the Manhattan VA is able to serve these veterans is its remarkable accessibility  located in the heart of Manhattan at the center of a mass transit system that is unmatched anywhere in the world        In addition  Senator Clinton underscored the critical importance of ensuring that VA s planning process for the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals is fully transparent  New York s veterans must be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process        Senator Clinton has fought for New York s veterans throughout the CARES process  Last month  Senator Clinton met with VA Secretary Nicholson to reiterate her serious concerns regarding the VA CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study yet more changes in New York s VA facilities  Secretary Nicholson agreed to consider the points she raised in opposition to the consolidation of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VAs         Throughout her time in the Senate  Senator Clinton has been working hard to protect the interests of New York s veterans    to provide full funding for veterans  health care  to make mandatory the funding of VA health care and to keep New York VA hospitals open               Testimony of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  Before the Local Advisory Panel of the  VA Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced  Services  CARES  Project  As Prepared for Delivery  May 3  2005       Distinguished members of the Panel  let me thank you for allowing me to present testimony on the impact that consolidating the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA campuses would have on the veterans of New York and the people who serve their needs at these institutions  I will address the key elements of my views in these remarks  but I request that my full statement be made a part of the record of this hearing         I strongly oppose closing either the Manhattan or Brooklyn VA hospitals  and thus I also strongly oppose consolidating them  A consolidation would have disastrous consequences for many New York veterans        At this time in our nation s history  with U S  troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose such drastic changes in veterans  health care without proper thought and deliberation        As a starting point  our bottom line goal should be the delivery of high quality health care services to our veterans  delivered as efficiently as possible  With literally the lives of veterans at stake  the panel should not engage in a rush to judgment over closing VA facilities and should not elevate financial considerations over the needs of our veterans        On April 19  I met with VA Secretary Nicholson and handed him a letter in which I reiterated my serious concerns regarding the VA s CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes  and study yet more changes  in New York s VA facilities  He agreed to consider each of the points I raised in opposition to the consolidation of the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA s        I must underline at the outset how absolutely essential it is that during this next phase in the process  the VA s planning process for the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process        There have been several stages to the CARES process  which in my view has been a rushed process that did not adequately heed the voices of New York s veterans  In May 2004  former VA Secretary Anthony Principi s CARES Decision Document issued  directed VA to  undertake a thorough feasibility study of the potential to consolidate the Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses              I have long opposed the potential closure of the Manhattan VA and consolidation with the Brooklyn VA campus  It would be just as ill conceived to close the Brooklyn VA  Each plays a unique role in their respective communities  A wholesale transfer of all inpatient services would result in a dramatic change in the way that medical care is dispensed to veterans in the New York City metropolitan area  This break with current practice would eliminate the possibility of more gradual changes that would consolidate specialty care to meet a changing veterans  population  while refining the specialties of each hospital        Any feasibility study must recognize that the consolidation of inpatient care in Brooklyn will seriously impact the relationship between the New York University School of Medicine and the Manhattan VA  The Manhattan VA contains six tertiary care specialties that the VA has designated as centers of excellence  including Cardiac Surgery  Neurosurgery  and HIV AIDS Care         The New York University School of Medicine  together with its affiliates  the Manhattan VA  Bellevue Hospital  Tisch Hospital  and the Rusk Institute  support an Amputee Center  The Prosthetic Lab has a unique role in the region        According to the New York University School of Medicine  there is about  10 million in joint research at the Manhattan VA  with a substantial amount of the funding provided by the National Institutes of Health         However  according to the NYU School of Medicine  all these endeavors are in jeopardy if the Manhattan campus program moves to Brooklyn        The New York University School of Medicine residency program is fully integrated with the Manhattan VA  Shifting inpatient services from Manhattan to Brooklyn could result in a weakening or termination of that affiliation         The transfer of inpatient services to Brooklyn could also result in the departure of NYU physicians from the New York Harbor Health Care System        The practical matter of transportation is essential to your deliberations  The high quality services at the Manhattan VA attract veterans from the City of New York  as well as surrounding areas and other states  According to figures for Fiscal Year 2004 provided to my office by the New York University School of Medicine  nearly 800 veterans from the Bronx and Queens received inpatient treatment at the Manhattan VA  on top of more than 1 000 veterans from Manhattan  So did more than 300 veterans from the Hudson Valley  Westchester and Long Island  One of the main reasons the Manhattan VA is able to serve these veterans is its remarkable accessibility  located  as it is  in the heart of Manhattan  at the center of a mass transit system that is unmatched anywhere else in the nation        Further  the Manhattan VA can serve to provide vital surge capacity in the event of an emergency         The potential loss of the benefits of the NYU    Manhattan VA relationship as well as the Manhattan VA s central location make the recommendation to study the transfer of inpatient facilities to Brooklyn an ill considered one  Both the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA hospitals should be kept open        In meeting with veterans and hearing the comments that veterans and other stakeholders have provided to my office  I have learned a tremendous amount about the value of these facilities and the quality of health care that is delivered there  Our nation s veterans have served their country with distinction  Our nation made a pact with those who serve their country in the Armed Forces    a commitment that those who served would have access to quality health care through the VA hospital system  Yet the VA s ill considered decision to study the feasibility of consolidating the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA s threatens to undermine our commitment to our nation s veterans  I urge the Panel to take into account the proper factors and input from veterans  I believe that if you listen to the voices of New York s veterans  you will reject proposals for consolidation and will advise the VA to keep open both the Manhattan and Brooklyn VA s        Thank you
