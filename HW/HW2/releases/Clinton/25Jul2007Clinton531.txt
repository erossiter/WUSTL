                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Testimony Emphasizes Need to Improve the Security  Accuracy and Fairness of Federal Elections              Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today testified before the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration on the pressing need for election reform  In her testimony  the Senator emphasized the need for every citizen to be given the opportunity to vote as well as the confidence of knowing that his or her vote is counted     Senator Clinton also highlighted her comprehensive election reform legislation  the Count Every Vote Act  which she and Ohio Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones reintroduced earlier this year   The bill would require a voter verified paper record for every vote cast  improve security measures for electronic voting machines  set a uniform standard for provision ballots  and implement a number of other reforms to improve the federal election process    A transcript of Senator Clintons testimony is below      July 25  2007 Thank you very much Madam Chairman and Ranking Member Bennett  I am delighted to have this opportunity to testify on this issue that goes right to the very heart of our Democracy   the right to vote     I want to commend the Chairman for her dedicated work on this issue  and I am very honored to be a co sponsor of her legislation the Ballot Integrity Act   Under the leadership of the Committee  I hope we can move toward real reform to fix our broken electoral system and restore the integrity of our elections     There are a number of problems that have to be addressed but election reform  it seems to me  is fundamental not only to the sanctity of our democracy but to really restoring confidence in our government   No matter which way the election turns out  people should feel that it was conducted with integrity  that it was executed competently  and that the results can be accepted completely     It really does come down to a basic value that every citizen should have a fair chance to cast a vote and know that his or her vote will count   We have had a long struggle  as Senator Bennett alluded to  opening the circle of opportunity and enfranchisement to all Americans   Certainly when we started back in those early elections that he was referencing  very few Americans were given the franchise   Thankfully  because of the Fourteenth  Fifteenth  and Nineteenth Amendments to our Constitution  and our civil rights legislation  particularly the Voting Rights Act  we have certainly provided a broad circle of opportunity and constitutional rights   But we have not yet removed all of the barriers to voting  and therefore I think you could not be more timely with your concern about this  and with your legislation     As we all know  in the last two presidential elections  we have seen citizens in urban neighborhoods forced to wait in line for five hours or more to cast a ballot  while just down the road voters in suburban neighborhoods would cast their votes in five minutes     Im joined here by Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones  who with me introduced the Count Every Vote Act in 2005 and again in 2007   Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones and I held a hearing in Cleveland after the 2004 election where we heard very gripping and really disheartening testimony about how hard it was for registered voters to be able to exercise their right   Voters would arrive at the polls to discover their names mysteriously absent from the voting rolls   They were unable often to register due to arbitrary rules and barriers in the registration process   Voters were afraid  and with good cause  that their vote wouldnt count because the machines they were using had neither voter verified paper records nor other safeguards     The process itself gives citizens pause  Elections administered by political officials who not only administer the elections but serve in official positions supporting campaigns of candidates  and issue rulings that appear to favor their candidate  certainly doesnt inspire confidence   And we have seen that the brunt of many of the problems in the election process fall especially hard on people of color  not in just widely reported cases in Florida and Ohio but in state after state   Similarly  we have seen problems with elderly voters  Weve seen problems with college students   So this is not about one district or one state  the problems unfortunately are found across our country     Therefore  I think it is imperative that we once again  as the worlds oldest democracy  be a model democracy     I believe meaningful reform must achieve three important goals     First  we have to have twenty first century reforms to ensure that twenty first century technologies help enfranchise voters  not disenfranchise them      We should require the use of voter verified paper records to guarantee voters do have the opportunity not only to verify and correct  if necessary  any error made by a voting system before the permanent voting record is preserved   This voter verified record will also serve as the official ballot for recounts and audits      We can safeguard the legitimate privacy interest of the community of people who have disabilities  and minority language speakers  and ensure they are given the opportunity to cast a secret  independent  and verifiable vote   And I believe we can give states and localities the resources they need and deserve to improve their voting systems    Both the bill introduced by the Chairman and my own require manual audits of election results   They improve the transparency and independence of testing laboratories  They establish a set of security standards for voting machines   They include a ban on undisclosed source codes and a prohibition on the use of wireless communications devices in voting systems      And too many voters cast their votes and never know if their ballots failed to count due to a faulty ballot or machine design   Our bills establish a performance benchmark for these residual votes    The second goal for any reform is making voting fairer and easier by enacting long needed common sense reforms to the registration and election process   We need uniform standards for provisional ballots   We need to make it easier to vote by absentee ballot  We need to facilitate early voting    We have to strengthen poll worker training  and we have to recruit younger people to be poll workers      I dont know about where all of you vote  but where I vote its retirees  The last time we voted in an election  one of the gentlemen told me that he couldnt keep doing this  he was in his late eighties   He said  Cant you help me  Senator   Find some younger people to come in and do this important work   We need to protect citizens from unjustifiable and inaccurate purges of voters from state registration lists    Finally  the third goal of election reform must be to protect voters against political interference and foul play in our democracy   This includes prohibiting chief state election officers from engaging in activities that present a conflict of interest  and establishing fair standards to allow impartial elections observers into polling places    I think its interesting to note that a few years ago  India had an election in which the polling and prognostication before the vote certainly did not predict the outcome   In fact  the ruling party at the time  the BJP Party  was expected to be returned to power   But in a total surprise to most observers  the Congress Party won back the parliament in India  and it was shocking to people in the country and around the world      There were no complaints  and I asked people  Well  how did that happen   Because certainly if something so unexpected did happen in our country there would be all kinds of concerns about the integrity of our electoral system   And the response I received was that India had the equivalent of what we would consider a Federal Reserve Board running their elections  taking it out of political parties completely  overseeing that how it was conducted really would be above reproach   They voted on computers  Im not sure exactly what kind  but they had a computer system that had several fail safes in it  both in the local voting place  at a regional server center  and nationally so that there were no questions that whether you were a dot com billionaire in Mumbai or an illiterate peasant in Rajasthan  you were voting in a way that guaranteed confidence in the outcome    Well  I am confident that under the leadership of Chairman Feinstein and Ranking Member Bennett  and hopefully with a bipartisan commitment to ensuring the integrity of our electoral system  we will undertake the reforms needed to ensure the accuracy and fairness of elections      Every citizen should have his or her right to vote protected   We must count every vote so that every vote counts   We must return integrity to our ballot process  and I thank you for the honor of testifying before you
