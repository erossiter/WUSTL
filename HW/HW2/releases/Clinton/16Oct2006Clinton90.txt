October 16  2006 Senator Clinton Releases Seasonal Flu Vaccine Guide to Help New Yorkers Locate Flu Vaccine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Calls on CDC to Address Continued Failure to Establish Vaccine Tracking System Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today released her third annual Seasonal Flu Vaccine Resource Guide to help New Yorkers get the assistance they need in locating flu vaccines   She also sent a letter to Dr  Julie Gerberding  Director of the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   urging her to improve the agency  s efforts to track seasonal influenza vaccines              At a time when we routinely use tracking to trace deliveries of other goods in the private market  we still cannot accurately predict when a vaccine order might be delivered to a provider     said Senator Clinton     With a tracking system in place  we could better trace the distribution of vaccine from the factory to the provider  allowing us to easily determine where vaccine shortages are occurring and speed vaccine to those areas   All of this could take place in a matter of hours  instead of days or weeks             This year  reports indicate that over 100 million doses of flu vaccine will be made available nationwide  making it easier for seniors  those with chronic illness  and others at risk for complications from the flu to protect themselves   To help New Yorkers locate flu vaccines  Senator Clinton is making available a special resource guide on her website at www clinton senate gov   The guide provides a list of agencies that offer assistance in finding seasonal flu vaccine throughout New York State   New Yorkers will also find information on seasonal flu  the CDC  s priority groups for vaccination and tips to protect them from seasonal flu          Senator Clinton has led the charge to address persistent problems in seasonal flu vaccine distribution   Senator Clinton has introduced the Influenza Vaccine Security Act with Senator Pat Roberts  which will help create a stable flu vaccine market by increasing research into safer  faster  and more reliable methods of vaccine production and establishing a tracking system so the federal government and state and local health departments can gather and share the information they need to ensure that high priority populations will have access to vaccines   It will also increase educational efforts to improve flu vaccination rates  and strengthen the underlying public health infrastructure in order to heighten our ability to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza   Senator Clinton has emphasized that shoring up our seasonal flu vaccine delivery system is critical not only to adequately respond to the regular  annual occurrence of seasonal flu but also to be prepared to respond to the crisis of a pandemic            Senator Clinton  s 2006 seasonal flu vaccine guide for New Yorkers is available here       The following is the text of Senator Clinton  s letter to CDC Director Gerberding          October 16  2006      Julie Louise Gerberding  M D   M P H    Director  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Department of Health   Human Services  1600 Clifton Road  N W    Atlanta  Georgia 30329      Dear Dr  Gerberding        As we begin the 2006 2007 flu season  I write to ask for an update on your agency  s efforts to track seasonal influenza vaccine           Since 2000  our nation has experienced multiple shortages and problems with distribution of influenza vaccine   During these shortages  many of New York  s seniors and providers have contacted me to express frustration at their continuing inability to accurately predict at which point they may be able to receive seasonal influenza vaccine   At a time when we routinely use tracking to trace deliveries of other goods in the private market  we still cannot accurately predict when a vaccine order might be delivered to a provider              I understand that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have  over the past two years  been working with manufacturers  distributors  and state public health officials to track county level distribution of seasonal influenza vaccine   However  as your own website notes  many in the public health community support a more detailed tracking system  through which we can obtain provider level data          Last year  I introduced legislation with Senator Pat Roberts  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  which would enable us to establish a tracking system to trace the distribution of vaccine from the factory to the provider and identify counties with high numbers of priority populations   With such a system in place  we could easily determine in times of shortage where vaccine was most needed and facilitate distribution to those areas   All of this could take place in a matter of hours  rather than days or weeks   The tracking system in this legislation builds upon the current private system of distribution  and would link information through a national database in a manner that does not jeopardize free market competition           I believe that the model in our bill could be valuable to help ease the problems of distribution for both seasonal flu vaccine and the antivirals  medical supplies  and other resources that will be in demand in a pandemic situation   It simply makes sense to establish a tracking system for vaccine distribution that can be used in both seasonal and pandemic events  in order to have a system that is already operational  rather than rely on untried mechanisms in an emergency situation where we will already be facing multiple obstacles to delivery of health care          I would like to receive additional information about the status of your efforts to improve and expand vaccine tracking   While I am aware that you have been engaging in various demonstration projects  I believe that it is important to translate such projects into wider scale tracking efforts that are interoperable with other flu related surveillance and tracking initiatives of the CDC   In your discussions with manufacturers  distributors  public health organizations  and other stakeholders  what issues have you identified in establishing and implementing a provider level tracking system  and how are you working to resolve these concerns   Given your experiences over the past two years with tracking pilot projects  I would ask that you provide me with a detailed timeline for the CDC  s continuing efforts to establish a national tracking system  Finally  I would like more information on the ways in which you are working to integrate tracking systems for seasonal influenza vaccine with our preparation for pandemic influenza          I look forward to continuing to work with you to improve our ability to respond to both our annual seasonal flu epidemic and the threat of pandemic influenza   Thank you in advance for your response          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
