December 12  2006 Senator Clinton Discusses the National Guard and Army Reserve During a Special Broadcast of NPR News Talk of the Nation  Click here to listen to this interview   NPR  s Robert Siegel   Senator Clinton  thank you for joining us on this program         Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton   Thank you very much for doing this program       Siegel      from Fort Dix   We re hearing a couple of things from the people here in the Reserves and the Guard    a great pride in the service they ve performed  and also a desire from several people that benefits that they receive should be comparable to those of standing Army and people in the other services  If we re relying so much on the Guard and the Reserves  why shouldn t they achieve some parity in terms of benefits       Senator Clinton   Well actually  I believe they should   And I ve been making that argument for the last several years  I joined up with my colleague on the Armed Services Committee  Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina  to expand access to health care for National Guard members and Reservists because I was finding throughout New York that  as our young men and women in the Guard and Reserve were being called up for deployment  that they were not ready for deployment because of  you know  various health care issues   they did not have health insurance  often  at the jobs that they held in the civilian sector          And so they weren t prepared when they got there    even though  obviously  once they were called up they would have health care  And  similarly  their families were also not being provided with insurance          So we worked on this for the past three years   And finally we have provided the opportunity for all deployable Guard members and Reservists to buy into the active duty system called TRICARE at a 28 percent cost share  So we re making some progress on that   I mean  it s not parity  but it s progress       Siegel   Will the progress accelerate with a Democratic majority on the Hill  or is it simply too expensive for you to do in the immediate future          Senator Clinton   Well  we re going to have to take a hard look at it  Robert  because I m sure that your previous guests plus your callers have made the point that Guard and Reserve service no longer means one weekend a month and two weeks a year  Something over 380 000 Guard and Reserve members have been deployed since September 11th and  you know  they have performed magnificently  In fact  I m going to put in a plug for my state of New York  that the 42nd Infantry Division was the first division headquarters of a National Guard unit deployed since the Korean War   The entire division went to Iraq  So this is no longer the so called weekend warrior   We are very dependent upon the experience and the skills that our Guard and Reserve members bring into the active duty mission   And I think we re going to have to reconsider how we treat the Guard and Reserve members       Siegel   Because the other way to go is to reconsider the equation we ve struck between standing forces and the Reserves and the Guard   That is   Have we got this right  If we get involved in a war that runs for four  five years  can we rely this heavily on people who still are ostensibly maintaining careers and families back home       Senator Clinton   I don t think so   I have also joined with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advocate for increasing the size of both the Army and the Marine Corps because we are really not only stretching our human resources very thin  we are not adequately prepared for the stress on families and an all volunteer military  We have now been engaged in a very long and bloody conflict with an all volunteer force   And I am a strong supporter of our volunteer military   It s proven itself to be extraordinarily prepared  ready  dedicated  But when you keep deploying people over and over again  and I have  you know  encountered a number of people who are on their third or even fourth deployment with very little time for resting and resetting equipment and being able to just take a deep breath and get a little bit of time with your family  That is not a condition that we can sustain       Siegel   No   But if one part of the solution is actually to increase the size of the Army and the Marine Corps  how can we do that  given the difficulties of just increasing benefits for people in the Guard and Reserves  Is this something that has to wait for the end of the Iraq war  it s some years down the road before you can increase the size of the force       Senator Clinton   Well  I think we need the conversation to start now  It may well be  to go back to your original point  that we change the mix somewhat   We have a very specific set of tasks that we expect the Guard and Reserve to be able to perform   But we  perhaps  look to increase the size of the active duty force  Now  all of that has to be open for discussion   We have a challenge in recruiting and retaining  although I must say that  certainly  it s been quite admirable and very surprising to some to see how well our recruitment and retention numbers have held up  But I think that we re going to have to ask ourselves   How do we afford the military we need   What are our strategic challenges around the world       Siegel   A short answer question before I let you go   Is a draft part of the answer for you  or no       Senator Clinton   No  it s not  You know  if you talk to people in the military who are in today  who were in during Vietnam  even some folks who can remember further back than that  there is no doubt that the officer corps in the military is very impressed by our all volunteer force   And we have to do more to make sure that we can recruit and retain the very best young people that are willing to serve their country in this way       Siegel   Well  Senator Clinton  thank you very much for talking with us today       Senator Clinton   Thank you for doing this   I ll talk to you   Bye bye       Siegel   You bet   Senator Hillary Clinton  Democratic senator from New York State and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee
