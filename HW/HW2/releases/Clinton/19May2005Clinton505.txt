May 19  2005 Clinton  Burns And Nelson Introduce Voice Over Internet E 911 Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Conrad Burns  R MT   the Co Chairs of the Congressional E 911 Caucus today joined Senator Bill Nelson  D FL  to introduce the IP  Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act of 2005   The bill  which was introduced to address the growing concern of Voice Over Internet Protocol  VoIP  subscribers having full access to Enhanced  E  911 service  is incredibly timely in that it coincides with today  s FCC ruling regarding VoIP providers and access to 911 services for their customers           With 3 million VoIP lines expected to be in place by the end of the year and nearly 27 million in place by 2009  it is critical that customers have full access to E 911     Senator Clinton said   Clinton added    This legislation will make certain that VoIP providers have a clear mandate to provide E 911 as well as the means to implement E 911 solutions as soon as possible   Americans have the right to expect that their emergency call  whether made on a land line  cell phone or VoIP phone  receive a rapid response            Advances in technology should make life better  not put our lives on the line   said Senator Bill Nelson  D FL   a member of the Senate panel that oversees telecommunications          As folks continue to move away from land lines and toward cell phones and VoIP services  we must ensure they have the safety net that 911 emergency services allow     said Senator Conrad Burns  R MT      The few seconds it takes someone to realize that their broadband connection cannot reach 911 can be the difference between life and death  and we cannot waste that time during an emergency   I am committed to making sure people in every corner of our country can successfully dial these three numbers from whatever type of phone they  re calling from  and I look forward to passing this bill for the safety of all Americans           E 911 allows emergency call dispatchers to trace the call back number and the location of someone dialing 911 so that information can be routed to the appropriate public safety agency    However  since VoIP telephone customers are connected to broadband internet lines instead of traditional phone lines  ensuring that 911 calls made from VoIP phones are properly routed and responded to  has presented new challenges to public safety officials    There have been several tragedies in which VoIP 911 calls were either routed to closed offices or simply not responded to        Bill McMurray  the President of the National Emergency Number Association which represents 911 administrators throughout the U S  said    NENA is pleased to support the Congressional E911 Caucus in their continued leadership to advance E911 capabilities from any device  any time  everywhere   The introduction of IP E911 legislation demonstrates the urgency to provide vital emergency calling capabilities to all services  We look forward to supporting the E911 Caucus as they continue to lead Congress on vital issues to our nation  s 911 system           The Clinton Burns Nelson bill  which coincides with today  s FCC action addressing VoIP providers to connect all 911 calls made over their service  will allow VoIP companies to patch into the 911 networks operated by the traditional phone companies    The bill also ensures that consumers are fully informed if their VoIP provider cannot ensure that their 911 call will be properly routed in an emergency    Furthermore  the legislation tasks the National E 911 Implementation Coordination Office  created under the Clinton Burns ENHANCE Act signed into law last year  to develop a plan for a nation wide network and make recommendations to Congress in order to ensure that all 911 VoIP calls are properly responded to    Similar legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives as well by Rep  Bart Gordon  D TN  as well as John Shimkus  R IL  and Anna Eshoo  D CA
