May 5  2006 Senator Clinton Announces  14 6 Million for Defense Projects to Benefit the Greater Rochester Region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Funding for New York included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee      Bill also includes provisions to address continuing pay problems for wounded soldiers                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized  14 6 million in Defense projects that will benefit the Greater Rochester Region  including  3 million for General Motors   Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion Project   3 6 million for Icuiti  s Wearable Hyperspectral Imaging System and  8 million for RIT  s Defense Sustainment and Modernization Initiative          The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2007 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill yesterday   The passage of the bill marks the first stage in the Department of Defense appropriations process  Now that the authorization bill has been passed by the Senate Armed Services Committee  the bill will be sent to the Senate floor before heading into the appropriations process  The House of Representatives passed their version of the bill Wednesday            This bill is important not only for our potential military capabilities  but for New York  s economy  In addition to enabling our soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines to have the best training  the best equipment and the best facilities in the world  it makes a number of significant investments in local technology and local companies  which is always welcome     Senator Clinton said    New York companies are already developing the cutting edge technology that will take our military into the future  I am pleased that we can continue to support them and the local economy with these kinds of meaningful investments              Senator Clinton announced that the bill contained a number of highlights for New York  including            The preservation of over  200 million in funding military construction projects for New York which were included in the President  s Budget and which Senator Clinton fought hard to maintain           The preservation of funding for the VH 71A Presidential Helicopter Program  Lockheed Martin Owego is the prime contractor on the program  and          The inclusion of a provision  which Senator Clinton proposed  to name the new laboratory building at the Air Force Research Site in Rome  NY in honor of retiring Rep  Sherwood L  Boehlert  R New Hartford    Rep  John M  McHugh  R Pierrepont Manor  also secured a companion amendment in House defense authorization legislation              During his distinguished Congressional career  Sherry Boehlert has been the foremost champion in Congress of the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome   With his impending retirement from Congress  it is only fitting that we name the new laboratory building after Congressman Boehlert     said Senator Clinton          The bill also included two important amendments that Senator Clinton sponsored to force the Department of the Army to address serious concerns regarding pay issues of wounded soldiers and to analyze troop readiness          In a continuing effort to ensure that those who have given so much are not further burdened with resolving pay account issues  Senator Clinton  s wounded soldier pay audit amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to establish a toll free call assistance center focused on providing wounded members of the Armed Forces  or their primary next of kin  with help relating to military pay issues   The Senator  s amendment also requires the Department of the Army to conduct an audit of its wounded soldiers   pay accounts and report back to Congress in 120 days   As recently as April 26  2006  a Government Accountability Office report found that nearly 1 300 battle injured soldiers and soldiers killed in combat in the first 4 years of the Global War on Terror  had incurred a total of  1 5 million in debt   Press reports have also revealed that the Army has granted more than 600 requests by soldiers for debt forgiveness   totaling more than  600 000   on the basis that the debt was wrongly charged  This is just the latest in a series of actions taken by Senator Clinton on this significant issue as the treatment of wounded soldiers remains one of her top priorities   In the past  she has called on Congress to hold hearings  written to the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Army to investigate specific cases  and called for reviews of the broader problems with the pay process  particularly as it applies to those wounded in a combat zone            I am deeply troubled  as I think we all should be  about continuing reports of soldiers who have been withdrawn from combat on the basis of medical issues and have experienced payroll problems or have been wrongly charged for certain services or equipment   It is simply unacceptable that we should be billing our soldiers for debts wrongly incurred or exacerbated by bureaucratic pay and personnel systems     Senator Clinton said     We must do everything in our power to avoid placing wounded soldiers in the position of having to resolve payroll problems or to request debt forgiveness  These warriors are recovering from the injuries they sustained while they were fighting for our country and they should not have to deal with this kind of additional burden             Senator Clinton  s amendment addressing our military  s readiness is part of a continuing effort to study the current state of our ground forces and better highlight where Congress should focus its efforts to ensure the continued preparedness of our Army and Marine Corps            I am concerned about the strain on the ground forces of our Nation  s military and their ability to continue at the current pace in Iraq  Afghanistan  and other theaters of operation   We must continue to focus on recruiting and retaining our forces  training and equipping them in a manner that ensures they are able to meet today  s challenges and future requirements     Senator Clinton said          Local funding details include        3 million for General Motors   Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion Project      In FY 06  General Motors   Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion was awarded  2 million to conduct a demonstration of the latest generation of hydrogen fuel cell technology in an SUV style  The authorization of funding for FY07 will expand on current demonstrations with further enhanced fuel cell technology providing significantly improved capabilities and performance in a commercially based non tactical SUV style vehicle  The fuel cell SUV vehicle delivery is planned for 3rd quarter 2007 with operations through 1st quarter 2010        3 6 million for Icuiti  s Wearable Hyperspectral Imaging System      The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes  3 6 million in funding to complete development of a Wearable Hyperspectral Imaging System   Hyperspectral Imaging  HSI  is imaging of a scene over a large number of selectable  discrete  contiguous spectral bands such that a complete reflectance spectrum can be obtained for the region being imaged   By turning a dial  the imager can quickly see though several different light spectrums  giving the user a significant advantage at night or even in seeing through smoke or fog   Currently  HSI systems are in use on vehicles and some larger unmanned vehicles   Icuiti  s systems would provide this significant capability to dismounted soldiers or smaller squad based teams for the first time       8 million for RIT  s Defense Sustainment and Modernization Initiative      The Senate Armed Services Committee bill authorizes  8 million in funding for Rochester Institute of Technology  s Defense Sustainment and Modernization Initiative   The objective of this research program is to improve the modernization  readiness and sustainment of defense systems by developing processes and tools to track the status and future health of defense systems  detect  diagnose and repair material aging failures  and provide decision support systems for use in determining when and how to upgrade these systems  The Department of Defense  while developing new systems that will enable a leap ahead or transformation in military capability  must simultaneously maintain and improve the capabilities of existing systems  The number and complexity of legacy systems  as well as the staggering replacement costs  demand that attention and resources continue to be effectively allocated to current systems  This research program provides DOD with a comprehensive approach to address these issues based on life cycle engineering principles  Over the past several years  these programs have already yielded significant cost savings for the manufacture and upgrade of several platforms and systems  as well as significantly extending the life of existing systems
