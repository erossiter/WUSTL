November 3  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Reauthorization of Amtrak                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Our difficult fight to save Amtrak is paying off with the Senate passage of this reauthorization legislation   Amtrak is an essential component of our transportation network that provides irreplaceable capacity and mobility to New York and the nation  The future without Amtrak would be devastating  This reauthorization provides for critical infrastructure and capital improvement grants that will ensure Amtrak s long term stability and security  It also contains some important reform measures designed to address past problems  Today s vote is a huge victory for all Amtrak supporters and I was proud to co sponsor this amendment           New Yorkers rely on rail more than perhaps any other state in the nation   Penn Station is the busiest passenger rail station in the United States   almost 9 million passengers boarded Amtrak trains there in 2004   New York also contains the busiest commuter rail system in the country            Earlier this year  the Administration sought to slash Amtrak s federal funding which would have eliminated critical rail service to millions of New Yorkers and others who ride our rails  It would have thrown our commuter rail lines into chaos and would have had catastrophic economic consequences for the state and the region   I  m proud that we fought back to ensure that Amtrak was there for the people of New York and the nation  It is my sincere hope that the Amtrak reauthorization legislation will be sent to the President s desk for his signature very soon
