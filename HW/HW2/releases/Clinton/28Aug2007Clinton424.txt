August 28  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on New Census Data Underscoring Need to Expand Access to Children s Health Insurance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC  The new Census health insurance data released today shows an increase of almost 700 000 children without health insurance  up from eight million in 2005   This should be a wake up call to this Administration that their attempts to cut rather than expand the SCHIP program are taking this country in the wrong direction  It is unacceptable that we have 8 7 million children without health insurance and is further proof that we need to pass    and the President needs to sign    a Childrens Health Insurance bill that strengthens and expands coverage for Americas kids   With an increase of 33 000 uninsured children  New York will be especially hard hit if the Presidents plan to scale back CHIP is not reversed
