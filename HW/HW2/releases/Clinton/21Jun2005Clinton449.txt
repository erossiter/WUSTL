June 21  2005 Senator Urges Congress to Support  Funding for School Nutrition Programs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today continued her campaign to preserve the health and well being of our nation s children by urging increased funding for critical US Department of Agriculture child nutrition programs in the coming fiscal year  In a letter sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Agriculture  Rural Development  and Related Agencies  Senator Clinton called on them to continue to support and expand a number of school programs that fall under the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004  The Subcommittee is scheduled to consider funding options in the Fiscal Year 2006 Agricultural Appropriations bill today         These programs provide healthy food options in school cafeterias  they teach kids about good nutrition  they show them the importance of agriculture and they also support local farms by keeping food dollars within the community   Senator Clinton said          Nutrition education programs  which cost mere cents per child  are critically under funded despite being vital in the campaign to create healthy eaters and physically active adults from today s youth   Senator Clinton said   The cost of improving the health of our children now is far less than the cost of the health consequences to come if we do nothing  I call on my colleagues to look closely at the funding levels for these programs and help create a healthy future for our children         In her letter  Senator Clinton specifically requested support for The Fruit and Vegetable Program  Team nutrition network  Nutrition promotion  Healthy school nutrition environment demonstrations  Farm to cafeteria projects  School garden grant demonstration  and Access to local foods  These programs focus on the nutrition  education  and overall well being of American children         In her letter  Senator Clinton noted that obesity rates are increasing in America s youth  who are consuming significantly less fruit and vegetables than the United States Department of Agriculture suggests in the 2005 Dietary Guidelines  This has been closely linked to the rise of Type 2 diabetes  high blood pressure  and high cholesterol rates among children  which increases their risk for additional chronic diseases later in life  Senator Clinton hopes that we can decrease these problems by encouraging healthy eating options for our kids in our schools         A copy of Senator Clinton s letter to the Chairman and Ranking member is attached        June 20  2005       The Honorable Robert Bennett  Chairman  Subcommittee on Agriculture  Rural Development  and Related Agencies  Committee on Appropriations  SD 188  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510       The Honorable Herb Kohl  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Agriculture  Rural Development  and Related Agencies  Committee on Appropriations  SH 123  United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510       Dear Chairman Bennett and Ranking Member Kohl        I write to urge you to support and expand funding for important programs in FY2006 that promote sound nutrition and healthy eating in our nation s schools        Childhood obesity is reaching epidemic proportions among America s youth  with obesity rates doubling among children and tripling in adolescents over the past 20 years  Childhood obesity ahs been closely linked with the increased occurrence of Type 2 diabetes and increased rates of high cholesterol and high blood pressure among children  Overweight children and adolescents are more likely to become overweight adults  which increases their risk for serious chronic diseases later in life        The January 2005 United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  Dietary Guidelines  which by federal law are the basis of USDA food programs and nutrition education programs  place a strong emphasis on the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables  Yet  according to the USDA only fourteen percent of children meet the recommended levels for fruit consumption and only twenty percent for vegetables  Studies have shown that fruit and vegetable consumption plays a role in the prevention of many chronic conditions  including cardiovascular disease  cancer  hypertension  obesity and diabetes  Children with unhealthy eating patterns tend to maintain those unhealthy habits into adulthood  We need to encourage healthy eating options for our kids  in our schools        Specifically  I would like to see the continued support and expansion of the following important school programs from the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 that affect the nutrition  education and overall well being of our children             The Fruit and Vegetable Program  This program provides free fresh fruit and vegetables in eight states and on three Indian reservations  It is currently authorized at a level of  9 million  Unfortunately  at current funding levels  the Fruit and Vegetable Program can only serve a small fraction of our nation s children in just a limited number of schools  We need to expand this program to all states             Team nutrition network  This program will provide grants to states for nutrition education activities for children  and for training and technical assistance to states  schools  and community             Nutrition promotion  This program enables the Secretary to make annual payments to states  using a formula based on a state s proportion of meals served under the Richard B  Russell School Lunch Act  to promote nutrition in food service programs             Healthy school nutrition environment demonstrations  This program provides funds to conduct demonstrations in elementary and secondary schools to create healthy school nutrition environments and evaluate the impact on the health and well being of the students              Farm to cafeteria projects  This program allows USDA to provide one time grants of up to  100 000 to eligible community organizations working with schools to develop food procurement relationships with local farmers  develop infrastructure to store and prepare fresh foods  develop seasonal menus and promotions materials and develop hands on nutrition education related to agriculture              School garden grant demonstration  This program provides  15 million for a demonstration to provide grants to states  schools or nonprofit organizations to support school gardens             Access to local foods  This program provides competitive matching grants to schools and nonprofits for projects that improve access to local foods for schools and institutions participating in federal meal programs and support nutrition education programs         I appreciate your consideration of these important programs and urge you to support fresh food choices at our nation s school and healthy lifestyles for American kids        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
