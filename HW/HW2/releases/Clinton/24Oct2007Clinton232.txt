                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Contract Allows City of Rochester to Address Community Development Strategies to Reflect Local Housing Needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  to renew the Asset Control Area Agreement  ACA  for Rochester  New York for an additional two years  In a letter  Senator Clinton urged HUD Office of Single Family Asset Management Director Vance Morris  to renew the Citys ACA contract citing the critical role it plays their efforts to implement community development strategies that reflect local housing needs  including an increase in homeownership    We all want to do our part to help our cities and neighborhoods thrive  and the ACA program has been a vital part of Rochesters efforts to continue the city s redevelopment and growth  said Senator Clinton  In addition to assisting in the stabilization of neighborhoods  these houses are great investments for working families who are first time homeowners  This is why it is important that HUD extend the City of Rochesters ACA contract for an additional two years    The City of Rochester and its non profit partner  the Rochester Housing Development Fund Corporation  have successfully operated an ACA contract since HUD created the program  with their current contract set to expire at the end of 2007  Under the program  Rochester has made the purchase and renovation of ACA properties a cornerstone of its efforts to address the devastating effect of foreclosures and vacant properties  ACA properties in Rochester are renovated  affordable  and lead safe homes for low income first time homebuyers  The renovated houses not only make terrific investments for Rochesters new homeowners  they serve to stabilize neighborhoods    The ACA program is a powerful tool for HUD to quickly move assets from its inventory  while empowering local governments to implement community development strategies that reflect local housing needs including an increase in homeownership       A copy of the letter to Director Morris is attached       October 24  2007   Mr  Vance Morris  Director  Office of Single Family Asset Management  U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  Room 9184  451 7th Street  SW  Washington  D C  20410   Dear Director Morris    I am writing to request your assistance in extending the Asset Control Area Agreement  ACA  for Rochester  New York   The City of Rochester and its non profit partner  the Rochester Housing Development Fund Corporation  have successfully operated an ACA contract since HUD created the program   The current contract will expire at the end of 2007   I fully support the work being done in Rochester through ACA and ask that the contract be extended for two additional years    Rochester has made the purchase and renovation of ACA properties a cornerstone of its efforts to address the devastating effect of foreclosures and vacant properties   ACA properties in Rochester are renovated  affordable  lead safe homes for low income  first time homebuyers   The renovated houses not only make terrific investments for Rochesters new homeowners  they serve to stabilize neighborhoods    Rochester has operated the ACA program for a number of years in designated neighborhoods  making the impact of renovations and sales strong and visible   Through this program and other initiatives  345 homes have been sold through Home Rochester since 2001     As you know  HUD has audited the ACA contract in Rochester on an annual basis since it was created   The audits have always demonstrated that the Rochester ACA program is well managed and fiscally sound   The City of Rochester is prepared to continue to provide the project oversight and subsidy required to operate the ACA program   The Rochester Housing Development Fund Corporation has obtained private sector financing for the program in the form of construction financing   41 000 000 committed since 2000  and mortgages  over  21 000 000       The ACA program is a powerful tool for HUD to quickly move assets from its inventory  while empowering local governments to implement community development strategies that reflect local housing needs including an increase in homeownership   I urge you to continue the success of this innovative partnership in Rochester  New York by extending the ACA agreement for two additional years    Thank you for your consideration    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton   cc
