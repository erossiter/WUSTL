July 7  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on London Terrorist Attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I join all New Yorkers and Americans in mourning the loss of so many in London in this vicious act of terrorism   Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims  their families and all of the people of London today  and in the painful days ahead  as they struggle to recover in the wake of this devastating attack            This brutal and senseless act is a tragic reminder that we need to do everything we can to safeguard our own transit systems  It is imperative that the millions of New Yorkers who travel on trains and buses know that our tunnels and facilities continue to operate with the highest security operations in place   The President  s budget calls for a  50 million cut in funding for rail and transit security this year  which is clearly a step in the wrong direction   As the Senate considers the Homeland Security Appropriations bill next week  I will work to ensure that we provide the resources needed to meet our rail and transit security needs
