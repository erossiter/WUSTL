April 13  2005 Schumer  Clinton  Key Senate Panel Authorizes  198 Million in Funds For New Yorks Waterways                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Funding for several key projects included in Water Resources Development Act approved by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has authorized  198 million for New York City under the Water Resources Development Act  WRDA   including a  180 million for an ecosystem restoration project for Jamaica Bay and  18 2 million for Orchard Beach in the Bronx  The bill includes a provision to help the Port of New York and New Jersey to develop a dredged material management facility   The bill  which was passed by the Committee today  must now be approved by the full Senate before being sent to a House and Senate Conference Committee         The Water Resources Development Act authorizes Corps of Engineers civil works projects  including navigation  ecosystem restoration and shoreline protection projects   Under the authorizations  the Corps partners with local sponsors to conduct the projects            The Corps of Engineers has an excellent record protecting and improving New York waterways   with a good return on the investment for taxpayers  Nobody is better than the Corps for cleaning out the sediment that accumulates on harbor floors that makes it harder for big ships to deliver and pick up goods here   Now  for the first time  we  re developing a good new system to reuse that accumulation as a building material     Senator Schumer said          New York  s waterways are the lifeblood of the city    transporting thousands of tons of goods each day  sheltering diverse wildlife and providing recreational fun for millions of people each year  This bill will help the Corps continue to keep the port running smoothly   It will also help the Corps to clean up and restore beaches and bays around the city for future generations     Senator Clinton said        The Senators announced that the bill passed by Committee today included the following authorizations       Jamaica Bay  Marine Park and Plum Beach Ecosystem Restoration    The bill includes a  180 million authorization for an ecosystem restoration project for Jamaica Bay  NY   The federal government share of the costs would be  117 million   The project would restore valuable inter tidal wetland areas in Jamaica Bay to support fish and wildlife habitat in this highly diverse and nationally significant ecosystem   It is expected that eight specific sites will be recommended for work by the Corps of Engineers   The authorization is dependent on completion of a Chief of Engineer  s report  which is expected by the end of 2005        Orchard Beach    The bill modifies an existing authorization for Orchard Beach in the Bronx  New York  to increase the authorization to  18 2 million   Orchard Beach is visited by more than two million people each year  but the beach is suffering from severe erosion and the sand needs to be replenished   The purpose of this project is to restore and stabilize this heavily utilized public recreational beach  The Water Resources Development Acts of 1992 and 1996 authorized a total of  5 6 million for the study and execution of an Orchard Beach shoreline protection project   The current WRDA would increase that authorization to  18 2 million         New York Harbor Dredged Material Management Facility     The bill includes a provision to help the Port of New York and New Jersey to develop a dredged material management facility   The disposal of sediments dredged from New York Harbor has become increasingly more costly over the past decade due to the Environmental Protection Agency  s promulgation of more stringent rules governing the disposal of these materials at sea   This has led to efforts in both New York and New Jersey to find beneficial uses for dredged materials   Most of these efforts to date have focused on using dredged materials that have been processed with additives such as Portland Cement or incinerator ash to create a stable  construction material that have been successfully used as a grading material at landfills and brownfields   Development of the facility will enable more flexibility in matching the timing of the availability of dredge material with the needs of end users  which will encourage competition and reduce the costs of upland dredge material disposal   The facility would accept dredged material from both federal channels and private berthing facilities
