February 27  2007 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Calls for Strategic Energy in Remarks to the Apollo Alliance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The Apollo Alliance has been a unique effort to lead the fight and you are doing it long before others come to the party  And it has been a tremendous asset in trying to make the linkage between those who care about the environment and those who care about the economy   There s really no contradiction and the Apollo Alliance has made that so clear  And we re indebted to you because a clean energy agenda is a jobs agenda   And let me repeat that because still too often people try to set the environment against the economy   But a clean energy agenda is a jobs agenda and we have to take that message and drive it home day after day   It is certainly a major part in what I m saying as I travel around the country              You know  just yesterday I was back in New York    which I love to be  yes we ve got some New Yorker s here I know    looking for ways to highlight what we re doing in our state to try to create a clean energy future  new jobs and begin to deal with climate change   I toured a facility in Tonawanda  which is outside of Buffalo  which is an old power generating plant    been there since 1916   It s about to become the first coal plant in our country with next generation clean coal technology to sequester and to store carbon dioxide  Building that plant will mean a thousand construction jobs and a hundred permanent jobs   So we re going to combat global warming  produce the energy that the people in the region need and help develop new technology that will give us insight into how best to deal with the challenges posed by coal           In Rochester  yesterday I joined local officials with whom I ve been working for several years to unveil a  Greenprint  for the city   The  Greenprint  is a plan to make Rochester a leader in becoming more energy efficient and developing new businesses and jobs around alternative energy   I asked the U S  Green Building Counsel to help me help the city put that together after I held a conference sponsored by a group I started called  New Jobs for New York  that highlighted alternative energy possibilities for the greater Rochester area  Now local leaders  both from the public and the private sector  are posed to implement this plan   It will continue to build on the work that has already been done in fuel cells and dealing with new ways of producing bio fuels and bio diesel out of our research universities there  as well as our businesses             And finally  I visited a bio fuels facility in Upstate New York  near Oswego  which some of you may recall from news reports had 12 feet of snow last week  They have dug out   They are resilient   They are actually enjoying the snow mobiles now  And investors have turned a shuttered brewery into a 21st century energy producer  It will also deliver hundreds of construction jobs and about a hundred permanent new jobs in an area of our state that is looking for new sources of employment            What we re proving in New York  as many of you are proving around the country  is that the energy challenge is not  despite some of what we hear from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue  a zero sum game   It is not   By pursuing these opportunities we can grow the economy and shrink our dependence on foreign oil  we can slow global warming and create thousands  I would argue millions  of new good jobs  we can protect our security and our environment  And this is what Americans do best   We are problem solvers   There has been this kind of hint of fatalism that has crept into the air around here in Washington over the last six years   It s as though we can t deal with a lot of our serious problems from health care  to energy  to the environment  to education  to stem cell research or anything else   We can t do it   Well  I just reject that out of hand            You re so well named   The Apollo Alliance set a goal in the 1960 s when President Kennedy said we would send a man to the moon by the end of the decade   That is what Americans do best   We need to challenge ourselves   We need to ask more of ourselves  We need to demand that we do what we can and that s to role our sleeves up  put our businesses  our labor unions  our universities  our government and our citizens to work            This is absolutely about what Al Gore said the other night on the Oscars   This is about our will  Yes  it s about our government will  but it s also about our business will  our labor will  our citizens  will  And that s why the Apollo Alliance is so critical because you have recognized that from the very beginning            Today I m reintroducing legislation to create a Strategic Energy Fund to put our nation on the road to energy security   Our future demands that our oil companies become energy companies and that whole new industries be created to develop new sources of energy   We have to start by repealing the billions in new tax breaks that were just given to the oil industry  but we have to go much further              As the price of oil has risen  oil company profits have skyrocketed   And just one month ago  Exxon Mobile announced the highest profits of any company in the history of the world   Well  we have to tell the oil companies to play or pay when it comes to renewable energy   Either invest more of their windfall profits in alternative energy development or pay into a Strategic Energy Fund that will support the research and investment we need to get this country substantially off oil and on to cleaner and more secure forms of energy            Here s how the Strategic Energy Fund would work   We make a  50 billion investment into the research development and deployment of clean energy  an Apollo Project for Energy  funded in part by ending the big new tax breaks for oil companies and asking these companies to pay their fair share for our shared energy future   The Fund starts by  investing in technologies and ideas that exist right now  like those I saw yesterday in Upstate New York that can be quickly moved to contribute to a cleaner more independent future  accelerating homegrown and family farm grown biofuels by extending the ethanol tax credit until 2012  and speeding the development of cellulosic ethanol by providing loan guarantees for the first billion gallons of commercial production capacity and providing  2 billion for cellulosic ethanol research  moving us toward the goal of 25 percent renewable electricity by expanding the production tax credit for wind power and other renewables for five years  investing  3 5 billion into new clean coal technologies that can capture and store carbon dioxide to reduce the growing threat of global warming  boosting incentives to promote energy efficiency and conservation in our homes and businesses  putting cleaner more efficient vehicles on the road by quadrupling consumer tax breaks for hybrids and for clean diesel and for other advanced vehicles and  creating new tax incentives for auto manufactures to retool their existing facilities           I read your Ten Point Plan for Good Jobs and Energy Independence and much of what the fund will promote is exactly the direction for which you are pushing  cleaner vehicles  energy efficiency  renewables and more  And while investing in technologies available right now  the fund will also unleash American ingenuity by creating a  9 billion funded  Advance Research Projects Agency  for energy  just like we did after Sputnik went up when President Eisenhower created DARPA            DARPA has been the source of extraordinary research advances including birthing the Internet   Well  we need to do the same for energy   What s happening now with DARPA  as some of you know  is they re being directed in very operational  utilitarian ways to do certain research that is directly connected to threats that our military faces   I support that  but we are losing what made DARPA an incubator of great ideas that wouldn t come to fruition for years   We need to take the old concept of DARPA and make it applicable to energy  to look toward the horizon  explore new ideas  think outside the box or the tank            Now you may have heard that we have a lot going on here in Congress and we do   It is far better to be in the majority than the minority  having been in both now   And what a difference a change makes serving under Chairwoman Barbara Boxer on the Environment Committee   And we re working to try to reach a consensus about bills we can bring to the floor and work to get the magic number we need   in the Senate its 60  to push forward an agenda of clean energy  of climate change control and all the rest we are hoping to achieve            So  we have a big decision to make   We really are at a turning point   We can wait for something terrible to happen and then try to respond    a threat that is imminent here at home that we all see and feel as a previous generation thought of Sputnik    or we can be smart again as Americans and start planning for the future and taking steps that will take us to that new future  will in effect  create that new future for us            As I travel around the country  I know people are ready   What we are lacking is the leadership that will create the framework that will move us down this path that we must take             Yesterday  when I was in Tonawanda  I was with a professor from the University of Buffalo who has worked on energy related issues  he s a professor of engineering most of his career   He said he got into doing it in the late 70 s when he was in graduate school and we had the first oil shock and we actually began to respond as a nation   We had a set of policies that President Carter championed and he decided to  this professor decided to  make his career in looking for how he could contribute to changing America s energy future   Well  we all know what happened  price of gas fell  a new administration came to town and basically  the baby steps we were taking were eliminated   So  now it s thirty years later   We re kind of starting over again   We could not imagine all that has happened in the last thirty years and we know we ve got to act now            Well  two examples    one domestic  one international    show what happens when people stay with it   Internationally  Brazil stayed with it  didn t they   They faced the same oil shock  they saw the same challenges to their economy and they kept working to turn sugar cane  which they had an abundance  into a form of fuel   You all know the rest   Here at home  California stayed with it   For thirty years they kept being more energy efficient  they kept on with their conservation efforts   So  today the per capita usage of electricity in California has stayed flat for thirty years while it has gone up 50 percent in the rest of the country            So  when people say to me or when I hear the President or the Vice President say that we can t take these steps because we ll wreck our economy  that is just flat untrue   We know how to do this   We have examples from right here at home and we have examples from around the world   What we have to do now in this Democratic Congress is begin to act together              So  stay with it   I believe you re making progress   I thank you for forming this Alliance to demonstrate clearly  as Anna said in her remarks  it s not just about energy independence and security   It s not just about the environment  as critical an issue as that is   What we do  with respect to a clean energy future and climate change  will determine whether we sustain the American middle class  whether there are good paying jobs in the future  whether we have a chance for people to be part  once again  of a trade union movement that gives them and their children a better future because our country will be back on the right track   So this could not be more important or bigger              So as you go knock on those doors  do everything you can to make the case this is a win win win for America and if we walk away from it this time  I m not sure how we will ever get back to doing what we have to do for the future of our country               Listen to Senator Clinton discuss her plan on a conference call with reporters   Read more about Senator
