February 2  2006 Schumer  Clinton Welcome Pentagon Rethink of Proposed Cuts to National Guard                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     News comes as Senators voice their opposition to cuts that would have meant a loss of almost 17 000 personnel for the Army National Guard as well as reductions in the end strength of the Air National Guard                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington DC    U S  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed a decision by the Pentagon today to revisit their proposal to make dramatic cuts to the size of the National Guard in the upcoming fiscal year  According to recent press reports  the Department of Defense had planned to submit  as part of the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Budget  a proposal to Congress cutting the Army National Guard by almost 17 000 personnel as well as making substantial reductions in the end strength of the Air National Guard           The news of the Pentagon  s decision today came as the Senators joined a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues  calling on U S  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to reject the proposed cuts  The letter  widely publicized and well known in Pentagon circles while it was being circulated for senators   signatures  was released as Army officials announced their intention to back off a plan to cut 17 000 National Guard personnel and instead to maintain its earlier recommended force level   The Air Force has yet to reveal its full plans             As we fight a global war on terror  now would be the wrong time to cut back on our National Guard and Reserve forces     Senator Schumer said     These brave men and women play a unique role in keeping our communities safe at home  and honorably serve in our military operations overseas   The men and women of New York  s National Guard have answered the call of their State and Nation in response to the 9 11 terrorist attacks and made a significant contribution to our national security   Although we  ll have to wait to know for sure until the Department of Defense releases its official plan  I  m glad to see it appears that the Pentagon is coming to its senses               From their rapid response in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks and the hurricanes along the Gulf Coast  to their significant missions overseas  the brave men and women of the National Guard play a vital and important role in ensuring our nation  s security     Senator Clinton said    While I look forward to seeing the Pentagon  s revised budget proposal  I am very pleased by reports that they are revisiting their initial estimates  which would have had a drastic impact on the National Guard  Our Guard and Reserve forces are integral to protecting our country in the post 9 11 world  I will continue to work with my colleagues to pressure the Administration against any cutbacks in their funding or personnel levels              Schumer and Clinton  who are both members of the Senate National Guard Caucus  voiced their serious concerns about the proposed cuts  along with 73 other Senators in a Caucus sponsored letter to Secretary Rumsfeld today  In the letter  the Senators pointed out that because the National Guard serves both as the nation  s primary military reserve as well as an emergency response force  the reductions would weaken their function as a dual purpose force and would significantly undermine their capacity to accomplish its diverse missions abroad as well as at home  The Senators also noted that the proposed cuts would be a cost ineffective budget response as a well trained National Guard fulfills its duties at a fraction of the cost of an active duty force             A copy of the letter is attached          February 2  2006          The Honorable Donald H  Rumsfeld  Secretary of Defense  The Pentagon  Room 3E880  Washington  DC  20301 1000          Dear Secretary Rumsfeld           According to recent press reports  the Department of Defense plans to submit  as part of the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Budget  a proposal to Congress cutting the Army National Guard by almost 17 000 personnel as well as making substantial reductions in the end strength of the Air National Guard   If true  we strongly oppose these proposals           As you well know  the National Guard  s dual purpose force has  once again  demonstrated its inherent importance to the security of the nation   No other contribution better illustrates this point then the fact that almost 40 percent of U S  ground personnel in Iraq are members of the National Guard   Clearly  this statistic confirms the essential role of the Guard in our nation  s Total Force strategy   Simultaneously  the National Guard  s response to hurricanes Katrina and Rita demonstrated the value of the Guard  s equally vital mission  to support civilian authorities  defend the homeland  and respond to emergencies at home             It is our understanding that these proposed cuts are in response to emerging budget realities   However  we firmly believe that reductions in personnel strength to the National Guard are not cost effective   In fact  many cost benefit analyses show that the National Guard provides a higher level of capability for each dollar of investment   This is true  in part  because the force leverages the skills and expertise that Guard personnel maintain in their civilian professions           Therefore  we will respectfully oppose proposals to cut the end strength of the National Guard and hope to work with you to ensure the Guard maintains a robust capability to meet its responsibilities as a dual purpose force              Thank you for your attention to this matter           Sincerely
