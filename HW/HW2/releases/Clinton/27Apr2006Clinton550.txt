April 27  2006 Clinton Calls For Study Into Economic Impact Of The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Recent Changes to Border Passports Proposal Still Very Short on Details     Senator Says Proposal Should Not Proceed Until Comprehensive Economic Impact Analysis is Completed                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Congress to stop the development of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  until a comprehensive study on the economic impact of the initiative has been completed          In written testimony presented to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations  Senator Clinton said that Congress should not permit a new identification requirement at the border to proceed until the General Accounting Office or a similar body has an opportunity to complete an analysis of the economic impact the proposal will have on tourism and trade in this country              An identification requirement could have a massive impact on the economies and the communities of New York and other border states   The stakes of this proposal are far too high for us to march forward blindly without any knowledge of its economic impact     the Senator said in her statement           Reacting to the Bush Administration  s recent announcement about changes to the passport only proposal  Senator Clinton said that while the administration  s revised proposal demonstrates that they are starting to recognize how burdensome the provisions of the WHTI would be on New York  s Northern Border families and businesses  she was still concerned that not enough was being done to take into account the economic impact of the proposal                The Administration has begun to walk back from its original strict passport requirement in recent months  suggesting that a new passport card and most recently  a daily pass for infrequent travelers  could be used as substitutes for a passport at the Canadian border   While the Administration  s proposal demonstrates that they are starting to recognize how burdensome the provisions of the WHTI would be on our northern border families and businesses  I am still concerned that these new proposals do not do nearly enough to assure Americans that the Administration is committed to easing the severe practical and economic hardships that the WHTI could have on northern border communities   Furthermore  these proposals are still very thin on details     the Senator said in her statement            As I have long maintained  national security and  in particular  security at our borders  must be paramount     However  it is crucial that any new identification requirements for travel between the United States and Canada be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on families  tourism  and the regional economies along our northern border   There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers that the Initiative  s identification requirement would not only devastate the tourism and retail industry  but also greatly disrupt life on both sides of the American Canadian border     the Senator said           The text of Senator Clinton  s written testimony is attached       Testimony Of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Before The Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hearing On The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative         April 27  2006      At the outset  I would like to thank Senator Coleman for the opportunity to offer these remarks   I also commend him for calling for this hearing   The proposed Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative    WHTI    or the   Initiative     is a matter of tremendous importance to New Yorkers and all Americans living along the United States Canada border   The WHTI not only has far reaching economic consequences  but also widespread social ramifications for our communities along the northern border            As I have long maintained  national security and  in particular  security at our borders  must be paramount   Since joining the Senate  I have made security at New York  s northern border a top priority   However  it is crucial that any new identification requirements for travel between the United States and Canada be sensitive to the potentially serious impact on families  tourism  and the regional economies along our northern border   There is tremendous concern among New Yorkers that the Initiative  s identification requirement would not only devastate the tourism and retail industry  but also greatly disrupt life on both sides of the American Canadian border          I have repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the impact of the Initiative since it was first previewed in April 2005   At the time  the administration had proposed a rule that would have required a passport or perhaps frequent user cards such as NEXUS or SENTRI to travel across the northern border   Shortly thereafter  I spoke with Secretary Chertoff personally about this critical matter and wrote to both Secretary Chertoff and Secretary Rice to share my concerns about the proposal   I expressed to them that while I appreciate why DHS and the State Department support this rule  my view was that its approach tilted the balance too far against having a border that is both safe and convenient to cross for most people   I strongly believe that this is an issue on which we can find a solution that protects our security and at the same time allows for legal  unencumbered travel across the border   Indeed  our border communities need both to thrive              There is little doubt that the WHTI  if implemented wrongly  would severely affect the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the American Canadian border   The exchange of goods between the United States and Canada is the largest trading relationship in the world   Thirty nine states sell more of their products to Canada than to any other export market   In 2003  Canadians made over 5 7 million visits to New York and Michigan  spending over  550 million   Residents of those two states visited Canada over 16 million times in 2003   These numbers would likely decrease dramatically if a new  potentially onerous form of documentation were required to enter the United States            This decrease could be devastating to the national economies of both countries  and most especially  to the economies of northern border communities in New York   New York and Canada boast the largest bilateral tourism industry in the United States  with residents from both places crossing the border an average of 11 343 times per day   In 2004  16 5 million passenger vehicles crossed the border at just seven of the 17 land ports of entry between Canada and New York  and 89 000 buses crossed at just four of those ports   Canadians visited New York State almost 2 3 million times and spent  487 million on trips there in 2004  while New Yorkers made more than 1 9 million trips to Canada           According to the Buffalo Niagara Partnership  Partnership   which represents nearly 3 000 employer members  requiring a passport for entry into the U S    will devastate the tourism and retail industry on both sides of the Canadian American border      Similarly  according to the Plattsburgh North Country Chamber of Commerce and its thousands of members    to require passports  or NEXUS cards where available  for U S  and Canadian citizens to cross the U S  Canadian border      will substantially discourage cross border travel    and   will depress travel and economic benefit    for both nations            The WHTI requirements could also have a profoundly negative impact on the people of the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne   The Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne is part of the Greater Mohawk Nation   They presently live on a number of territories stretching along the Ottawa and St  Lawrence Rivers  by Lake Ontario and beyond  all the way to Brantford  Ontario  Canada   Given its unique location  the 7 000 members of this community would be devastated by the WHTI   For example  the Akwesasne Mohawk Casino attracts over 600 000 visitors annually  with approximately 50 percent of their guests hailing from Canada   A recent informal poll of Mohawk business owners showed that 20 percent of their customers were from the other side of the border            Apart from these economic consequences  the Initiative also poses a threat to the daily lives of the Mohawk community   For example  the Mohawk people often take several trips across the border each day and account for approximately 70 percent of border traffic in the area   Imposing upon them the type of travel restrictions contemplated by the Initiative would have a detrimental effect on many aspects of their daily lives   Perhaps most disturbing  the Initiative could interrupt the cross border travel of 1 300 Mohawk students living on the Canadian side of the border who attend the Salmon River and Massena school districts located on the U S  side            This last example underscores an important point   The WHTI could disrupt not only the businesses and economies of border communities  but their very way of life   The people who live in these shared border areas do not regard themselves as Americans or Canadians  but rather as one community of neighbors   American children play sports in Canadian youth leagues   Canadian families visit relatives who live in the U S   Americans and Canadians frequent each others homes and businesses with little regard for the demarcation of the border   Under the Initiative  it could potentially cost hundreds of dollars for a New York family to make the short trip across the border to visit a family member or a friend   Limiting their ability to interact by forcing upon them the restrictions outlined in the Initiative would create a wall splitting one community into two              For all of these reasons  requiring onerous and expensive identification documents for U S  citizens to cross the border into the United States is misguided   Of course  this is not only a vitally important issue for New York  but also for all of the States along the northern border  prompting a broad and bipartisan coalition of Senators to voice strong concerns about the impact of the Initiative on U S  businesses and citizens along the border                The administration has begun to walk back from its original strict passport requirement in recent months  suggesting that a new passport card and most recently  a daily pass for infrequent travelers  could be used as substitutes for a passport at the Canadian border   While the administration  s proposal demonstrates that they are starting to recognize how burdensome the provisions of the WHTI would be on our northern border families and businesses  I am still concerned that these new proposals do not do nearly enough to assure Americans that the administration is committed to easing the severe practical and economic hardships that the WHTI could have on northern border communities   Furthermore  these proposals are still very thin on details   Any alternative identification requirement must be sensible  easily obtainable  and affordable and must take into account the realities of life along the border   It must respond to the fact that many travel decisions are made without much forethought   For this reason  the alternative forms of identification must be acquirable without significant delay   These alternative forms of identification must also be affordable   Imposing a significant charge per identification on families    particularly those with minor children and infants    is not only impractical  but it does not address the affordability concerns posed by a passport only requirement          Likewise  the administration s proposal must take into consideration the economic impact of any identification requirement on northern States   The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed to New York officials that it did not conduct an economic analysis of a passport requirement before proposing the WHTI   To date  the DHS still has not published a cost benefit analysis of its proposal   Such an analysis is required of any  significant regulatory action   meaning an action with an economic impact of more than  100 million   Based on State Department estimates  the expense to citizens of purchasing new passports and identification documents alone will bring the impact of the Initiative to over  100 million   A bipartisan contingent of 21 members of the New York Congressional Delegation has written the Director of the Office of Management Budget urging him to designate the WHTI proposal a  significant regulatory action    The OMB should so designate the WHTI  and the Department of Homeland Security should conduct a long overdue cost benefit analysis of the WHTI to guide its consideration of identification requirements          Finally  Congress should not permit a new identification requirement at the border to proceed until the General Accounting Office or a similar body has an opportunity to complete an analysis of the economic impact the proposal will have on tourism and trade in this country   An identification requirement could have a massive impact on the economies and the communities of New York and other border states   The stakes of this proposal are far too high for us to march forward blindly without any knowledge of its economic impact             I look forward to examining closely the alternatives proposed by the Administration and am hopeful that we can find a solution that properly balances our mutual interest in a secure northern border with our desire to maintain communities that are both economically and socially vibrant
