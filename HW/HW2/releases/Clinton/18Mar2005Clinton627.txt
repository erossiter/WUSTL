March 18  2005 Senator Clinton Highlights Senate Budget Resolution Strengths and Weaknesses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Citing her continued grave concern about the devastating impact that the President s budget cuts will have on New York  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  today vowed to continue to build upon some of the progress that was made in the Senate Budget Resolution where some of the Bush Administration s most egregious cuts were restored  Senator Clinton worked with her colleagues throughout the week to beat back some of the Administration s cuts to critical health  education and community development programs          Make no mistake about it  the President s budget is an attack on working families and we must all continue to fight against it  While I am pleased that we were able to restore some of the cuts to critical programs like Medicaid  I remain deeply troubled by attempts to dismantle other vital programs  I am particularly disturbed by this Administration s determination to shut down Amtrak and hope that other state and local leaders will come to this vital service s side as well   Senator Clinton said         Several major initiatives that Senator Clinton and her colleagues succeeded in including in the final budget resolution are as follows              Medicaid    Senator Clinton co sponsored an amendment  along with Senators Smith  OR  and Bingaman  NM   that passed in the final resolution to restore a  15 billion cut in Medicaid nationally   2 billion for New York  The amendment also would create a bipartisan commission to recommend solutions to strengthen and reform Medicaid             Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  Program   This amendment will provide  2 07 billion in funding to restore the CDBG program and other critical aid programs for towns and cities that faced elimination under the President s Budget              Education    Senator Clinton co sponsored an education amendment that provides  773 7 million to restore the President s cuts to GEAR UP and TRIO  including  306 5 million for GEAR UP and  467 2 million for TRIO  Upward Bound   312 556 million  Talent Search   144 887 million  and other TRIO cut   9 710 million   This amendment restores college access services to over 1 8 million low income and first generation middle and high school students  including nearly 40 000 New York students              Flu Vaccine Shortage Prevention    The Senate adopted the Clinton Gregg  NH  amendment that will help prevent future flu vaccine shortages and strengthen flu tracking and response efforts              Comparative Effectiveness    Senator Clinton sponsored an amendment that was included in the budget resolution that will support comparative effectiveness research that compares the safety and effectiveness of new prescription drugs  medical treatments and devices to other similar treatments for the same illnesses and medical conditions  allowing patients and health care providers to make more informed decisions about their medical care  In addition to enhancing safety  comparative effectiveness studies improve quality and reduce costs that come from prescribing a drug or other medical procedure that may be more expensive and no more effective than other similar options  and could have negative health consequences that require additional treatment  hospitalizations  or other medical interventions that drive up costs        Senator Clinton said   It was a tough fight  but  ultimately  a majority of my colleagues joined me in making sure Medicaid  educational programs and other vital initiatives were included in the final passage of fiscal year 2006 Budget Resolution  We now must continue to fight for these programs in conference  Unfortunately there are also still many programs that the President has slashed or under funded and I hope that my Republican colleagues will work with us to address some of these misplaced priorities         Major amendments that were defeated by Senate Republicans and not included in the final budget resolution that Senator Clinton is committed to fighting for include             Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP     President Bush sharply reduced LIHEAP funding in his FY  06 budget with New York losing more than  28 million from last year s funding  Senator Clinton strongly supported an amendment that would restore those cuts  but it was defeated by the Republican majority              COPS Program    Under Bush s budget proposal  this program is reduced from  379 million to  118 million nationally  Additionally  absolutely no funding is proposed for the COPS Universal Hiring Program  the COPS MORE program  COPS in Schools program  or the COPS Interoperable Communications Technology Program  Senator Clinton cosponsored an amendment offered by the Senate Democrats that would have fully restored funding for this successful program  but was defeated              Veterans Healthcare    Under the President s proposal  the VA system is under funded by nearly  2 8 billion dollars  The Republican Senate defeated an amendment co sponsored by Senator Clinton that would have restored the funding and would have paid for this increased funding through closing corporate tax loopholes          LIHEAP and COPS are two major programs that are important to New Yorkers and I will continue to fight for federal funding   Senator Clinton said   Also  I am appalled that Congress would turn its back to our Veterans who risked their lives to serve our country  I will work to be sure more money is allocated to VA Healthcare
