July 14  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Today  s Comments by Secretary Chertoff on Transit Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    The millions of New Yorkers who use the subways  buses and ferries each day would be shocked and angered to hear today  s comments by Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff declaring that local governments are left to fend for themselves when it comes to paying for improved subway  train and bus security          The reality is that Americans should not be forced to choose between a safe airplane trip or a safe subway ride  Unfortunately  this Administration has presented us with a false choice    they would like us to believe that resources are so scarce that we can  t afford to fully protect all of our transportation systems  For the last few days  my colleagues and I have been on the Senate floor  forced to debate whether we should fund rail safety or bus safety  secure our borders or fund more airline screeners   This debate is necessary because this Administration has made the judgment that cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans is more important than fully meeting our nation  s security needs  This Administration  s priorities are clear  1 5 Trillion in tax cuts and only  30 billion for homeland security          So while I am outraged by Secretary Chertoff  s comments belittling the threats posed to our subways and buses  I am not surprised  He is simply giving voice to this Administration  s misguided and indefensible priorities  If the London bombings didn  t serve as a wakeup call to this Administration that they need to reevaluate their priorities  I am hard pressed to understand what will make them understand the gravity of the threat millions and millions of Americans face every single day when they step onto a bus or a subway or a ferry to go about their daily lives
