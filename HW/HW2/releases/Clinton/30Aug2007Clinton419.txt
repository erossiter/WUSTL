August 30  2007 Governor Spitzer and Senator Clinton Call on President Bush to Reverse Federal Policy Denying Health Care Coverage to Thousands of Uninsured Children                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Spitzer and Clinton Joined by Families Affected by Bush Action  Click here for audio  New York  NY   Governor Eliot Spitzer and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on President George W  Bush to remove burdensome rules instituted by his administration to deny approximately 60 000 New York children health care  They were joined by the families of children at risk of losing the health care they are set to receive through the state Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  on September 1 unless the President acts to reverse this new policy    In New York  SCHIP has been immensely successful in providing health insurance to the most vulnerable children  said Governor Spitzer  The state has made great strides in achieving a non partisan solution for providing universal coverage for every child  but the Presidents actions threaten to undo this good work and increase the ranks of the uninsured  Senator Clinton and I will continue to fight the battles that matter most  standing up for New Yorkers who work hard and play by the rules  yet still cannot afford health care for their children    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  who helped launch this program during the Clinton Administration has advocated for the expansion of the CHIP program in an effort to cover every child  also introducing legislation with Congressman John Dingell to provide access to affordable quality healthcare coverage to all uninsured children    We should not punish children and their families who need healthcare coverage  but that is exactly what the President is proposing  The President s policy would undermine efforts to provide healthcare for uninsured children and New York will be especially hard hit if the President s plan to scale back CHIP is not reversed  This Administration is looking right through millions of parents who are nervous that their children will get sick and they won t be able to afford the medical bills  Senator Clinton said  The actions of President Bush are not only an attempt to undermine and negate the bipartisan efforts of Congress  they are the actions of an Administration that does not see 8 7 million children without health care as a problem worth solving  I will continue to work with Governor Spitzer and my colleagues in Congress to make sure children and families in New York continue to benefit from this important program    In April  Governor Spitzer joined with large bi partisan majorities in the state legislature to enact a historic expansion of New Yorks CHIP program  known as Child Health Plus  CHIP is a joint federal state initiative to provide quality health care to children in families who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid  but not enough to afford private health insurance    The Child Health Plus expansion enacted into law would have allowed children in families making up to 400 percent of the poverty level to become eligible for the program  allowing nearly every one of New Yorks 400 000 uninsured kids to obtain health care  Coverage for newly eligible children was originally scheduled to begin on September 1     On August 17  2007  however  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  CMS   which administers CHIP  announced new rules governing the program  Among these were the requirement that until a state enrolls 95 percent of those eligible for CHIP in households making under 200 percent of the poverty line   41 300 for a family of four   they cannot provide coverage to children in families making above 250 percent of the poverty line   51 625 for a family of four   While all states aspire to cover every eligible child possible  no state has yet reached the 95 percent threshold  In New York  88 percent of such children are enrolled    CMS and the President have thus far not approved New York s State Plan Amendment nor rescinded these unfair rules so the State can begin its historic expansion of Child Health Plus on September 1  This means that unless they act  countless families across the state must continue to wait to get the coverage they deserve     Earlier this week  Governor Spitzer appeared with Congressman Charles Rangel to announce his intention to take legal action against CMS if they do not reverse their new rules governing the program  These rules contradict the provisions of the federal CHIP law and were imposed without notice or the required comment period as required by the federal Administrative Procedures Act  Yesterday  appearing at Childrens Health Day at the New York State Fair  the Governor announced a joint letter with California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to the President asking him to reverse these rules
