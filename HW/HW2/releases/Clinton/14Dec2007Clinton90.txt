December 14  2007 National 9 11 health Program Stopped in Its Tracks  NY Delegation Demands Immediate Answers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       New York  NY  Representative Carolyn B  Maloney  D NY   Senators Chuck Schumer  D NY  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   and Representatives Jerrold Nadler  D NY  and Vito Fossella  R NY  today demanded answers from Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Michael Leavitt on why his agency suddenly terminated its Request for Contracts to start a World Trade Center Business Process Center  full text of delegation letter to Leavitt below    The Business Process Center would have created the first federally funded national program to provide treatment for sick 9 11 responders who reside outside the New York metropolitan area   Currently  no such national treatment program exists  and if private funding runs out sick responders from around the country would be forced to travel to the New York City area to seek diagnosis and treatment      Its appalling the Administration would choose the weeks before Christmas to slap thousands of sick 9 11 responders with this shocking news  said Maloney   Brave responders from around our country have been counting on this program to finally get the health care they need and deserve        For far too long  the Administration has played games with the health needs of the brave men and women who toiled at Ground Zero  To pull the rug out from workers  whether they are from New York or otherwise  is simply unjustified and unfair  said Schumer      Following the devastation of the 9 11 terrorist attacks  thousands of responders came from all over the country to help New York in its time of need  Many of them are now suffering from illnesses as a direct result and it is our turn to make sure they receive the care they need  Withdrawing the request for proposals prior to the deadline effectively halts our planning to provide coordinated  comprehensive  federally funded treatment for responders outside of the New York City area  said Clinton  For those suffering from illnesses related to the aftermath of the attacks  time is of the essence and we simply cannot afford any additional delays in establishing a national federally funded treatment program  I strongly urge HHS to take all necessary steps to ensure that the people who selflessly responded in wake of the 9 11 tragedies have access to critically needed care    People came from every state in the nation to aide in the massive rescue and recovery effort at Ground Zero  and put their health at risk in doing so  said Nadler   The World Trade Center Business Process Center is a crucial piece in providing health care to the thousands of people across the country whose health was affected by 9 11   We have a moral obligation to the living victims of 9 11  and I urge the Administration to honor its commitment and move forward with this program    The news that HHS has pulled the plug on the World Trade Center National Business Center marks a sad chapter in our efforts to secure a full federal commitment to those people who are sick as a result f their work on 9 11   These questions now need to be answered  what will the alternative be  And what will the federal commitment be to these workers and volunteers   I cannot understand why when it is known that more centralized data on sick 9 11 workers nationwide is needed that they would pull the plug on the center that would have provided that    My colleagues and I will continue to fight for those who have become sick as a direct result of working at ground zero  regardless of where they live  said Fossella    Background    A July report by the independent Government Accountability Office  GAO  stated that many World Trade Center first responders dont have access to the thorough  uninterrupted health screening and monitoring services they need  and efforts to provide health screening and monitoring services to World Trade Center responders living outside of the New York City area are incomplete and intermittent   The GAO recommended that the Secretary of HHS expeditiously ensure that screening and monitoring services are available for responders residing outside the NYC area  Federally funded treatment and monitoring programs are currently in operation through a variety of care providers in New York and New Jersey  including Mt  Sinai Hospital  Bellevue Hospital and the FDNY   The Request for Proposal would have allowed NIOSH to begin to establish a program to provide uniform  high quality medical care to first responders nationwide   The full text of the letter follows    December 14  2007   The Honorable Michael O  Leavitt  Secretary  U S  Department of Health and Human Services  200 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20201   Dear Secretary Leavitt    We are very concerned that the Department of Health and Human Services has terminated the Request for Contracts to start a World Trade Center  WTC  Business Processing Center which would  among other tasks  administer the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program for responders who live outside the New York metropolitan area    Over six years after the attacks of 9 11  the health needs of all those who were exposed to the toxins of Ground Zero are still not being met   A series of grants set up the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment program to provide care for WTC rescue  recovery and cleanup workers in the New York metropolitan area  However  there is still no comprehensive federal program to care for the thousands of people currently living outside the metropolitan region who were exposed to the toxins of Ground Zero   These are people who came from every state in the nation and nearly every Congressional District in our country to help with the recovery efforts  In addition  a national program would serve those responders who were residents of the New York metropolitan area on 9 11  but have since moved or retired to other areas      The purpose of putting forth the Request for Contracts for the Business Process Center was to establish a coordinated  systematic mechanism for the treatment of these responders before existing funding streams for national treatment ends  which is expected to happen at some point next year  Without this Request  the process of establishing federally funded treatment opportunities for responders outside of the New York metropolitan area has been halted  and the process of transitioning from existing treatment to a coordinated program has ended  Canceling the request for contracts essentially puts an end to the hope that they can access the care they need on a long term basis in their area  without having to travel to New York     We have all been strong advocates for the treatment and monitoring programs that help those that responded to 9 11 get the essential care and treatment for the lingering health impacts resulting from the exposures they faced in their work  But we also strongly believe that access to this care should not be based upon where you live  Responders and rescue workers came from all over the nation to address the crisis faced in New York  and we should in turn make sure that treatment services are available in locations across the nation  As a result  we are surprised and disheartened that HHS summarily stopped the contracting process for a WTC Business Processing Center  particularly because of the effort that had been carried out on this issue by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health     In addition to establishing a mechanism for treatment  it is important to note that the Business Processing Center would allow data on injuries and costs to be compiled in a timelier manner  Such center would also help to coordinate data collection among entities receiving federal funding for 9 11 monitoring and treatment     With this in mind  we respectfully request to know    1       Why did HHS cancel the Request for Contracts for the WTC Business Processing Center   2       Who made the decision and who is ultimately responsible for the decision   3       When will a new request be issued   4       If you do not plan to issue a new request  why not     5       What alternatives do you plan in order to deliver the services these responders need across the country   6       Generally  what are the changes you are contemplating for the WTC Medical Monitoring and Treatment program for WTC responders   7       Specifically  how do you intend to collect and improve the data that lawmakers need in order to move forward with caring for WTC Responders  both in New York and around the country    Because of the urgency of this matter  we would like a response before Friday  December 21 at 5 00pm    Sincerely    CHARLES E  SCHUMER  United States Senator                         HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON  United States Senator  CAROLYN B  MALONEY  Member of Congress                             JERROLD NADLER  Member of Congress               VITO FOSSELLA  Member of Congress
