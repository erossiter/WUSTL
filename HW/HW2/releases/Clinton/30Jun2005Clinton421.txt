June 30  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Treasury Department  s Recommendation to end the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    I am deeply disappointed with the findings contained in the Treasury Department  s report regarding the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002    In the weeks and months following the attacks of September 11th  virtually every sector of our economy faced extreme uncertainty in the wake of the most devastating terrorist attacks in our nation  s history   It has been estimated that nearly  15 billion in real estate transactions and over 300 000 jobs  including many in New York  were put on hold due to the lack of terrorism insurance available          The Treasury Department  s call for removing terrorism risk insurance is careless at best and has the potential to put countless New York businesses in jeopardy   The administration  GAO and the federal reserve chairman have all acknowledged that TRIA has been instrumental in helping to get so many of New York  s businesses back on their feet   By ending the program the Administration would be pulling the rug out from under hundreds of institutions that depend on this critical safety net   With the enactment of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act  TRIA   Congress and the Administration had the wisdom to step in and ensure that a safety net was in place to adequately cover and insure properties against future attacks   This gave investors  developers and workers the economic confidence needed to ensure the stability of one of the most critical sectors of our economy   Indeed the last several years of growth in this industry  after one the most precarious economic situations in our nation  s history  proves that enacting TRIA was the right policy decision                                                                                                                                    It is particularly troubling that the Treasury Department has made this recommendation despite their own conclusion that TRIA has been effective in achieving its goals and supporting the many sectors of our economy that the insurance industry underwrites  While the Administration suggests that there would only be a   short lived adjustment in coverage and pricing    if TRIA were allowed to expire  there is a wide consensus that the disruption in coverage and its effect on economic growth would be severe            In a report issued last year  the GAO said that an adequate market for terrorism insurance would not exist if TRIA was allowed to expire     As a result  reinsurer and consequently  insurer  participation in the terrorism insurance market likely will decline significantly after TRIA expires           I hope that a permanent solution to the problem of terrorism insurance can be achieved with cooperation from both the public and private sector    I will continue to work with my colleagues  my constituents and the Administration to achieve that goal   Nevertheless  I firmly believe that the abrupt end to the TRIA program would be harmful to New York  s and the nation  s economy and that is why I will continue to work for its extension
