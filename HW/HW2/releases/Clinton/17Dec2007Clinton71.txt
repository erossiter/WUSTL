December 17  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Pardon of the  Girl of Qatif                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC  I welcome todays news that Saudi King Abdullah has pardoned the Girl of Qatif   This young woman was raped by seven men in an unconscionable attack last spring  Despite being the victim of this heinous crime  the Girl of Qatif was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison  This sentence was unjustifiable  and I am glad to see that it has been overturned  We cannot truly end the epidemic of violence against women unless we can end the silence and stigma that so often accompanies these crimes  and ensure that those who have experienced violent sexual assault are not blamed or jailed for what they have endured   I am pleased to note that the Saudi government has announced reforms to its legal system  and I encourage them to continue that process so that all Saudis  both men and women  have equal protection under the law    Senator Clinton  a longtime champion of womens rights around the world  previously expressed outrage at this sentence  and joined with several of her colleagues last week in introducing a resolution urging the Saudi government to overturn the sentence of the Girl of Qatif
