September 26  2006 Statement of Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  Charles Schumer  and Edward Kennedy on Help Chairman Enzi s Decision to Hold Hearing on 9 11 Health Illness Problems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC      We welcome Chairman Enzi  s announcement today that the Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee will conduct hearings on the crisis facing our police officers  firefighters  paramedics  trade and construction workers  residents  and others who responded to Ground Zero and Fresh Kills in the days following the September 11th attacks   We introduced the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2006    modeled after an amendment Senators Clinton and Schumer offered to the SAFE Port Act last week    that would authorize  1 9 billion in grants for ongoing medical and mental health treatment and monitoring for those exposed to the dust and toxins in the days  weeks  and months following the attacks   It is our hope that the HELP Committee will not only hold hearings but also mark up legislation that we can get to the President  s desk and enacted into law   Thanks to the scientific work conducted by the Mt  Sinai Medical Center  we know that there is a connection between illnesses in many of these heroes and their presence in the impacted area during those dark times   We must act swiftly   We cannot wait until more of these heroes become sicker or die   We will do everything we can to move this legislation forward and we look forward to working with Chairman Enzi to achieve our goal of making sure these individuals receive an appropriate level of support
