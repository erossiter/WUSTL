February 7  2005 Statement of Senator Clinton on the Bush Administration s FY2006 Budget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  issued the following statement in response to today s release of the Bush Administration s Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Proposal        In his newly proposed budget  the President hides the costs of his proposals but has no qualms about openly slashing funding for services vital to New York s security  health  and families  Though he leaves his far more expensive priorities intact  the President s budget dramatically cuts programs that support schools  hospitals  veterans  police hiring  the working poor  transportation infrastructure and our environment        The President says that he is in favor of fiscal responsibility  but a closer look at the details of his new budget proves that this is not true  Despite making significant cuts to programs important to New Yorkers  the President has elevated his priorities above the need for spending discipline and requested that Congress approve a budget that acknowledges a 2005 budget deficit of  427 billion  the largest in American history         This budget is the result of policies that have put our fiscal direction on an unsustainable course  When President Bush took office  the Congressional Budget Office  CBO  predicted that by 2011  we would have a budget surplus of  5 6 trillion  After four years of the Bush Administration  the CBO now predicts that we ll have a budget deficit of  2 58 trillion in 2011  And if we add in the costs of the President s new budget proposals  we will have a whopping  4 6 trillion deficit in 2011         While the President preaches fiscal responsibility and the goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009  his actions prove that his intentions lie elsewhere  In promoting his misplaced priorities  he seeks to cut funding for successful programs that directly benefit millions of New Yorkers  Even with these harmful cuts  however  the deficit would still grow dramatically as part of a budget plan that is simply not credible         The President s five year budget window masks the real costs of his priorities              The President s budget fails to account for most of the  1 6 trillion over ten years it would cost to make the tax cuts permanent  Most of the costs for those priorities come due after 2010  Because the budget deficit projections end in 2010  they don t show the true costs of his tax cuts             The President s budget fails to account for the  2 2 trillion it would cost to privatize Social Security over the next ten years              The President s budget fails to account for the cost of our continuing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan after 2005              The President s budget fails to account for the cost of appropriately fixing the Alternative Minimum Tax  Without an adjustment  many middle class households will see their tax burdens increase  Addressing this would cost  500 billion over the next decade  none of which is accounted for in the President s budget        The truth of the matter is that the President s policies are incompatible with the goal of cutting the deficit in half by 2009  The President has chosen the path of continued fiscal irresponsibility  and is willing to pass on its costs to our children and their children  Americans deserve better  It is possible to insist on a budget that is both fiscally responsible and that meets the needs and priorities of the American people  It is possible to invest in economic and social progress without creating unbearable debt         If the President insists on maintaining the course he has laid out in his deeply flawed budget  we in the Congress must do what it takes to send back to him a budget that restores both fiscal restraint and adequate funding for programs that meet the priorities and needs of New Yorkers and all Americans  I look forward to working with members of both parties to give the American people the budget they deserve
