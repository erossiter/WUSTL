                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Senator Says Devastating Cuts in Bush Budget Could Cost New York  28 Million in Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Senate Budget Committee to restore the Bush Administration s proposed cuts to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    Last month  President Bush sharply reduced LIHEAP funding in his FY  06 budget with New York losing more than  28 million from last year s funding  These federal dollars are a lifeline for low income families and elderly citizens in New York who are struggling to pay sky rocketing heating bills this winter    In a bipartisan letter sent to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  the Senator called for the restoration of the much needed funds  along with a provision to make them available earlier than usual  to enable states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in spring and early summer     These proposed cuts could not have come at a worse time  The storms that have blasted the region over the past few days are another bitter reminder to so many New Yorkers of the need for heating assistance   Senator Clinton said      If the President s Budget cuts are not restored  many low income New Yorkers will be left out in the cold   Senator Clinton said   On behalf of all the thousands of low income New Yorkers who could benefit from these federal dollars  I urge my colleagues to reverse the ill conceived cuts to this vital program     The President s fiscal 2006 budget proposes  1 8 billion in Fiscal Year 2006  for the regular LIHEAP program and  200 million for contingency funding   For Fiscal Year 2005  LIHEAP received  1 88 billion in regular funding and  297 6 million in contingency funding   The President s Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposes an  80 million  4 3 percent  decrease in regular funding and a  97 6 million  32 8 percent  decrease in contingency funding   This will mean a reduction in funding to New York of  11 million in regular funding  and using recent emergency funding allocations  a cut of nearly  17 million in emergency funding       A copy of the Senators  letter is attached    March 1  2005   The Honorable Judd Gregg     Chairman       Committee on the Budget    United States Senate     Washington  DC 20510        The Honorable Kent Conrad   Ranking Member    United States Senate     Washington  DC 20510    Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad    The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  provides a vital safety net for our nation s low income households   LIHEAP helps low income families and seniors remain healthy and secure from bitter cold winters in the North and hot summers in the South   We are writing to request that the budget provide  3 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal 2006 and that the allocation provide for advance appropriations for fiscal 2007   With  3 billion in regular funding and advance appropriations  LIHEAP can help working low income families  senior citizens  and disabled individuals maintain economic stability    For many low income families  disabled individuals  and senior citizens living on fixed incomes  home energy costs are unaffordable   These families often carry a higher energy burden than most Americans    spending up to 17 percent of their income on home energy bills   Each year  this burden grows as natural gas  heating oil and propane prices continue to increase       Since 1981  the number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance has grown   This winter  LIHEAP will serve an estimated 5 million households   Yet  this is only about 15 percent of the 32 million households that are eligible for federal assistance   We recognize the difficult choices that you face in shaping the fiscal 2006 budget resolution  however  we believe that the continued growth in households eligible for LIHEAP assistance demonstrates that the need for this program has never been greater   The LIHEAP program remains seriously underfunded   The program needs at least  3 billion simply to equal the purchasing power it provided in 1982     Energy is a basic need  and without LIHEAP assistance  low income families and senior citizens face the impossible choice between paying their home energy bills or affording other basic necessities such as prescription drugs  housing and food   The Boston Medical Center found that many poor children with chronic health conditions start to lose weight and suffer additional health problems associated with malnutrition in the winter because their families are spending less of their income on food and medicine and more on fuel bills   The National Energy Assistance Directors Association surveyed over 2 000 LIHEAP recipients on the choices made by households when faced with high energy bills   The survey found that in the last five years         38 percent of LIHEAP recipients went without medical or dental care        30 percent went without filling a prescription or taking the full dose of a prescribed medicine        28 percent did not make a rent or mortgage payment        22 percent went without food for at least one day  and       21 percent became sick because their home was too cold      We also request advance funding for LIHEAP   Advance funding enables states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in spring and early summer   Advance LIHEAP funding allows states to plan more efficiently and improve program management  and therefore  be more economical with limited Federal resources    It also ensures that states provide timely assistance to low income families who cannot afford to wait     Thank you for your consideration   We look forward to working with you to make sure that working families  seniors and disabled individuals have the resources necessary to provide for their basic energy needs     Sincerely
