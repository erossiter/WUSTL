July 25  2007 Senator Clinton to Offer Amendment to Continue TSA Ban on Butane Lighters Aboard Aircraft                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Clinton s Amendment Comes Amid New Reports of Heightened Security and Possible Terrorist Activity at Our Nation s Airports                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she plans to offer an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill  which is being considered on the Senate floor this week  which would effectively continue the ban on disposable butane lighters from being carried aboard aircraft  The Senators amendment to ban the lighters comes in response to the Transportation Security Administrations  TSA  recent announcement that disposable lighters would be allowed back on air flights as early as next month    Senator Clintons amendment would mandate the TSA to place disposable butane lighters on the TSA prohibited items list not allowed into airport sterile areas or onboard an aircraft until TSA provides to Congress a report identifying all anticipated security benefits and any possible vulnerabilities with lifting the ban on butane lighters and the GAO provides an assessment of TSAs report    I find the TSAs relaxation on their ban on lighters troubling because it would seem to be a step backward in our efforts to provide the flying public with the highest level of safety and security possible  said Senator Clinton  Not only does this policy directly contradict TSAs stance of 2005 in which they stated that  the threat posed by lighters on board is valid  but the FBI has reported that if the Shoe Bomber had been carrying a butane lighter  he would likely have been successful in detonating his bomb    There is absolutely no reason to rush to lift this ban  and since smoking is not permitted on U S  flights  there is no legitimate use for butane lighters onboard aircraft  While I fully support our continued efforts to reassess the threats posed to airline safety and security  until we are provided with a substantive report detailing what if any security benefits would be achieved from the relaxation of this policy  the TSA should not be so hasty to allow butane lighters on board planes again    The TSA recently announced that on August 4  2007 they will lift the ban on disposable butane lighters  The original ban on these lighters was included in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 after Richard Reid  also known as the Shoe Bomber  attempted to murder 197 people on board an American Airlines flight from Paris to Miami  when he unsuccessfully tried to set off explosives hidden in his shoes  using a box of matches   According to FBI and other law enforcement officials  Reid likely would have been successful had he used a butane lighter   The TSA based its recent decision to lift the ban on the argument that Transportation Security Officers  TSOs  could spend more time looking for high threat items like bombs or bomb parts  However  the TSA made a similar claim when they attempted to lift the ban on items such as small knives  six inch tools  scissors  and other items back onboard aircraft that were banned after the attacks of September 11  2001  Last year  Senator Clinton successfully sponsored an amendment that required the Comptroller General of the GAO to investigate the impact on public safety and the effectiveness of screening operations resulting from the TSAs decision  As a result of its investigation  the GAO concluded that TSOs spent on average  less than 1 percent of their time searching for those items that they had removed from the list and it may not have been accurate for the TSA to assume that lifting the ban would significantly free up TSOs resources   The GAO report also stated that it was not clear whether the change had any impact on the ability of TSOs to detect explosives  the key and stated goal of TSAs policy change    Last week Senator Clinton criticized the Transportation Safety Administration  TSA  for their decision to allow disposable butane lighters on board air flights starting next month  In a letter to the TSA  Senator Clinton questioned the decision and asked why  at a time of heightened security  the agency would be relaxing their ban on flammable cigarette lighters  Senator Clinton expressed her serious concerns about the decision and called on the TSA to reconsider it immediately
