November 29  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Future Status of Kosovo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            On December 10  the US EU Russian troika seeking a mutually acceptable settlement of the future status of Kosovo will make its report to the United Nations and to the world  Given the current position of the Russian government  it is unlikely that any agreement will be reached  If this is the case  I believe that further delay would be highly inadvisable  This process  which started far too late thanks to the neglect of the Bush Administration in its first term  has run its course  With Russia threatening to veto any arrangement submitted to the U N  Security Council  we must be prepared to strongly support the will of the majority of the people of Kosovo  If the government in Pristina decides for independence  I would strongly support prompt U S  recognition  and I would urge the European Union to do the same  I also congratulate the people of Kosovo on the orderly  peaceful election they have just completed  In supporting the independence of Kosovo  I want to stress the high importance that I attach to full protection of the rights of all minorities in Kosovo  especially the Serbs  This is an absolute necessity as Kosovo goes forward  I am also concerned about the deterioration of the situation in Bosnia  Twelve years after the Dayton Agreement ended that war  a combination of American neglect  European Union weakness  and Russian and Serbian obstructionism threatens the stability and future of Bosnia  I urge the Administration to pay more attention to this issue  so that it does not once again become a major threat to European stability  especially at the same time as the Kosovo situation approaches a historic juncture
