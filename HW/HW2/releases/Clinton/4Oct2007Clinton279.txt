               Washington  DC  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed approval by the full Senate of the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill  which includes  20 million for the Southern Tier  including  2 million for Binghamton Universitys Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing  CAMM    5 million for Dresser Rands Advanced Steam Turbine   4 million for L 3 Communications Predator Aircrew Mission Training System  PMATS  Upgrade  and  9 million for Rockwell Collins Global Air Traffic Management Program for KC 135s  The bill also includes  270 971 million  as requested in the Presidents Budget  for Lockheed Martins development of the new Marine One helicopter fleet    The bill will now proceed to a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between their versions  Following conference  the bill will again be sent to the House and Senate for final approval  after which it will be sent to the President for his signature    This Senate approval is wonderful news for the Southern Tier and a vital next step in the appropriations process  said Schumer  These federal funds will help us ensure that in defending our nation  we are equipped with the most cutting edge technology and know how  All of the institutions awarded here are doing research and work that will boost both our nations defense forces and the Southern Tier economy  And it demonstrates what I have always said  upstate New York has some of the best educated  highly skilled workers anywhere  I will continue to aggressively push this bill through the appropriations process    Approval of this bill by the Senate is wonderful news for the Southern Tier  and it is the next step in ensuring these key projects receive this important funding  As these local companies and institutions continue to build their capacity in support of our men and women in uniform  so too they build the reputation of the region and their own role in support of the local economy  This is an important investment in the Southern Tier for many reasons  not only are we supporting our troops serving overseas and at home  but we are also investing in local technology  local jobs  and the regions reputation for cutting edge research and development  Senator Clinton said    Binghamton University  Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing  CAMM     2 Million Funding will be used to continue development of new  flexible and low cost electronics based on roll to roll  R2R  manufacturing technologies to enhance U S  military superiority  while strengthening our nations role as a global technology leader  Advancements in the underlying materials and manufacturing technology for flexible  organic and printed electronics components and devices are critical for visionary applications related to the military and to national security   Extensive communications capability  enhanced power sources  extensive sensors deployment for threat detection and health monitoring  and active body armor and camouflage will prove important to the future warfighter  These developments are critical to make the future warrior more mobile  more lethal and more secure   Dresser Rand  Advanced Steam Turbine    5 Million Funding will be used to develop a steam turbine that can be used on the existing Virginia Class and future submarines  which will meet or exceed the capability of the existing steam turbine   This advanced turbine is estimated to reduce the cost the Navy is paying today by as much as 40 percent  and through improved efficiencies will provide the Navy a turbine with more Effective Full Power Hours  EFPH  during its life   L 3 Communications  Predator Aircrew Mission Training System  PMATS  Upgrade    4 Million The United States Air Force has fielded Predator Unmanned Aerial Vehicles operating in combat today  and is now fielding its first major upgrade  the MQ 9 Reaper  This project will build a Predator Aircrew Mission Training System simulator for the Reaper   Funding will help to upgrade engineering  performance  visual system and sensors   Rockwell Collins  Global Air Traffic Management Program for KC 135s    9 Million Aircraft equipped with the required systems will have the operational advantage of choosing the most efficient and economical routes of flight  as well as continued access to airspace that is now regularly used in DoD world wide operations   While operational access to airspace was important to address the military commitments of the 1990s  it has now reached a critical stage as the U S  faces new challenges   It is imperative that the U S  is capable of projecting airpower to any location via the most direct route   This is fundamental to having combat crews reach the target area with the most fuel and in the least fatigued condition possible   Lockheed Martin   VH 71A Executive Helicopter Development    270 971 Million  As requested in the Presidents Budget  A new Marine One helicopter fleet is needed  as todays security environment requires urgent upgrades to the presidential fleets security and defensive systems   The current VH 3D fleet has been in service for thirty plus years and is now at the end of its useful life  and also has insufficient payload capacity that will not allow the installation of additional communication and defensive equipment   The FY08 budget request of almost  271 million will ensure the aircraft test program remains on track and that the program will meet its plan of delivering five aircraft with Initial Operating Capability  IOC  in late 2009  and eighteen Fully Operation Capable aircraft in 2015  Full funding of the FY08 budget request of is required to keep the program on schedule
