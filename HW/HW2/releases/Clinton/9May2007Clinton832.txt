May 9  2007 Defense Secretary Unclear if War Authorization Still Applies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Asked if 2002 Resolution Still Valid  Responds  I Don t Know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    U S  Secretary of Defense Robert Gates today testified that he did not know whether the 2002 resolution allowing the use of force against Iraq is still relevant                  U S  Senator Robert C  Byrd  D W Va   who asked Gates about the 2002 resolution at a Senate hearing Wednesday  was surprised by the answer                   Secretary Gates  the 2002 resolution authorized the president to use force in Iraq for two purposes   The first was to defend the national security of the United States  against the continuing threat posed by Iraq    The second was to  enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions against Iraq    Byrd said    Since the government of Saddam Hussein no longer exists  and has been replaced by a democratically elected government  do you agree that this authorization no longer applies to the ongoing conflict in Iraq                    I think the honest answer  Senator Byrd  is that I don t know the answer to that question   Gates responded                    While Secretary Gates  candor is refreshing  I m troubled by his answer   If the Secretary of Defense doesn t know what legislation is guiding his operations in Iraq  perhaps it is time for President Bush to take another look at what is really happening in Iraq   The situation on the ground in Iraq today in no way reflects the sales job that President Bush sold to the American people in 2002   Byrd said after the hearing    The Secretary s honesty makes the case very clear that the 2002 resolution has run its course  and it is time for a new approach                   Byrd and New York Senator Hillary Clinton  both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee  have proposed ending the 2002 use of force resolution at its five year anniversary  on October 11  2007   Byrd and Clinton would give President Bush the opportunity to return to Congress to make the case for the  new mission  in Iraq  a mission that Congress and the American people would then have to approve                   Secretary Gates  statement today that he  doesn t know  if the 2002 resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq is still valid is a clear example of the need to sunset the original resolution   The 2002 resolution has run its course  the voices of Congress and the American people should be heeded  and the President should change course in Iraq   Senator Clinton stated                   The 2002 use of force resolution is seriously outdated   It is time to throw that old resolution away  and give Congress and the American people a chance to debate and decide on the future presence of our military in Iraq   Byrd said               Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
