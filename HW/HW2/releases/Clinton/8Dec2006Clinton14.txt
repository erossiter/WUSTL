December 8  2006 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Genocide in Darfur                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr  President       The crisis in Darfur demands a more robust response  In July 2004  more than two years ago  the United States Senate declared genocide in Darfur  As the crisis has continued  as the death toll has mounted  it was hard to believe that the situation on the ground could deteriorate further  Unfortunately  it has  and the realities today are even worse than they were in July 2004       As many as four million civilians have been uprooted from their homes  and by some accounts 400 000 people have been killed  Countless women and young girls are being violently and sexually abused  Escalating violence is forcing the evacuation of many vital relief workers  These realities are well documented  We have U N  reports  State Department reports  reports from our colleagues who have traveled to the region  and countless other reports that tell us what has happened  what is happening  and who may be responsible       In the face of this crisis  the response of many citizens  officials  relief workers  and journalists has been impressive and inspiring  Their courageous efforts are testimony to the great work that can be done by individuals who act on their moral duty to end atrocities       The Senate also has taken important steps  We have provided funding to African Union peacekeepers and to humanitarian workers  we have urged NATO assistance  we have encouraged the establishment of a no fly zone  we have supported sanctions against the perpetrators of violence  we have established Presidential accountability by requiring regular reports on Darfur  and we have demanded the appointment of a Presidential Envoy to Sudan  We must continue to shine a spotlight and to take action wherever possible       But  like many of my constituents  I am disturbed that the killings and rapes and violence continue  I fear that our efforts and those of many Americans are not being complemented by equal efforts from our President  I again urge the Administration to be more proactive  and to turn the tables on Khartoum        Khartoum repeatedly has committed to disarm the Janjaweed  In fact  the Government of Sudan committed to do so long ago  in the summer of 2004  To date  this promise remains unfulfilled  And this Spring  Sudanese officials said that U N  peacekeepers would be allowed into Darfur once a peace deal was agreed  This commitment has been broken also  These abandoned promises may not be surprising in light of Khartoum  s long history of intransigence  What  s astonishing is that Khartoum has faced few consequences for these massive failures  and worse  that Khartoum still is being allowed to dictate the terms of peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts in Darfur       I implore the Administration to learn from this grim history  and to get one step ahead of the leaders in Khartoum  We must prepare for all scenarios  not just those we seek       Going forward  our agreements with Khartoum must include some   teeth    to incentivize compliance  We should remind Khartoum that we already have good records of the crimes committed in Darfur and of the suspected perpetrators  We also should pursue without delay all points of pressure that have been authorized by the U N  Security Council  We must demonstrate to Khartoum that continued intransigence will be more painful than cooperation       As we pursue these measures with Khartoum  we should remind rebel groups that they will be held accountable for violations of international law  In addition  we should work urgently with partners to stabilize eastern Chad and the Central African Republic       I suspect that history will pass exacting judgment on all parties who have acted insufficiently to end the suffering in Darfur  But history is a long way off for the people of Darfur  and I will continue to work urgently with colleagues towards peace in Sudan and the region  I urge the President to work more proactively to end this unconscionable crisis       Thank you
