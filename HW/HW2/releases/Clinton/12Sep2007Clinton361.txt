           Washington  DC   U S  Senators Charles E  Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced Senate Passage of the Transportation  Housing and Urban Development  and Related Agencies  TTHUD  FY08 Appropriations Bill  which includes  200 000 for the City of Newburghs Armory District Revitalization Plan   1 million for the replacement of buses in the Westchester County Bee Line Bus System   1 million for the City of Poughkeepsie Transit Hub  and  400 000 for the Haverstraw Ferry Terminal The bill will now proceed to conference     This is great news for the Hudson Valley and another important hurdle in the appropriations process  Schumer said   The Newburgh project will revitalize and restore the Armory District  fueling the exciting economic development taking place in that wonderful Hudson River city   The new environmentally friendly bus fleet in Westchester puts that county at the cutting edge of environmentally sound mass transit  The improved ferry operations in Haverstraw supports a vital new transportation option for Rockland County commuters  And the new transit hub for Poughkeepsie will significantly improve commuting services for Dutchess County and the whole Hudson Valley    The Senates passage of this bill is another important step in securing funds for these projects in the Hudson Valley  These funds for the Revitalization Planning and Development of Newburghs Armory District will further assist with the redevelopment of their facilities  helping to improve the neighborhood both physically and economically  I am pleased that the funds for the Poughkeepsie Transit Hub will facilitate the construction of a centralized public transit center that will help to alleviate disruptive traffic congestion and promote public transportation that can reduce harmful green house gas emissions   Much needed support will be provided for the Westchester County Department of Transportation Bee Line Bus System to replace out dated buses that will decrease emissions  and give residents a cleaner  greener ride  Senator Clinton said   The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal will receive funds to increase parking capacity  improve passenger waiting facilities  and increase access from Manhattan   which will greatly contribute to the economic growth of the area and relieve congestion    The City of Newburghs Armory District Revitalization Planning and Development program will receive  200 000 of federal funds to be used for planning and design efforts within the Citys Armory District   Implementation will include corridor planning utilizing the principles of urban design  the development of architectural designs  and mixed use commercial development planning   The support of this initiative via the Economic Development Initiative  EDI  will aid the redevelopment of this deteriorating corridor   Coordinating and planning the improvement for this corridor will help ensure economic vitality and neighborhood restoration  as well as support current and future private rehabilitation occurring in the corridor   Newburgh is located in Orange County    The Westchester County Department of Transportation Bee Line Bus Systems Low Emission ADA Accessible Replacement Buses project will receive  1 million of federal funds to replaces buses to decrease emissions   Westchester County proposes the replacement of 114 over age buses in the County public transit fleet  30 of which are not ADA accessible   This money will fund busses ordered in 2006 through 2008  to be delivered in 2007 through 2009    The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal will receive  400 000 of federal funds to upgrade the ferry service to Lower Manhattan   The Haverstraw Ferry Terminal currently serves the Haverstraw Ossining ferry  and will serve the Haverstraw Yonkers Lower Manhattan ferry service in the near future   Currently  there are limited parking and waiting facilities available at the site for passengers   These funds will be used to make parking and landside improvements  such as a climate controlled facility large enough to accommodate up to 100 passengers   When it is time for the ferry to move to their future  permanent home  several years from now   the passenger waiting facility structure can be relocated    The City of Poughkeepsie Transit Hub will receive  1 million of federal funds to build a combination Public Transit Hub and Parking Deck in the central business district to serve as a hub for city  county and private bus riders and provide resident parking   The City of Poughkeepsie is in the planning stages for a Public Transit Hub to be located on a City owned surface parking lot in the central business district  The structure will serve two much needed purposes by providing parking to residents and visitors and by serving as a transportation hub for bus riders on city  county  and intercity privately operated bus services   This project combines transit and economic development components  The first floor of the facility will serve the bus systems and their riders  and the upper floors will provide public parking spaces in support of the City s revitalization and redevelopment of the Luckey  Platt Building  the center piece of Main Street redevelopment efforts and a National Historic Landmark  The 150 000 square foot building is currently being redeveloped by private owners as a mixed retail market rate residential project    The bus systems and their riders are in dire need of a convenient and suitable location for downtown riders to wait for a bus or to transfer to another bus  Currently  riders must assemble at an on street transfer point bus stop  The current location does not accommodate the number of buses that are at that location during peak times  and riders have to wait at the curb or in a limited number of bus shelters   Within the Hub  the ground floor of the facility will house the transit hub with covered spaces for passengers and buses to enter  wait  and exit  Bus service will be maintained at its current location  but the transfer point for all buses will become the Transit Hub  Shuttle bus service from the Transit Hub to the Metro North and Amtrak Station may be an option as the City redevelops  Buses from the City Bus system  the Dutchess County Loop bus system  and regional intercity bus services will use the facility   Now that the bill has been passed by the House and Senate individually  it will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature
