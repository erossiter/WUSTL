December 21  2007 Senator Clinton Introduces  Second Responder  Legislation to Train and Integrate Construction Workers in Disaster Response Efforts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that she has introduced legislation to establish a comprehensive national system for skilled construction workers to assist first responders in response to natural and man made disasters and terrorist attacks   The legislation will train  certify  register  and integrate skilled construction workers into disaster preparedness and response activities  and establish a database that federal  state and local governments can use to identify and mobilize this workforce for disaster response activities      Construction workers were some of the unsung heroes after the September 11 attacks  said Senator Clinton   These workers have risked their lives to volunteer at Ground Zero and other disaster sites  including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the Minneapolis bridge collapse   However  we have learned that we can do a better job of training  mobilizing  and integrating this workforce into response activities   This legislation will create a national system of trained construction workers who stand ready to serve their country as second responders in the event of a disaster or terrorist attack    We commend Senator Clinton for introducing this legislation to provide increased training assistance to  second responders   said Mark H  Ayers  President of the Building  Construction Trades Department  AFL CIO   For over 100 years  Americas building trades unions  along with our contractor partners who jointly administer our apprenticeship and training programs  have been the leaders in providing unsurpassed skills training and technical education in the construction industry   Unfortunately  the times in which we now live require a new  equally important level of skills training that pertains to disaster response   As was so vividly clear at the scene of the World Trade Center collapse on 9 11  the men and women of the skilled trades play an important role in rescue and recovery operations   Senator Clinton s bill is the right step towards insuring that these skilled workers have the necessary training and skills  that they are certified and registered  and that the government then has the capacity to quickly mobilize this workforce in the event of a catastrophe    Construction craft workers provide critical skills in support of first responders at disaster sites  including demolition  electrical and pipeline maintenance  hazardous waste clean up  equipment operations  and traffic control   They also bring essential equipment  such as welding machines  backhoes  cranes  and dozers   These skilled workers volunteered at Ground Zero in the immediate aftermath of September 11  as well as in the Gulf Region in the aftermath of Hurricane Rita and Katrina  and a number of other disaster sites      However  a lack of coordination and training impeded the efforts to integrate the workers into the disaster response efforts   There is currently no system in place to mobilize this workforce or ensure the safe and effective integration of construction craft workers with first responder operations   There is also no system to ensure that these workers have the health and safety training and equipment they need to work at disaster relief sites   This bill  the Skilled Trades Second Responder Act of 2007  will address this need by creating a national system and registry of trained construction workers to be integrated into first responder disaster relief efforts
