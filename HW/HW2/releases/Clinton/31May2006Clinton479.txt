May 31  2006 Senator Clinton Presses for Fair Share of Ryan White Funding for New York                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Calls on Senate Leadership to Postpone Vote on Ryan White CARE Act Reauthorization Until Funding Issues Addressed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to postpone consideration by the full Senate of legislation to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE Act  legislation that provides essential funding for AIDS care and treatment programs  until concerns around funding for New York State  among other issues  are satisfactorily addressed  As the bill is currently written  it would result in losses of approximately  17 6 million to New York State in the first year of reauthorization  with losses increasing to  26 3 million in the second year of reauthorization  and  35 1 million in the third year  Senator Clinton voted against the bill when it was considered in the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee earlier this month            It is unacceptable that the reauthorization of the Ryan White CARE Act could result in a significant loss of funding for New York and many other states that have traditionally borne the brunt of this epidemic  jeopardizing our ability to continue providing high quality care and treatment services to people living with HIV and AIDS     Senator Clinton said    I am committed to working with my colleagues in Congress to make sure that New York gets its fair share of funding   We must ensure that New York will be able to maintain the level of high quality services it currently provides  and continue to be a model of HIV care for other states in the nation             Preliminary estimates indicate that the losses in this bill would have a devastating impact on the state  s current system of HIV AIDS health care delivery   If these cuts were to be enacted  New York  s Title II AIDS Drugs Assistance Program would likely have to reduce coverage for multiple classes of drugs  including those that treat HIV associated opportunistic infections  Approximately 4 000 people would be in danger of losing access to community based case management services  while another 3 000 would be in danger of losing access to mental health services          In the proposal marked up by the Senate  New York State would be penalized for adhering to federal requirements to establish a comprehensive system of care based on an actual and accurate count of HIV and AIDS cases  while states that have not yet instituted such systems would be allowed to use estimates of HIV AIDS cases which may result in significant overestimates of their actual HIV AIDS cases   In essence  the significant commitment of New York in providing state and local resources to address HIV and AIDS will result in the loss of millions of dollars           New York has over 100 000 people living with HIV and AIDS  more than any other state in the nation  and the need for services continues to grow  Every year  over 6 000 new HIV cases are diagnosed  and the number of new AIDS cases reported in 2004 increased by 15 percent over the previous year  In New York  the epidemic disproportionately impacts minority populations  who account for 75 percent of the HIV AIDS cases in the state   Women are increasingly affected by the epidemic  and account for about one third of all new AIDS cases diagnosed in New York           Senator Clinton has been working to increase access to care for people living with HIV AIDS in New York and around the world   She has introduced the Early Treatment for HIV Act with Senator Gordon Smith  which would allow states to expand Medicaid eligibility to low income  uninsured and non disabled HIV positive individuals below 100 percent of the poverty line  allowing patients to obtain life saving  life extending treatment and services  As a member of the Senate Global AIDS Taskforce  she also is committed to increasing the resources available to fight this epidemic in the rest of the world  and supports allocating full funding to the President  s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  PEPFAR   and increasing our nation s contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria          The text of Senator Clinton  s letter to Senators Frist and Reid follows           The Honorable William Frist  M D    Majority Leader    SH 509      United States Senate  Washington  D C  20510      The Honorable Harry Reid  Minority Leader  SH 528  United States Senate  Washington  D C   20510      Dear Senators Frist and Reid       Since 1990  the Ryan White CARE Act has helped provide support for AIDS care and treatment programs throughout our country   This month  S  2823  legislation which would reauthorize this act  was reported out of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee   However  several outstanding issues  including concerns regarding funding  remain unresolved   The current version of the bill will result in significant losses for New York and many other states that have traditionally borne the brunt of this epidemic  thus jeopardizing our ability to continue providing high quality care and treatment services to people living with HIV and AIDS           I voted against the bill in committee because I believe that the funding cuts now proposed in the legislation would have a devastating impact upon the people of New York   Preliminary estimates indicate that the losses in this bill would have a devastating impact on the state  s current system of HIV AIDS health care delivery   If these cuts were to be enacted  New York  s Title II AIDS Drugs Assistance Program would likely have to reduce coverage for multiple classes of drugs  including those that treat HIV associated opportunistic infections  Approximately 4 000 people would be in danger of losing access to community based case management services  while another 3 000 would be in danger of losing access to mental health services   Half of our state  s Ryan White HIV care networks  which link local providers with the state health department to coordinate services in communities  would be eliminated  These care and treatment services are essential elements of health care for people living with HIV and AIDS  and I cannot support any bill that would limit access to needed health and supportive services for New Yorkers living with HIV and AIDS           Because of these concerns  I would ask that you not bring this legislation to the Senate floor prior to this bill being marked up by the House Energy and Commerce Committee  in order to give us time to work within the bipartisan bicameral process and come to resolution around both funding and other outstanding issues          Thank you for your consideration          Sincerely yours     Hillary Rodham Clinton
