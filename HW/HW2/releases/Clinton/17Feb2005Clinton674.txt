February 17  2005 Clinton  Schumer Call on FAA to Address Staff Deficiencies at Air Traffic Control Facilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC    United States Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E  Schumer today called on the Federal Aviation Administration to immediately address reports of staffing deficiencies at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control  NYTRACON  facility      It is imperative that our air traffic control facilities are adequately staffed so that we can ensure our air transportation system meets the tightest possible safety standards   We must carefully assess any budget tightening measure such as this one to be absolutely sure that safety is not negatively affected   Senator Clinton said         The air traffic controller system is in crisis   Everyone knows that   This new rule is shocking  we are squeezing the already invaluable resource   well trained experienced air traffic controllers   to the breaking point  There is no reason to set this arbitrary limit   It puts millions of traveler s lives in danger and I call on the FAA to stop it   said Senator Schumer      A copy of the Senators  letter to Administrator Blakey is below    February 16  2005   The Honorable Marion Blakey    Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20591   Dear Madam Administrator    We write regarding the current staffing crisis at the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control  NYTRACON  facility   It is our understanding that the facility is staffed only at 77  and that recent policies enacted by the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  in which overtime has been curtailed is further exacerbating an already dangerous situation   We believe that the staffing situation poses a threat to the flying public and we ask for your immediate attention to the matter                 The NYTRACON has supplemented its staffing through the use of overtime which has allowed the facility to meet minimum operational requirements   However  on January 12  2005  the Acting Facility Manager issued a memorandum changing the policy for overtime approval   This is resulting in congested frequencies  an increase in operational errors  controller training being suspended  and safety being compromised                You stated in your Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan that   if the FAA is not able to adequately staff its air traffic control facilities  the system response will be observed in the area of system capacity not system safety    In 2004  while using overtime as a means to supplement staffing shortfalls  the overall operational error rate dropped by 10 percent   Yet  now only one month after the manager issued the new rule limiting the use of overtime  operational errors have started to mount                  While safety is the responsibility of all participants in the nation s air transportation system  the FAA s air traffic controller workforce manages millions of commercial  military  and general aviation aircraft operations daily   Because controllers face extreme pressure and stress every minute of their work day  the policies of the federal government must be consistent with easing that burden while meeting the demands of the flying public   Many facilities  especially the NY TRACON  require additional staffing but until full time hiring is complete  overtime is one of the few resources available to ease the mounting pressures on existing controllers                  We would appreciate a response from you on this specific issue as soon as possible as we are concerned about the increase in incidents since the beginning of 2005 and the potential for future issues as air traffic increases   If you  or your staff  have any questions please do not hesitate to contact Sean O Shea in Senator Clinton s office at  202  224 4451 or Joshua Vlasto in Senator Schumer s office at  202  224 4960   We thank you for your time and attention to this important matter    Sincerely                   Charles E  Schumer                                                 Hillary Rodham Clinton
