                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Senator Reaffirms Strong Bonds Between U S  and Israel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Spring Valley  NY   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was honored as a guest speaker at the Hudson Valley Political Action Committee s  HUVPAC   23rd Annual Dinner on Sunday night  September 25th  at the Atrium Plaza in Spring Valley  NY   The Hudson Valley Political Action Committee  HUVPAC  is a bi partisan organization and supports candidates in federal elections who are supportive of the US Israel relationship   Senator Clinton praised HUVPAC for the work its members do to bring essential US Israel issues to the fore        HUVPAC Founder  Dr  Mendy Ganchrow  when introducing Senator Clinton told the crowd    I remember during the campaign of 2000  then candidate Clinton and I exchanged letters  I wanted to make sure she understood all of the issues that we at HUVPAC were concerned about  Today  Senator Clinton  s knowledge of Israel  her command of the issues and the facts surrounding Israel and the Middle East are impeccable  She has a 100  perfect record on Israel  and we are delighted she is with us tonight           During her speech  Senator Clinton reiterated her commitment to supporting Israel insisting   that a strong  lasting  profoundly supportive relationship between the United States and Israel is essential to our efforts to try to secure peace and stability     She also noted that America  s   future is obviously intertwined with and in many ways dependent upon the future of Israel      She described the connections between Israel and the U S  as based on a shared vision of democracy    the bonds between Israel and the United States are more than mere shared interests  They  re more than strategic interests  They are bonds that have been forged in account of struggle  for human rights  for democracy  for freedom  These are bonds that predate the creation of the State of Israel  that really predate the creation of the United States  because I would argue they are rooted in fundamental beliefs and values about the dignity and rights of men and women to live in freedom  free from fear and free from oppression  There is no doubt in my mind that these incredibly strong bonds and values will remain as the lodestar of our relationship with our democratic ally and friend Israel  Because Israel is not only a friend  not only a strategic partner and ally  it is a beacon  It is an example about what democracy can and should mean           Senator Clinton also discussed the ramifications of Israel  s recent disengagement from Gaza and called on the Palestinian Authority to dismantle the structures of terror that have been employed for too long     President Abbas must be held accountable for any and all actions that take place under his leadership  The disengagement has shown a bright spotlight on the Palestinian people and their leadership  The excuses have had to end  They now have responsibility for Gaza  The world will see whether they are capable of exercising responsible leadership  Will they be able and willing to pursue a path of peaceful coexistence  Or will they be overrun by the extremists and the terrorists  whose only vision of the future is the destruction of Israel  Will they build roads and infrastructure or will they loot buildings  greenhouses and synagogues  Will they develop trade missions and exchange with their neighbors or will they have an unchecked and compromised border with Egypt that does not screen entrance for the kinds of weapons and other means of destruction that they may wish to bring in   These questions are all squarely the responsibility of President Abbas           Senator Clinton called upon the Palestinian and European leaders to take responsibility for ending violence in the Middle East  especially in urging the Palestinians to end the incitement of violence    I would call on the Europeans to do even more   it is time for them to pressure the Palestinians to exercise responsible and accountable leadership  There are several ways to do that  Number one  no aid should be given unless it is conditioned upon the end of the terrorists   structure and the infrastructure   Number two  the continuing incitement of hatred  anti Semitism  The incitement must end and no aid and no support should flow to the Palestinians unless they once and for all take steps to end that incitement through their textbooks and their media            Particularly disturbed by the use of inflammatory rhetoric to incite violence in children  Senator Clinton declared   When it comes to children  those children are like any children  they should be shielded from hate  not covered with it  not given it as a means to see the world and in fact by making those children vehicles of that hatred  it was a form of child abuse and it was something that they needed to accept responsibility for because of what they were doing to their own children   Using children as pawns in that kind of hate filled campaign needs to be condemned universally           Issuing a very clear warning about other areas in the Middle East  Senator Clinton also spoke about the threat of an Iran armed with nuclear weapons saying    a nuclear armed Iran would shake the foundations of global security to its very core
