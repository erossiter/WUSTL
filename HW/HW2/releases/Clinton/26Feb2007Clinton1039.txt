February 26  2007 Statement of Hillary Rodham Clinton on Department of Transportation Pilot Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    The Bush Administration s announcement that the Department of Transportation  DOT  is forging ahead with a pilot program that would open our U S  highways to Mexican trucking companies is deeply troubling  particularly in light of the fact that the DOT s own Inspector General intends to release a congressionally mandated report in the coming months that closely examines whether the program had met safety and security requirements   An earlier 2005 DOT Inspector General report confirmed that the Administration had failed to meet a number of strict congressional guidelines aimed at protecting the American driving public          The Administration s decision to move forward with this pilot program without confirmation that these issues have indeed been adequately addressed once again exhibits a disregard for the laws and the safety of our nation   The Administration s mere assurances that these safety requirements have been satisfied are not enough   I applaud Senator Patty Murray  Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation  for convening a hearing on March 8 to examine whether the safety requirements have been met  and I will be monitoring the situation closely in the coming weeks to ensure that the Administration s rush to judgment does not ignore important questions about the safety of the program
