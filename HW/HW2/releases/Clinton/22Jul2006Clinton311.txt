July 22  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Institute of Medicine Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement on the Institute of Medicine Report   Preventing Medication Errors     which found that on average a hospital patient is subject to at least one medication error each day and that each year  at least 1 5 million people have a preventable adverse drug event   According to the report  these errors are estimated to cost the United States  3 5 billion each year            The Institute of Medicine has issued yet another wake up call that cannot go unheeded   Despite the fact that we spend almost  2 trillion each year on health care  patient safety and quality continue to get short shrift   The sad fact is that neglecting patient safety and quality is costing us  in money and in lives   We need to get serious about addressing these problems and a key part of this effort must be harnessing the power of information technology            To maximize the benefits of health IT    to reduce medical errors  improve quality  reduce costs and protect privacy    there must be one set of national standards   I have introduced legislation  approved by the Senate  to create a national framework for health information technology to ensure that as physicians  medical centers and other providers adopt technology  it  s compatible and interoperable   Now  we have different systems popping up all over the country that are unable to talk to each other and unable to maximize the quality and cost savings potential          As part of this effort  we also need a clear and uniform standard for e prescribing so that physicians  pharmacists and medical centers are speaking the same language   An important first step would be to correct the 2003 Medicare law   Instead of using the market power of the Medicare program to drive the use of one  national e prescribing standard  the Medicare law was implemented to apply only to the Medicare population   As a result  we now have a variety of state e prescribing laws and another standard for Medicare  making life more complicated for physicians and minimizing the potential of e prescribing to save money and improve patient safety          I will continue to press for the House to act and approve health IT legislation so that we can move forward on getting health IT legislation enacted   I will also work in the Senate to create one nationwide standard for e prescribing so we can address the serious problem highlighted in the IOM report and fully realize its patient safety potential   By marrying technology and quality  we can achieve the goal of preventing medical errors and lowering health care costs
