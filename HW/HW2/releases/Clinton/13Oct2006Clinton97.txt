October 13  2006 Senator Clinton Calls for Action to Help Students at Lower Manhattan Schools Following 9 11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Illnesses and Problems Experienced by Recent Graduates of Stuyvesant High School Only Add to Concerns About Contaminants and Air Pollution Released During the World Trade Center Collapse   Senator Renews Call for EPA to Test and Clean Up Buildings Including Residences  Offices and Schools that were Affected by WTC Dust                                                                        New York  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is calling on the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to conduct a new testing and clean up program in New York to make sure that apartments  businesses and schools are not contaminated with dangerous toxic materials from the World Trade Center  Recent reports of illnesses affecting Stuyvesant High School students have added to concerns about the debris and toxins that were spread across parts of the city following the collapse of the World Trade Center towers          Senator Clinton  who has been pushing the EPA to test and clean apartments  workplaces and other buildings following the attacks  and has fought to secure vital funding for workers  residents and first responders who are now sick and dying  has written to the EPA  asking them again to commit to a comprehensive testing and clean up program that can identify and eliminate any remaining contamination and can assure New Yorkers that their schools  offices and homes are safe          In a letter to EPA Regional Administrator Alan J  Steinberg  Senator Clinton noted that   Recent graduates of Stuyvesant High School  which is located near the World Trade Center  have come forward to talk about their health and the conditions in their school after September 11   One student noted that the building smelled of smoke for months  another complained of increased asthma attacks  and one student has tragically contracted Hodgkins disease               This is an issue that should have been addressed long ago   The collapse of the World Trade Center propelled debris and toxins across lower Manhattan and as far away as Brooklyn   In many nearby buildings  windows were blown out  and layers of dust accumulated in interior spaces   In other buildings  dust entered through open windows or through ventilation systems     the Senator s letter continued            The recent reports about Stuyvesant High School underscore the fact that the threat of indoor contamination is still a pressing problem  The EPA should reverse course and commit to a comprehensive testing and cleanup program that can identify and eliminate any remaining contamination  and can assure New Yorkers that their schools  offices and homes are safe     the Senator s letter concluded          Shortly after September 11  Senator Clinton and her colleague Congressman Jerrold Nadler pushed the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to begin an indoor cleanup program in New York   In August of 2003  the EPA Inspector General  IG  issued a report identifying major flaws in the EPA indoor cleanup program  including its failure to include areas north of Canal Street or in Brooklyn   Senator Clinton and Congressman Nadler pressed the Administration to respond to the IG  s report  resulting in the formation of the EPA World Trade Center Expert Technical Review Panel  WTC Panel    The WTC panel considered input from its own experts  as well as community and labor representatives  and advised EPA about how a new cleanup program should be designed  On November 29th last year  the EPA   ignoring input from its own panel members  residents  workers and the community   announced their plan to retest and clean indoor air spaces following the collapse of the World Trade Center  Fundamentally  the plan failed to correct the major problems identified by EPA s Inspector General in 2003          In December last year  Senator Clinton and Congressman Nadler responded by calling for the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to undertake an investigation into the EPA s failure to establish an effective  science based testing and clean up plan for testing and cleaning indoor air contamination following the September 11th attacks  In addition to the GAO report  Clinton and Nadler also called on the EPA to put forward a revised plan that would include residential  commercial  and work places in expanded geographic areas that were not included in the EPA s final plan            The illnesses of former Stuyvesant High School students raise new questions about the toxic legacy of September 11   The federal government must take care of those residents  workers  students and first responders who are ill   It is long past time for EPA to implement a comprehensive testing and clean up program to assure New Yorkers that their schools  offices and homes are safe     Senator Clinton said  following the release of the letter          Senator Clinton has fought hard over the past five years to secure funding and support for those brave men and women who selflessly responded in the days  weeks and months after 9 11 and for the residents and office workers who were affected   She lead efforts to secure  12 million in December of 2001 to establish the World Trade Center Worker and Volunteer Medical Screening Program at Mt  Sinai  the first program designed to track and monitor the health of 9 11 responders   When it was clear this money was not nearly enough to meet the need  she worked with her colleagues to get an additional  90 million to expand the number of workers and volunteers eligible   When the Administration then took back an additional  125 million in aid  she fought successfully to restore it and redirect funds for treatment   marking the first time any federal aid has been allocated for treatment services for our heroes          Senator Clinton has authored the 9 11 Heroes Health Improvement Act of 2006  which would authorize  1 9 billion in medical and mental health monitoring and treatment grants to firefighters  first responders  police officers  workers  volunteers  residents  and others whose health was directly impacted at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills that will be available from 2007 2011   She also is the lead sponsor in the Senate of bills introduced by both Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and Congressman Jerrold Nadler to address these issues          Senator Clinton also joined with Senator George V  Voinovich  R OH  to sponsor a successful amendment to the Security and Accountability for Every Port Act which will facilitate health monitoring of individuals exposed to harmful substances as a result of future terrorist attacks or natural disasters          As part of her efforts  Senator Clinton also recently joined with Senators Robert Menendez  D NJ   Frank R  Lautenberg  D NJ  and Charles Schumer  D NY  to introduce The James Zadroga Act of 2006 to amend the eligibility rules of the 9 11 Victims Compensation Fund  extending the filing deadline beyond the original December 2003 limit so that victims and first responders who became ill    in addition to their respective family members    can still be compensated  The bill will also allow for adjustment of previous awards and allow eligibility to responders and families of responders who arrived to Ground Zero after the first 96 hours
