August 31  2005 Statement of Senator Clinton Regarding Hurricane Katrina                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Like so many New Yorkers  I have followed with grave concern the tragedy that has devastated the states of Louisiana  Mississippi and Alabama  My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of the victims of Hurricane Katrina  who are faced with not only devastating personal losses  but also with the widespread destruction of their communities  I have spoken to Senator Landrieu  and she has painted a tragic portrait of suffering in New Orleans and in the Parishes of St  Bernard  St  Tammany  Jefferson  and Plaquemines  I know many other areas in the region are facing similar scenes of destruction  New Yorkers will never forget the generosity that descended upon New York City four years ago in our time of need  nor the enormous difference it made in our efforts to cope and to rebuild in the face of great tragedy   Today  we send our thoughts and prayers to those affected by this disaster  and I ask all New Yorkers to contribute what they can to the Red Cross and other organizations who are helping with relief efforts
