September 12  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on Feds to Provide Funding to Control the Spread of the Deadly Fish Disease  VHS  in Great Lakes Region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined several of her colleagues in urging the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry to provide assistance in the upcoming 2007 Farm Bill to states whose aquaculture and fishing industries have been blighted by the deadly fish disease  Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia  VHS   In a letter to Committee Chairman Tom Harkin and Ranking Member Saxby Chambliss  the lawmakers stressed the need for language to be included in the Farm Bill that would ensure assistance is provided to Great Lakes states for testing  monitoring  and enforcement of VHS guidelines    The effort made by the USDA and APHIS in combating the spread of VHS and other animals and diseases that threaten the Great Lakes and many smaller New York water bodies is encouraging  but I am still very concerned about the negative impact that the virus continues to have on the environment and on businesses in our state  said Senator Clinton  The APHIS order simply did not provide the necessary resources to get the job done  and it is unfair to think that states like New York should shoulder the entire burden of testing  monitoring  and enforcement  Our fisheries and marine industries are vital to New Yorks economic wellbeing  and that requires maintaining a healthy ecosystem in the Great Lakes  Adding language to the Farm Bill that authorizes assistance to states like New York that border the Great Lakes is critical in controlling the VHS problem     In October 2006  the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  issued an order to prevent the spread of VHS  which stopped the interstate movement within the Great Lakes states of more than 3 dozen species of live fish that are susceptible to the disease  However  these states do not have adequate capacity to perform the necessary quantity of testing in an expeditious and efficient manner  and the APHIS order did not provide any assistance to states to help with required testing  monitoring  and enforcement  As such all of these responsibilities have been placed on the Great Lakes states and tribal management authorities  The authorization of additional federal funds will provide the necessary assistance to states and monitoring agencies that are working to isolate  and curb the spread of the disease in the Great Lakes region    A copy of the letter to Senators Harkin and Chambliss is attached    September 11  2007   The Honorable Tom Harkin  Chairman  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  328A Russell Senate Office Bldg   Washington  DC  20510 The Honorable Saxby Chambliss  Ranking Member  Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  328A Russell Senate Office Bldg   Washington  DC  20510    Dear Mr  Chairman and Ranking Member    In October 2006  the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  issued an order to prevent the spread of a very deadly fish disease called viral hemorrhagic septicemia  VHS    This disease and efforts to contain it have had serious impacts on our aquaculture and fishing industries  and we are writing to ask that you include authority in the upcoming 2007 Farm Bill to provide assistance to states for monitoring  testing  and enforcement    The 2006 order stopped the interstate movement within the Great Lakes states of more than 3 dozen species of live fish that are susceptible to VHS   If fish are certified to be VHS free  they may be shipped across state lines   Unfortunately  the Great Lakes states do not have sufficient testing facility capacity to test the volume of samples in a timely way   When APHIS issued the order  it did not provide any assistance to states to help with testing  monitoring and enforcement   Further  the Office of Management and Budget recently denied a request by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to use Commodity Credit Corporation  CCC  emergency money for cooperative agreements between the USDA and state agencies to conduct surveillance in order to determine the geographic and species distribution of the disease and to establish an education campaign focused on recreational activities which might spread the disease and on compliance of the current order   Therefore  all of these responsibilities would be placed on the Great Lakes states and tribal management authorities    We want to ensure that VHS is contained and perhaps even cured  and we hope that this can be done without severe economic impacts to the aquaculture industry  states  or tribal management authorities   We believe that the needed authority which will provide assistance to states for monitoring  testing  curing and enforcement  and we urge you to include this language in your legislation      Sincerely    Debbie Stabenow
