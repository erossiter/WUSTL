                                                                                                                                                                                                                      On eve of one of the largest interest rate hikes on outstanding student loans  report provides state by state analysis of rising college costs and student debt      Report reveals the cost of attending a four year public college in New York has increased 21  and the cost of attending a four year private school has increased 23                                                                     Washington  DC   On the eve of one of the largest interest rate hikes on outstanding student loans  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined today Senate Democrats to urge students to consolidate their loans if possible and unveiled a report on the state of student debt and the increasing cost of attending college in the United States  The Democrats also announced that they are introducing legislation to address the crisis of student loan debt          According to the report released today  the cost of attending a four year public college in New York increased 21  and the cost of attending a four year private school increased 23  between the 2000 2001 school years and the 2004 2005 school years          The report  entitled   The College Cost Crunch     provides a state by state analysis of the rising cost of college  the erosion of the value of the Pell grant  the average student loan debt incurred by college graduates  and the percent of family income needed to pay for college after financial aid             At a time when incomes are stagnating  when people are losing benefits like health care and pensions  when gas prices are rising  and when the minimum wage hasn t increased in almost a decade  New York families can ill afford to pay higher rates for college loans   Instead of increasing the burden on families  we should be doing everything we can to make college more affordable so we can open the doors of higher education to more students     Senator Clinton said          The report also lays out how each state would benefit from the implementation of Democratic proposals by showing the amount of savings generated if loan interest rates were cut in half  the increase in the average Pell Grant award and the increase in the number of Pell recipients if the Pell Grant were increased to  5 100  the reduction in monthly loan payments for starting teachers if repayment was capped at 15  of income  and the number of students and families who would benefit by the re institution of the college tuition tax deduction            Students are taking on more student loan debt than ever   According to the most recent statistics  two thirds of all four year college graduates had loan debt     Senator Clinton said     In New York  59 percent of undergraduates took out loans to finance their college education   The average student graduating from a four year college in New York owed  17 594  And debt levels are impacting students   career and life choices  Unfortunately for students and graduates in New York and all over the country  this challenge is about to get even greater             Senate Democrats today spoke about the urgent need to focus on the findings of the report  and to implement proposals to address the debt crisis and to ensure that cost is not a barrier to getting a college degree  The Senators pointed to the near two percentage point student loan interest rate hike scheduled for Saturday as yet another reminder that the time to act is now  and reminded students that they have only a few days left in which to lock in today s lower rates through consolidation            Last December the Republican leadership in Congress decided to impose one of the largest hikes in student loan interest rates in history   When this week ends  on Saturday July 1st  the interest rate paid by college students and their parents will rise by 2 percent     Senator Clinton said    I encourage all student borrowers to look into consolidating their loans   if they do it this week  they may be able to lock in a lower interest rate than they would pay starting Saturday             The Senators also announced new legislation to address the crisis of student loan debt  the  Student Debt Relief Act           This bill would               Increase need based aid             Cut student loan interest rates in half    to 3 4 percent for students and 4 25 percent for PLUS Loans             Provide debt relief by capping federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrower  s monthly discretionary income and forgiving student loans after 25 years             Provide loan forgiveness for public sector employees after 10 years             Allow students to reconsolidate loans             Reduce origination fees by 1 percent  and             Extend college tuition tax credit deduction and increases allowable deduction to  12 000           Senator Clinton has also introduced legislation to create a Student Borrower Bill of Rights which would             Make it easier for students to repay their loans and give them rights that are enforceable             Give borrowers the right to fair  monthly payments that do not exceed a certain percentage of their incomes and fair interest rates and fees             Give borrowers the right to borrow without exploitation  and            Give students access to better information about loans and more information that will give them better options          A breakdown of student debt and the increasing cost of attending college in New York State is below  Click here to access the full report      THE COLLEGE COST CRUNCH    NEW YORK         The Cost of College Has Soared   Between the 2000 2001 and 2004 2005 school years  the cost of attendance at four year public colleges in New York increased 21   from  10 254 to  12 441 for tuition  fees  room and board   The cost of attendance at four year private colleges in New York increased 23  from  25 171 to  30 907 for tuition  fees  room and board           Median Family Incomes Have Remained Stagnant   While public college costs have increased 21   median family incomes in New York have increased only 10  since 2000   After financial aid is taken into account  32  of the average family income in New York is needed to pay for tuition at a four year public college           Federal Student Aid Has Eroded Over Time   In New York the maximum Pell grant  which has remained at  4 050 for the past four years  covered only 33  of the average public four year college tuition  fees  room and board in 2004 2005    down from 45  in 1986 1987   In 1975 1976  77  of federal aid going to students nationally was in the form of grants  and only 20  was loans   In 2004 2005  it was 70  loans  20  grants           Students Have Taken on More Debt to Pay for College   More students are leaving college in debt   In 2004  nearly two thirds of all four year college graduates nationwide had loan debt  compared with less than one third of graduates in 1993   In New York  59  of undergraduates took out loans to finance their college education   The average student graduating from a four year college in New York owed  17 594 on graduation day in 2004          Increased Debt Levels Are Impacting Students   Career and Life Choices   Nationally  nearly a quarter of public four year college graduates and over a third of private four year college graduates have too much debt to manage on a starting teacher  s salary   Debt levels are also causing students to delay buying a home or a car and postpone marriage or having children       To Reverse these Trends  Democrats Propose a New Direction to Help New York Students      Democrats opposed recent Republican efforts to raise student loan interest rates  and have called for a reduction in interest rates   If interest rates were cut in half  New York college graduates would save  3 518 over the ten year life of their loans             Democrats have also called for debt relief for college graduates with excessive loan burdens   If federal student loan payments were capped at 15  of a borrower  s discretionary income  starting teachers in New York earning  36 400  who graduate with the state average student loan debt of  17 594  would see a reduction of about  39  or 19   in their monthly loan payments   For individuals who continue in public service careers for 10 years  student loan debt would be forgiven           Democrats have called for increasing the maximum Pell Grant from  4 050 to  5 100   With an increase in the Pell Grant  19 865 more New York college students would be eligible for  321 769 972 in additional need based grant aid  The average grant in New York would increase by  677  from  2 543 to  3 220           Democrats have also called for an extension of the college tuition tax deduction  which expired at the end of 2005  and have proposed increasing the allowable deduction to  12 000   In the 2003 tax year  238 254 New York students and families benefited from the tuition tax deduction
