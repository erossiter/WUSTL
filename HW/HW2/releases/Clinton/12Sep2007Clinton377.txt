September 12  2007 Letter from Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to President Bush in Advance of His Speech to the Nation on Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Click here for a PDF    September 12  2007   The Honorable George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President    As you prepare to address the nation tomorrow  I write to request that you seize the opportunity and offer the American people a candid assessment of the challenges that we contin ue to face in Iraq and offer a change in course to your failing strategy    Over the past two days  General David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker have testified before Congress about the current situation in Iraq   General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker both have long and distinguished careers in service to our nation and in their testimony  they tried to put the best possible face on the difficult situation that we confront in Iraq    In their testimony  however  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker could not mask the fact that the ostensible goal for increasing U S  troops in Iraq earlier this year  to create the space for Iraqi political reconciliation  has not been met   And indeed  serious concerns have been raised about many of the metrics cited by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker in support of their assertion that progress is being made in Iraq     General Petraeus testified that he has proposed a decrease of five combat brigades in Iraq by July August 2008 and press reports have suggested that you plan to announce your acceptance of this recommendation when you address the nation tomorrow evening   However  if completed  these troop reductions would merely bring troop levels in Iraq back to the levels before you announced the surge in January of this year   Moreover  as was discussed during General Petraeus s testimony  troop levels in Iraq must decrease by this amount in order to avoid extending Army deployments beyond 15 months and straining our military even further    What you are planning to tell the American people tomorrow night is that one year from now  there will be the same number of troops in Iraq as there were one year ago   Mr  President  that is simply too little too late  and unacceptable to this Congress  and to the American people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home  and end this war     As Commander in Chief you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq  and to bring so many more troops home so much faster   I strongly urge you to choose this course of action    Mr  President  it has been nearly four and a half years since you landed on an aircraft carrier and stood before the American people under a banner that read Mission Accomplished  Do not repeat that mistake on Thursday night   Do not misrepresent the facts about the situation on the ground   And do not portray an unavoidable reduction in U S  troops to pre surge levels that would occur anyway as a marker of success   Be candid with the American people   They deserve it    Thank you for your consideration    Sincerely yours     Hillary Rodham Clinton   Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
