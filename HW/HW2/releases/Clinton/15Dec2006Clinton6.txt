December 15  2006 Statement of Senators Jack Reed and Hillary Rodham Clinton on Increasing the Endstrength of The Army and the Marines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Press reports indicate that the leaders of the uniformed services are recommending that the Bush Administration increase the endstrength of the Army and Marines   Given the strain that our military is currently operating under  it is imperative that we act quickly to meet this need    As members of the Senate Armed Services committee  we have long called for increasing the size of the Army and Marines and have sponsored legislation to increase the endstrength of the Army over the next several years  It is critically important that the Department of Defense include an increase in Army and Marine endstrength in the Pentagon budget  We look forward to continue working with incoming Armed Services Chairman Carl Levin and our Armed Services colleagues in the 110th Congress to make increasing Army and Marine endstrength a priority
