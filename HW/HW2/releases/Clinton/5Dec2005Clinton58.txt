                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Syracuse  NY    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined today with New Jobs for New York and Lockheed Martin to host    Make Your Professional Mark     a major collegiate job and internship fair          One of the key challenges facing New York is the need stop the outflow of young people from the state and to attract and retain young adults who will stay in the state and contribute to its economic future  The goal of   Make Your Professional Mark     was to match New York companies and their job opportunities with students from colleges across the state  The opportunities on offer at the conference were as diverse as the companies themselves and included everything from developing cutting edge technologies to helping emerging companies thrive in the changing global economy            The conference  which was hosted in partnership with the Metropolitan Development Association of Syracuse and Central New York and the Greater Syracuse Chamber of Commerce  brought together over 700 students from 66 colleges and universities across New York State  connecting them with over 75 companies from Upstate New York  with over 2 500 open jobs and over 450 open internships on offer           The conference featured a keynote address by Senator Clinton who also hosted a panel discussion featuring business and community leaders from Upstate New York  The panel    Opportunities for Young Adults in Upstate New York     included Jessica Crawford  Chairwoman of the Steering Committee  40 Below  Mac Cummings  President and CEO  Terakeet Corporation  David Koretz  President and CEO  BlueTie Corporation and Judy Marks  President  Transportation and Security Solutions  Lockheed Martin             As students preparing to graduate with degrees from finance and science to the arts  they have the potential and the opportunity to emerge as business and community leaders in this region and to make a lasting impact on this state     said Roger C  Altman  Chairman of the Board of Directors for New Jobs for New York     By bringing these students together with local companies face to face  we are making connections that have the power to revitalize the region  s economy and create jobs over the coming years               New York State has some of the leading companies and academic institutions and it has some of the best places to live in America  We need to make sure that students who are already studying here understand the real  tangible benefits of living here after they have graduated     Senator Clinton said    With over 700 students from 66 colleges and universities across New York State talking to over 75 companies offering over 2 500 open jobs and over 450 open internships  we are making the connections that we hope will keep our young people right here in New York  The jobs that these students consider today have the power to not only stop them from leaving New York but to entice them to stay for the long term  which is exactly what our state needs               Today  s job fair is a great opportunity for companies based in Central and Upstate New York to showcase their technology prowess to our future leaders  as well as for industry to meet a new pool of college students with great potential     said New Jobs for New York Vice Chair Judy Marks  who is president of Lockheed Martin Transportation and Security Solutions    Outreach programs such as this are investments in our company s future as well as every community in this region  We  re able to keep talented personnel with
