March 10  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the EPA Clean Air Interstate Rule                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC    Steeper cuts in pollution are necessary to fully address the health and environmental threats in New York caused by power plant pollution  but EPA s rule is a step in the right direction  The rule achieves the same nitrogen and sulfur reductions as the President s  Clear Skies  bill without gutting Clean Air Act tools that New York has relied on and as the bill would have done  I remain concerned  however  about the EPA s final rule to regulate mercury emissions from power plants  which we expect to see next week  The EPA s draft mercury proposal would create hot spots of this dangerous neurotoxin that we know is present in unhealthy levels in one in twelve American women  The EPA needs to require steeper reductions for all power plants before they finalize the mercury rule next week
