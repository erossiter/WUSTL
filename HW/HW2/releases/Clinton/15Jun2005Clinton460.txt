June 15  2005 Prepared Floor Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Bush Administration  s Repeated Attempts to Put Politics and Ideology Over Science                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    Mr  President  I rise to express my deep concern about the growing politicization of science by this Administration        Last week  it was revealed that a White House official with ties to the petroleum industry doctored government climate reports    These reports had already been approved by government scientists   However Philip Cooney  the chief of staff for President Bush  s environmental policy council and a former lobbyist who has no scientific training  changed the reports in order to downplay the links between greenhouse gas emissions and global warming           This revelation was alarming and dismaying  but it was hardly surprising   These days  Washington often feels like an   evidence free zone     where facts are only useful and necessary when they support your pre determined position         That reality is further driven home by the stories in today  s newspapers  which reveal that Mr  Cooney  who resigned his government post last week  has already been hired by ExxonMobil          So we are left with the distinct impression that the chief of staff of the President  s environmental policy council was not working on behalf of the American people  but was instead using his government post to benefit his once and future bosses in the petroleum industry  to whom he has now returned         This is not a unique story in this Administration   Way back in December 2003  the Advisory Committee to the Food and Drug Administration found that the   Plan B    contraception was safe and effective  and recommend by a vote of 23 4 that it be approved for over the counter sales  But for only the second time in five decades  the FDA has refused to abide by its advisory committee  s opinion   It has refused to approve Plan B for over the counter sales   In fact  it has refused to take any action at all           What we are witnessing is the FDA    an agency whose mission is to protect public health   being run not on the basis of science  but of ideology           Today the HELP Committee voted out the nomination of the FDA Acting Commissioner  Dr  Crawford  to become the permanent Commissioner   Because of the FDA  s failure to give American women  a   yes    or   no    answer on Plan B for almost two years  Senator Murray and I are putting a hold on his nomination   Dr  Crawford has been in charge as the FDA has drifted away from objectivity  and in the process has lost much of its credibility   Public confidence in the ability of the FDA to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs is failing  The dedicated scientists and civil servants who work at the agency are losing morale  They have clearly identified the need for reform  for change  and for improvements at the agency  but Dr  Crawford shows no sign that he is prepared to return the Agency to its scientific principles         The American people deserve better   They deserve a government that works to protect their quality of life  their environment and the future of their children by engaging with the world as it actually exists  not by crafting an alternative reality to further a political agenda or to do the bidding of a powerful lobby         My predecessor here in the Senate  Daniel Patrick Moynihan  was fond of saying that   everyone is entitled to his own opinion  but not his own facts       It is perfectly appropriate for politicians and parties to have different priorities and different policy preferences   That is the essence of democracy    the American people are empowered to choose from candidates with different ideas         But it is unacceptable  undemocratic  and dangerous for a government to promote its policies by distorting science and by misleading the American people on issues that directly impact our health and well being         Most Americans do not have the time to sift through the mountains of data generated on scientific questions   They rely on their government to analyze scientific data and to concisely present the findings in an honest  forthright manner   And they rightly expect their government to play it straight  In a national survey conducted last fall by the Integrity of Science Working Group  two thirds of those surveyed strongly believe that government science should be insulated from politics        But instead of a government that presents the facts and then makes an argument for its policies  the American people are being governed by an Administration that chooses its policies on the basis of ideology  and then misrepresents  or just ignores  facts that it finds inconvenient         Interference in and abuse of publicly funded science  suppressing or disregarding scientific evidence  manipulating scientific advice  and politicizing scientific advisory panels  are now all part of the standard tools of American politics         The examples are legion  even without this latest addition of the global warming reports to the list   For example  in February 2005  the Environmental Protection Agency  s own inspector general reported that agency scientists had been pressured to change their scientific findings on toxic mercury pollution in order to justify the Administration  s industry friendly rules   And a report by the non partisan Government Accountability Office found that the EPA had distorted its analysis of the health impacts of mercury on brain development in children and fetuses        The Executive Branch  s manipulation and distortion of science for political gain is enormously destructive to the integrity of our science and to the credibility of our government   And it is bad for our economy  because it retards technological innovation and scientific breakthroughs    Most importantly  it is a fundamental betrayal of our public trust   Those of us in government hold office on behalf of all of our constituents    there is no room for   industry men    or   industry women     who distort scientific facts in order support a particular lobby          We must alter course  and put our country back on the path of scientific integrity and fact based policymaking   Standing by a misguided policy in the face of compelling scientific evidence is not consistency    it is obstinacy   And shifting environmental policies when presented with new information is not   waffling       it is good  pragmatic governing          We must keep politics out of our science   We must stop the backwards  destructive pattern of denying the truth when it is unpleasant or undesirable    We must instead spend our time thinking    and yes  arguing    about how to best use the gift of our knowledge        Americans have overcome every challenge in our nation  s history by bravely facing facts  and then rolling up our sleeves and getting to work    And I have every confidence that we are up to the task of meeting all of the challenges facing us today   But we need a government that is driven by scientific evidence and facts  not politics and ideology
