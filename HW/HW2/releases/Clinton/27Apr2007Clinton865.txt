April 27  2007 NY Area Senators  Reps Demand 9 11 Health Plan Answers from Bush Administration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC   Today  members of the New York area Congressional delegation again pressed the Bush Administration to provide details on its plan to medically monitor and treat all those impacted by exposure to hazards related to the 9 11 attacks   Reps  Carolyn Maloney  D NY  and Vito Fossella  R NY   Sens  Charles Schumer  D NY  and Hillary Clinton  D NY   along with Reps  Edolphus Towns  D NY   Jerrold Nadler  D NY  and Christopher Shays  R CT  sent a  joint letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt after the Administration s top 9 11 health official  Dr  John Agwunobi  refused in both testimony and correspondence to provide further information on the Administration s plan           Those suffering from 9 11 health related problems deserve immediate answers and action   not more needless delays from the Administration   said Maloney    The New York area delegation will not rest until a comprehensive 9 11 health plan is realized           Fossella said   The unsung heroes of 9 11 need access to medical monitoring and treatment  The federal government needs to move forward without delay in releasing a comprehensive plan of action and also funding needs for next year            Six years of empty promises is unacceptable   our sick 9 11 workers needed treatment yesterday   Despite repeated congressional efforts to fund adequate testing and treatment  this Administration has been long on promises and short on delivering vital funds for the heroes of 9 11   Everyday that they continue to delay  more heroes are denied the first rate care that their sacrifice demands   said Schumer           I am very disturbed by the lack of action on the part of the Department of Health and Human Services on this critical issue  The absence of an appropriate federal plan for 9 11 healthcare funding and the Administration s refusal to communicate with Congress is a real cause for concern  We certainly hope that their apparent silence on how they intend to allocate future 9 11 funding is not an indicator that they plan to withdraw support for the important and necessary Centers of Excellence   Clinton said           The Administration is clearly hoping the challenges related to the health of 9 11 responders and community residents will simply go away without really dealing with them   HHS needs to come clean and make up for almost six years of very limited action to help the heroes and the victims of 9 11   Towns said             The Bush administration must come up with more than  25 million to monitor and treat all those who were exposed to environmental toxins following the events of 9 11   said Nadler    In addition  in order to ensure that the Federal government properly pays its debt  ultimately the Administration must work with Congress to devise a long term  comprehensive solution that will allow for ongoing medical monitoring and treatment that is not subject to these annual budget battles   These 9 11 heroes need help  and thus far the Bush administration has yet to support a comprehensive strategy to help them           Added Shays   Firefighters  police  emergency medical personnel  transit workers  construction crews and other first responders as well as volunteers came to Ground Zero knowing there would be risks  but confident their community would sustain them    It is clearly evident from the hearings my subcommittee held on this subject that diverse and delayed health problems continue to emerge in those exposed to the contaminants and psychological stressors unleashed on September 11  2001   These people require help  they require answers  and they require a plan           The Administration had previously indicated that it would finalize its plan by February 2007  but to date no such plan has been shared with Congress or the public   In January  the Administration notified Congress that it would include  25 million for 9 11 health treatment in the president s FY08 budget  and that this funding would serve as a  placeholder  until the release of its comprehensive funding plan for FY08 the following month   With the appropriations process for FY08 well under way in Congress  the delegation members expressed their concern that the Administration s delays could force federally funded health clinics such as those operated by Mt  Sinai Hospital and the FDNY to shut their doors       Background   04 05 07  Response Letter from Dr  John Agwunobi to NY area Delegation   03 06 07   Administration s Top 9 11 Health Official s Testimony Draws Concern from NY
