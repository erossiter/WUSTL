July 13  2005 Senate Approves Clinton Amendment to Assess Potential Terrorist Threat Posed by General Aviation Aircraft                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Amendment to Homeland Security Bill requires nationwide assessment of threats and vulnerabilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the U S  Senate approved an Amendment to the FY 2006 Homeland Security Appropriations bill that she sponsored  requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a nationwide assessment of the potential threat that cities  states  and key infrastructure face from the theft or misuse of general aviation aircraft by criminals or terrorists   Senators Durbin  IL   Lautenberg  NJ   Corzine  NJ   Schumer  NY   and Lieberman  CT  co sponsored the Amendment          The Senator  s legislation  which was offered as an Amendment to the Senate  s Homeland Security Bill  would require the government to undertake an assessment of the dangers posed to high risk  large populations and critical infrastructure areas  should general aviation aircraft be stolen and used as a weapon  The study would also require an assessment of the vulnerabilities of general aviation airports and aircraft and what low cost  high technology devices could be available to better track general aviation aircraft            I believe that this kind of national assessment is absolutely necessary to avoid a repeat of the type of attack carried out on September 11  2001 or some sinister copycat of it     Senator Clinton said    We must not turn away from the challenge of assessing threats posed by thefts or hijackings of general aviation aircraft             Last month  an intoxicated individual stole a small Cessna 172 aircraft from an airport in Danbury  CT  eventually landing at the Westchester County Airport  located just to the east of the Indian Point nuclear facility            Thankfully  the Danbury incident ended without any damage  destruction or death  But it stands as a forewarning of the types of threats to which we remain vulnerable     Senator Clinton said    Our nuclear plants  key infrastructure  military bases  not to mention our large cities  could be threatened and all of the advances we have made in the area of homeland security could be subverted if general aviation airports can be breached this easily and the airplanes used as weapons             It is estimated that there are more than 19 000 landing facilities nationwide  including heliports  lakes  and dirt landing strips from which aircraft could be launched and more than 200 000 general aviation aircraft in the United States          In its report  the 9 11 Commission concluded that     M ajor vulnerabilities still exist in cargo and general aviation security   These  together with inadequate screening and access controls  continue to present aviation security challenges     The report also said that part of the failure of the U S  government  s ability to thwart the September 11th terrorist attacks using airplanes was  in part  due to a lack of imagination about new and emerging threats in the bureaucracy          In May 2004 the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  issued their   Security Guidelines for General Aviation Airports     in which they outlined some guidelines general aviation airports should follow in order to secure aircraft and airfields  However  the same report also stated that    A s vulnerabilities within other areas of aviation have been reduced  General Aviation may be perceived as a more attractive target and consequently more vulnerable to misuse by terrorists             Specifically  Senator Clinton  s Amendment would require the Secretary of Homeland Security  in coordination with the Secretary of Transportation  to conduct a threat assessment posed by security breaches at general aviation airports and what threats our high population areas  nuclear facilities  key infrastructure  military bases and transportation infrastructure face from stolen or hijacked general aviation aircraft if used as a weapon or loaded with explosives by terrorists  It requires the Department of Homeland Security to asses low cost technologies to track general aviation aircraft  the feasibility of implementing additional security measures and background checks  an analysis of airports with unmanned air traffic control towers  and what costs may be associated with implementing additional security measures  The amendment does not mandate new costs for general aviation rather it requires the TSA to study the vulnerabilities and report to Congress its findings within 120 days            I respect and admire the work being done by the general aviation fixed base operators  pilots  owners  airport managers  and others who have worked hard to increase security measures at general aviation airports     Senator Clinton said    General aviation is a significant contributor to the national economy and I believe our aviators should enjoy the freedom of flight throughout the country while at the same time our Department of Homeland Security can ensure safety on the ground
