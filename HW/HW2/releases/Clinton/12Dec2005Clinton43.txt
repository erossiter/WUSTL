December 12  2005 Statement of Senator Clinton on Release of the Final the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I commend the effort that New Yorkers and people from throughout the Great Lakes region put into the development of this strategy   It charts a path to cleaning up and restoring the Great Lakes   Unfortunately  a plan without a commitment of new resources from the President is simply an empty promise   I am disappointed that there was no commitment from the Administration to provide the necessary resources in next year s budget   If the President continues to fail to meet this promise  I stand ready to fight for needed funding in Congress             On November 4  Senator Clinton joined a bipartisan group of members of Congress from the Great Lakes region in writing the President regarding the need for greater resources for Great Lakes restoration  The letter was a reaction to a release by the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force  which indicated that funding to implement the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy would need to stay within current budget projections  contradicting earlier Administration indications that they would consider new budget initiatives for implementation  In the letter  Senator Clinton and her colleagues voiced their concern over this revised position           A copy of the letter is attached        The Northeast Midwest Coalition  GREAT LAKES TASKFORCE         November 4  2005         President George W  Bush  The White House  Washington  DC 20502         Dear Mr  President           We are writing to follow up on the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force  s Report to the President on the Implementation of the Great Lakes Executive Order  After reading the report  we are disappointed by the limitations placed on Regional Collaboration through this report           When Regional Collaboration was initiated last year  nothing indicated that the Regional Collaboration Strategy needed to stay within current budget projections  and we were led to believe that the Administration would consider some new budget initiatives  A serious consideration of the challenges faced in the Great Lakes region requires a commitment of federal resources           As you stated in the Executive Order    the Great Lakes are a national treasure     and we were encouraged by the Administration  s commitment to address the environmental and natural resource challenges of the Lakes through a   regional collaboration of national significance     The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration has brought together roughly 1 500 people who are dedicated to protecting and restoring the Great Lakes  All of these individuals contributed time and resources in order to develop a strategic  comprehensive strategy for the Great Lakes           Meaningful  Great Lakes restoration cannot happen without support from all levels of government  including the federal government  The states  municipalities  and tribal officials  as well as the individual participants  have provided tremendous support for Regional Collaboration  However  these efforts alone will not restore the Lakes  Each party must be willing to provide additional short and long term commitments in the near future  The problems impacting the Great Lakes will only get worse over time  and the implementation of the solutions will only become more expensive           We cannot wait to start restoring the Great Lakes to a healthy condition for future generations  The Great Lakes are vital to our cities    states   and nation  s environment  economy and way of life  We appreciate your past support for improving the Great Lakes and strongly urge that you maintain your commitment to the Great Lakes by not limiting restoration recommendations to the current budget projections          Sincerely
