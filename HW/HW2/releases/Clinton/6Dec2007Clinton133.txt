                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Also Joins Other Senators in Letter Warning the President Against Long Term Security Commitments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today continued to express grave concern about the implications of President Bushs recently signed Declaration of Principles for a Long term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship with Iraq  Senator Clinton introduced legislation today that requires the President to seek Congressional approval for any agreement that would extend the U S  military commitment to Iraq  She also joined a number of other Senators in a letter warning the President against rushing the United States into long term security commitments to the Iraqi government and urging him to seek Congressional consent  Senators Bob Casey  D PA   Robert Byrd  D WV   Ted Kennedy  D MA   Carl Levin  D MI   and Jim Webb  D VA  also signed the letter to President Bush    The Bush Administration must not circumvent Congress on the critical issue of the future U S  presence in Iraq  The Administration must not be permitted to enter into agreements that could lead to permanent bases in Iraq which would damage U S  interests in Iraq and the broader region without Congressional approval  said Senator Clinton    Last week  the Bush administration announced the Declaration of Principles for a Long term Relationship of Cooperation and Friendship with Iraq  an agreement to start formal negotiations with Iraq about a long term security pact between the United States and Iraq   The Declaration sets a goal of concluding this final agreement by July 31  2008    On November 27  Senator Clinton wrote President Bush to advise him that this agreement must not commit the United States to permanent bases in Iraq  and must include a commitment to the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq  Today she followed up with a second letter and the legislation that would require the President to seek Congressional approval for security agreements with Iraq    The legislation requires      No funds may be authorized or appropriated to carry out any bilateral agreement between the United States and Iraq involving commitments or risks affecting the nation as a whole  including a status of forces agreement  SOFA   that is not a treaty approved by two thirds of the Senate under Article II of the Constitution or authorized by legislation passed by both Houses of Congress     The State Department Legal Advisor must provide to the Congress a memorandum evaluating the Presidents decision to deny Congress its constitutionally protected role by concluding an agreement on the future of the U S  Iraqi security relationship as an executive agreement without the assent of the Congress     The memorandum must include an analysis of the Constitutional powers relied on by the President in reaching the conclusion that such an agreement does not require approval by the Congress     It is the sense of Congress that any bilateral agreement between the United States and Iraq involving commitments or risks affecting the nation as a whole  including a status of forces agreement  SOFA   that is not a treaty approved by two thirds of the Senate under Article II of the Constitution or authorized by legislation  does not have the force of law     The full text of the letter to President Bush follows      Dear Mr  President    We write you today regarding the Declaration of Principles agreed upon last week between the United States and Iraq outlining the broad scope of discussions to be held over the next six months to institutionalize long term U S  Iraqi cooperation in the political  economic  and security realms   It is our understanding that these discussions seek to produce a strategic framework agreement  no later than July 31  2008  to help define a long term relationship of cooperation and friendship as two fully sovereign and independent states with common interests      The future of American policy towards Iraq  especially in regard to the issues of U S  troop levels  permanent U S  military bases  and future security commitments  has generated strong debate among the American people and their elected representatives   Agreements between our two countries relating to these issues must involve the full participation and consent of the Congress as a co equal branch of the U S  government   Furthermore  the future U S  presence in Iraq is a central issue in the current Presidential campaign   We believe a security commitment that obligates the United States to go to war on behalf of the Government of Iraq at this time is not in Americas long term national security interest and does not reflect the will of the American people   Commitments made during the final year of your Presidency should not unduly or artificially constrain your successor when it comes to Iraq    In particular  we want to convey our strong concern regarding any commitments made by the United States with respect to American security assurances to Iraq to help deter and defend against foreign aggression or other violations of Iraqs territorial integrity   Security assurances  once made  cannot be easily rolled back without incurring a great cost to Americas strategic credibility and imperiling the stability of our nations other alliances around the world   Accordingly  security assurances must be extended with great care and only in the context of broad bipartisan agreement that such assurances serve our abiding national interest   Such assurances  if legally binding  are generally made in the context of a formal treaty subject to the advice and consent of the U S  Senate but in any case cannot be made without Congressional authorization    Our unease is heightened by remarks made on November 26th by General Douglas Lute  the Assistant to the President for Iraq and Afghanistan  that Congressional input is not foreseen   General Lute was quoted as asserting at a White House press briefing  We don t anticipate now that these negotiations will lead to the status of a formal treaty which would then bring us to formal negotiations or formal inputs from the Congress   It is unacceptable for your Administration to unilaterally fashion a long term relationship with Iraq without the full and comprehensive participation of Congress from the very start of such negotiations      We look forward to learning more details as the Administration commences negotiations with the Iraqi government on the contours of long term political  economic  and security ties between our two nations   We trust you agree that the proposed extension of long term U S  security commitments to a nation in a critical region of the world requires the full participation and consent of the Congress as a co equal branch of our government    Sincerely      Robert P  Casey  Jr   U S  Senator  Robert
