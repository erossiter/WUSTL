American Museum of Natural History  s Institute for Comparative Genomics and  6 million for New School University  s Parsons Institute for Information Mapping  PIIM    The House has approved the bill   The Senate is expected to work on the Defense Appropriations bill this week   If the bill is passed  it will be sent to the President for his signature         New York City has always been on the cutting edge of innovation  and New York companies have a strong tradition of contributing to our national defense   said Schumer    As the men and women of our military bravely serve our country all over the world  the funding for these New York City defense projects will vastly improve national security technology and will give our armed forces an even greater edge              New York City has already proven to the world its leadership in cutting edge research and technology   Senator Clinton said   This new funding will help protect our troops  both at home and abroad  and is an important investment in our local academic institutions            1 million in federal funds will go to the Columbia University Medical Center Mailman School of Public Health Northeast Biodefense Center Completion Project   In 2003  the Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University and the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center led a consortium of twenty eight institutions in New York  New Jersey and Connecticut in establishing the Northeast Biodefense Center  NBC   one of eight NIH regional centers of excellence in biodefense and emerging infectious diseases  The Columbia facility is the New York City base of the NBC  It also supports biodefense activities for the Departments of Health of New York City and New York State  as well as the World Health Organization Laboratory Network by providing surge capacity and access to unique diagnostic and pathogen surveillance technologies  Funds will be used to purchase equipment and to expand laboratory facilities for these new civil support functions as well as completing a new BSL 3 animal facility for research into vaccines and therapeutics for biodefense and emerging infectious diseases            1 million in federal funds will go to the New York Structural Biology Center  NYSBC    The NYSBC is a leading center in magnetic resonance spectroscopy  equipped with the most advanced grouping of spectrometers in the nation   Through collaborative efforts  NYSBC researchers and their counterparts at the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center  ECBC  are able to take advantage of the superior instrumentation and expertise at NYSBC to validate protocols that monitor the fate of chemical and biological warfare agents in battlefield and civilian environments such as concrete  asphalt  soil and water            1 million in federal funds will go to New York University  s Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and Response   New York University  s Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and Response supports 10 research projects that help meet the needs of the Department of Homeland Security  local preparedness efforts  and first responders  Representative CCPR projects include  Large Scale Emergency Readiness project to improve the nation  s preparedness for a large scale attack on an area such as New York City  Program on Law and Security to examine the legal dimensions of counter terrorism and security at the national and international levels  and the International Center for Enterprise Preparedness to strengthen the private sector preparedness through the world  s first major academic center dedicated to private sector crisis management and business continuity   Over the next year  CCPR intends to expand its efforts in these and other areas             1 million in federal funds will go to New York University  s Consortium on Preparedness   The Consortium on Preparedness will involve a number of facilities including the NYU School of Medicine  the NYU Hospitals Center  the

be to plan for large surges in patient populations  education and train medical and health personnel for possible events  provide psycho social support  and conduct research in the areas of bioterrorism and preparedness   Funding will be needed for support staff  equipment  information and telecommunication investments  as well as emergency preparedness and security needs             1 5 million in federal funds will go to the American Museum of Natural History  s Institute for Comparative Genomics research to advance national security goals   The American Museum of Natural History  one of the nation  s foremost research and public education institutions  is home to the Institute of Comparative Genomics  with preeminent programs in molecular biology  computation  and comparative genomics that are particularly equipped to advance Department of Defense  DOD  research priorities to benefit homeland biodefense and the nation  s security   In partnership with DOD  the Museum seeks to contribute to the Institute  s singular capacities to advancing genomic science and the understanding and response to threats of bioterrorism   It will leverage its participatory share with funds from nonfederal as well as federal sources and will use requested funding to advance into the next phase of its study of the evolution of pathogenicity  which is critical to constructing a general model for studying emergent infectious diseases            6 million in federal funds will go to New School University  s Parsons Institute for Information Mapping  PIIM    PIIM is a research institute dedicated to supporting analysts and decision makers through state of the art visualizations and the practical application of information and visualization theories   The FY 2006 funding would complete  jointly implement and deploy the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency  s  NGA  Geospace and Media Tool and Modular Integrated Knowledge System supporting Emergency Operation Centers  among other uses
