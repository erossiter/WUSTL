                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Collapse of Minnesota Bridge Highlights Need for Independent Review of Nation s Aging Transportation System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC  In the wake of the tragic bridge collapse in Minnesota  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called for the National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission to redouble their efforts in compiling a comprehensive analysis of our nations transportation infrastructure     The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission  a bi partisan body which was created in 2005  is tasked with providing a comprehensive  independent analysis on the future transportation needs of our nation  The Commission is scheduled to release its report in December  In a letter to Federal Transportation Secretary Mary Peters  who is the Chair of the Commission  Senator Clinton called on the Commissioners to redouble their efforts to ensure they submit a thorough  independent assessment to Congress so that the needs of Americas aging highway and transit system can be thoroughly addressed  Senator Clinton authored the amendment that created the Commission under the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  Efficient Transportation Equity ActA Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU     If it wasnt already crystal clear  the tragic events in Minnesota have served as a sober reminder of the shocking state of disrepair our nations transportation infrastructure has fallen into  said Senator Clinton  That is why it is critically important that the Commission put their full attention towards providing a comprehensive assessment  one that is above politics and partisanship  to address the needs of our aging highway and transit system    Reviews by both the American Society of Civil Engineers  ASCE  and Federal Highway Administration  FHA  have provided a stark view of Americas transportation infrastructure system  The ASCE stated in 2005 that it would take upwards of  1 6 trillion to overhaul the aging system  and the FHA reported that 12  of the nations bridges are structurally deficient while another 13  are functionally obsolete    Earlier this month  Senator Clinton welcomed Senate passage of the National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2007  bipartisan legislation she introduced with Senators Carper  Voinovich and Coleman  to address the deteriorating condition of our nation s roads  bridges  drinking water systems  dams and other public works  The bill will establish a National Commission on Infrastructure of the United States  charged with aiding in the nation s economic growth and ensuring the nation s infrastructure meets current and future demands    A copy of Senator Clintons letter to Secretary Peters follows    August 13  2007   The Honorable Mary E  Peters  Secretary  United States Department of Transportation  400 Seventh Street  S W   Washington  D C  20590   Dear Madam Secretary    In 2005  the American Society of Civil Engineers  ASCE  confirmed the poor state of our nations infrastructure  concluding that it would take an investment of  1 6 trillion to get everything from bridges to dams to rail networks to roads to public schools up to satisfactory standards   The recent bridge collapse in Minnesota underscores this point   According to the Federal Highway Administration  FHA   12  of the nations bridges are structurally deficient and another 13  are functionally obsolete   Our nations existing transportation infrastructure is in disrepair and it is inadequate for todays demands      As you know  Congress created The National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission in the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  Efficient Transportation Equity Act  A Legacy for Users  SAFETEA LU  in 2005 to tackle many of the current problems that we face today when it comes to transportation infrastructure   This bi partisan Commission was created to provide a comprehensive  independent analysis on the future transportation needs of our nation and the future of the Highway Trust Fund   It is imperative that we have a plan moving forward that identifies the needs of our highway and transit systems  as well as the needs of the highway trust fund so that the next time we reauthorize a highway bill  Congress will have a fresh look at what our nations transportation needs       As the Chair of this Commission and in light of the bridge collapse in Minnesota  I ask that you and your fellow Commissioners redouble your efforts to provide a thorough comprehensive  independent analysis that is above politics and that provides a roadmap for Congress to address our nations transportation infrastructure   Next year Congress will be moving to the reauthorization of the SAFETEA LU and the analysis conducted by the Commission will be critical    I thank you for your immediate consideration of this important matter   I look forward to working with you in addressing our nations transportation needs    Sincerely yours    Hillary Rodham Clinton   CC  Commissioner Frank Busalacchi  Commissioner Maria Cino  Commissioner Rick Geddes  Commissioner Steve Heminger
