June 25  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Secretary Chertoff s Meeting in Buffalo Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I am very pleased that the Secretary has taken the time to meet with community leaders from Western New York and I hope his visit has given him a real understanding of our needs in the region  I am sure that the people he met with today made it very clear to him that the Department of Homeland Security can no longer ignore the concerns of communities along the Northern Border  It is important that we explore all options when it comes to securing our border and developing a plan that addresses the economic realities of the region without compromising our security  I also hope that after nearly three years of keeping everyone in limbo over Shared Border Management  the Secretary now understands that he can no longer ignore our Northern Border communities or their very real concerns
