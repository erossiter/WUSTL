May 3  2007 Byrd  Clinton Call for End of 2002 Use of Force Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   U S  Senators Robert C  Byrd  D W Va   and Hillary Clinton  D N Y   are calling on Senators to end the 2002 use of force resolution against Iraq                  The Senators     both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee     believe that the 2002 resolution is outdated and that President Bush should make the case to the country to support any extended military action in Iraq                   The 2002 authorization to use force has run its course   It is time  past time  to decommission this authorization and retire it to the archives   If the President has more that he wants to do in Iraq  then he needs to make that case to Congress and to the American public   Byrd said in Senate debate today    The President must redefine the goals and submit his plan to achieve them to a thorough and open debate in the Congress and throughout the country   That is the American way   Success will elude us without the support of the people whose sons and daughters are being asked to die in the sands of Iraq                    The American people have called for change  the facts on the ground demand change  the Congress has passed legislation to require change   It is time to sunset the authorization for the war in Iraq   If the president will not bring himself to accept reality  it is time for Congress to bring reality to him   said Senator Clinton on the Senate floor                  The Byrd Clinton legislation would sunset the outdated 2002 use of force resolution at its five year anniversary  on October 11  2007   Byrd and Clinton would give President Bush the opportunity to return to Congress to make the case for the  new mission  in Iraq  a mission that Congress and the American people would then have to approve                  Ending the 2002 use of force resolution in October gives the Bush Administration the time it says it needs for its new security efforts  while giving the country and the Congress the ability to evaluate its success and decide on a future course                   A fresh start could change the dynamic in this country   We need a new mission which makes clear the changed role of our troops   We need a diplomatic component to the plan which might encourage the national reconciliation so badly needed to quell the violence in Iraq   We need a plan to reach out to other countries in the area who share our interest in seeking stability in Iraq   But first we need to clear the cobwebs and the confusion caused by a grant of authority that no longer has any relevance to the present condition of Iraq   Byrd stated               Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
