November 9  2007 Senator Clinton Urges Property Tax Relief for Middle Class Homeowners                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Property Taxes Have Skyrocketed While Median Household Income Has Decreased                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton joined several of her colleagues in urging Senate leadership to consider a measure that would provide a new standard deduction on property taxes for the nations middle class homeowners who are struggling to keep pace with escalating property tax rates  In a letter  the lawmakers citied the tax package passed by the House Ways and Means Committee which includes property tax relief for millions of middle class Americans  and urged the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee to include a similar homeowner tax relief deduction in the Committees tax extender package that is now under consideration    New Yorks taxpayers are working harder than ever to make ends meet  While property tax rates have skyrocketed over the last six years  the median household income has actually decreased  adding to a financial burden that has threatened homeownership in communities throughout the State and country  said Senator Clinton  Enacting property tax relief this year will help balance the field for those taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions  and will provide critical financial assistance to the hardworking middle class    U S  taxpayers are working harder than ever to meet their financial obligations  and rising property tax rates have only increased the burden  Census data shows that from 2000 to 2006   the total amount of state and local property taxes increased by 50 percent  while inflation increased by only 17 percent  Over that same period of time  median household income dropped by 2 percent     Taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions may claim the standard federal tax deduction  but this deduction does not adequately take into account the rising property tax values and increases  In 2005 roughly 1 4 million New York tax filers who paid property taxes did not itemize their deductions to account for property taxes  A new standard deduction for property taxes would treat itemizers and non itemizers more equitably  and would provide relief to the more than 32 million homeowners nationwide who do not itemize their deductions     The full text of the letter follows     November 7th  2007   The Honorable Max Baucus     The Honorable Charles Grassley   Chairman       Ranking Member  Senate Committee on Finance    Senate Committee on Finance  219 Dirksen Senate Office Building    219 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  DC 20510    Washington  DC 20510   Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley     As you are aware  last week the House Ways and Means Committee passed a tax package that included property tax relief for millions of middle class homeowners   The legislation  HR  3996  would create a new  standard deduction for real property taxes for homeowners who do not currently itemize their deductions   We support this proposal and feel strongly that Congress should enact property tax relief this year     Middle class taxpayers are working harder than ever to meet their financial commitments and sky rocketing property taxes have not made that any easier   While taxpayers who do not itemize their deductions may claim the standard federal tax deduction  this deduction does not adequately take into account rising property tax values and increases   Based on Census data  the total amount of state and local property taxes paid in the United States increased by 50 percent from 2000 to 2006   Over the same period of time  inflation increased by only 17 percent   Over that time  median household income actually dropped by 2 percent    A new  standard deduction for property taxes would provide relief to the more than 32 million homeowners who do not itemize their deductions   With homeownership threatened in many communities around the country  middle class families should not be penalized simply because they do not itemize   By treating itemizers and non itemizers more equitably  we will restore a measure of fairness to the tax code and provide needed relief to the middle class      While we recognize that property taxes are primarily a state and local issue  this does not mean that Congress should not do what it can help ease the burden for taxpayers   We are encouraged that Chairman Baucus and others have advocated for the creation of such a deduction in the past and request that homeowner tax relief be included in the Finance Committees tax extenders package now under consideration
