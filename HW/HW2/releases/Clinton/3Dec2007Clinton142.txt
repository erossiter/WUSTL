December 3  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding Problems Plaguing Indian Point Emergency Preparedness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Clinton  Emergency Preparedness Issues Need to Be On the Table During Relicensing Process                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Since September 11th I have worked to push both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  and Entergy to improve safety  security and emergency preparedness at the plant  Despite improvements in both Entergys management of Indian Point and NRC oversight  problems have persisted at the plant  For example  repeated failures of the sirens have raised questions about emergency preparedness  and leaks from spent fuel pools have prompted safety questions  The steady drumbeat of these and other problems have eroded public confidence in Indian Point  as is clearly demonstrated by the filing today by Governor Spitzer and Attorney General Cuomo    I agree with Governor Spitzer and Attorney General Cuomo that the relicensing process as currently constituted is inadequate to address the unique concerns at Indian Point  a nuclear plant located in one of the densely populated parts of the country  That is why I have pushed for an Independent Safety Assessment to examine these issues and inform the relicensing process  I believe all of these issues need to be on the table during the relicensing process  The existing relicensing process does not review aspects of Indian Point operations that are the subject of routine inspection by NRC  nor does re licensing evaluate emergency preparedness  Unless the NRC is willing to address these issues during the relicensing process  it will be difficult to justify a decision to allow operation of these plants for another 20 years    Senator Clinton has worked to push both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  and Entergy to improve safety  security and emergency preparedness at the plant  including the siren system  Senator Clinton added a provision to the energy bill in 2005 to require Entergy to install a new siren system with battery backup in response to repeated failures of the Indian Point siren system due to a lack of backup power   That provision was signed into law in August of 2005  and the NRC set a January 2007 deadline for having the system operational   Entergy applied for and received an extension of the deadline to April 15th  and subsequently missed the deadline   NRC fined Entergy  130 000 and Senator Clinton announced that she would sponsor Senate companion legislation to a bill to be sponsored in the U S  House by Congresswoman Nita Lowey  D Westchester Rockland  and Congressman John Hall  D Hudson Valley   that would steer fines levied by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for safety violations to counties surrounding nuclear facilities in order to assist them with emergency planning  Earlier this year  Senator Clinton announced that she would be asking the DHS inspector general to evaluate why Entergy has failed meet established deadlines to achieve operability of a new alert and notification system for the Indian Point nuclear power plant  Senator Clinton has also continued to call for the NRC to conduct an Independent Safety Assessment  ISA  at Indian Point and has introduced legislation to require an ISA at the plant     Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning  Indian Point
