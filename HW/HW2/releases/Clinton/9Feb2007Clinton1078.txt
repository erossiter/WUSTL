February 9  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on United States Postal Service to Establish Temporary Postal Facility in Gabriels and to Begin Plans to Reinstate the Original Post Office                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   In a letter sent today to the Postmaster General of the United States  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton requested that the United States Postal Service begin planning to reinstate the permanent Gabriels Post Office and establish a temporary postal facility in the hamlet in the interim  Since a fire in January damaged a large portion of the Gabriels Post Office  residents  mail has been rerouted several miles away           In her letter  Senator Clinton noted that the United States Postal Service has now decided to relocate its postal service from Vermontville to Paul Smiths  so she also called on the Postal Service to issue a quick and efficient notification of this change to the area residents            It is vital that citizens of Gabriel are able to access their mail regularly and conveniently   said Senator Clinton   Getting their mail from Vermontville or Paul Smiths is simply not an option for many who are used to walking each day to the Gabriels Post Office  In an area with no rural mail delivery it is particularly important for senior citizens that a temporary postal service be established in the hamlet of Gabriels  I hope that the Postal Service can establish a temporary facility in Gabriels and start planning to reinstate the Post Office for the long term            On January 30  2007 a fire destroyed approximately one hundred and sixty post office boxes and their contents  Since then local citizens of Gabriels have had to travel six miles away to Vermontville where their mail has been rerouted  The United States Postal Service now has a plan to relocate the temporary facility to the post office at Paul Smiths  This poses a problem for many citizens who walk to pick up their mail  There is no rural mail delivery in Gabriels  making it nearly impossible for those who do not drive to get their mail  This particularly affects many senior citizens who previously had walked to the Gabriels Post Office to retrieve their mail          A copy of Senator Clinton s letter is below       The Honorable John E  Potter  Postmaster General  United States Postal Service  475 L Enfant Plaza  S W    Room 10022  Washington  D C  20260      Dear Mr  Postmaster General          I write on behalf of my constituents to request your assistance in the restoration of postal service in Gabriels  located in Franklin County in northern New York   Press reports indicate that approximately one hundred and sixty post office boxes and the contents of the facility were destroyed in an early morning fire on Tuesday  January 30  2007   The Gabriels postal facility serves the rural areas in this county where I have been informed that there is no rural delivery and many residents  including senior citizens  walk to the Post Office to pick up their mail            I understand that following the fire postal service for the residents of Gabriels and surrounding areas who utilized this facility was originally relocated to Vermontville  which is six miles away   According to recent reports  the United States Postal Service has now decided to relocate the postal service from Vermontville to Paul Smiths bringing service five miles closer   It is vital that there be quick and efficient notification of this change to the area residents            I ask that the United States Postal Service establish a temporary postal facility in Gabriels with the goal of ultimately establishing a permanent facility there   I appreciate your attention to this matter and ask that you keep me and my constituents informed of the process that will be followed in making the decision on whether to return postal service to Gabriels            Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
