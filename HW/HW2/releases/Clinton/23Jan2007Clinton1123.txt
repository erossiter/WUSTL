January 23  2007 Senator Clinton Questions General David Petraeus at Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Senate Clinton   Thank you Mr  Chairman and thank you very much general for your lifetime of service and for taking on this very difficult assignment  I want to begin by associating my remarks with those of Senator Collins  We are in a dire situation  using your adjective  in part because the Congress was supine under the Republican majority  failing to conduct oversight and demanding accountability  and because the President and his team  particularly the former Secretary of Defense  refused to adapt to the changing circumstances on the ground  If this hearing were being held three years ago  I would have a much higher degree of optimism  It has nothing to do with the loyalty  the warrior skills and the leadership of our men and women in uniform  It has everything to do with the years of lost opportunities and the failures of the Iraqis to step up and take responsibility for their own future         It appears also General  that the strategy that is being put forth here inspires skepticism for good reason  Your manual   the Army Marine Corps counterinsurgency manual   as we have already discussed  not only suggests a minimum force level of approximately 120 000  but the manual places great importance on building up internal institutions and training to provide security  This escalation  despite the rhetoric about other goals  places primary emphasis on American military involvement  not Iraqi institutions  The manual makes clear the interconnections of political and military progress that one cannot be achieved without the other         I  ve been quite gratified to hear about all the positive references to Bosnia in this hearing  I can remember very well in 2001 and 2002 hearing nothing but derision about nation building and about peacekeeping and about sufficient levels of force going in to back up whatever the political objectives might be  You will take on a difficult role in Iraq  in a time of peril  based on your leadership and expertise  But what those of us who are issuing resolutions and statements of disapproval fear  is that you are being sent to administer a policy that frankly does not reflect your experience or advice or the experience and advice of our most recent example in dealing with ethnic violence  mainly Bosnia  You wrote the book  General  but the policy is not by the book  And you are being asked to square the circle  to find a military solution to a political crisis  I  among others on this committee  have put forward ideas about disapproving the escalation not because we  in anyway  embrace failure or defeat  but because we are trying to get the attention of our government and the government of Iraq         On my recent trip to Iraq  along with Senator Bayh  our interaction with the Prime Minister and his team did not inspire confidence  What I  speaking for myself  am attempting to do is to send a very clear message to the Iraqi government that they cannot rely on the blood and treasure of America any longer  That we are not going to go into Baghdad and embed our young men and women in very dangerous neighborhoods where we cannot possibly provide force protection because they  the Iraqi government  won  t step up and do what everyone knows what they must do for themselves  So I  very sincerely  but whole heartedly disagree with those who are trying to once again up the rhetoric about our position in Iraq instead of taking a hard look about what will actually  on the ground  change the behavior and actions of this Iraqi government    In the absence of the kind of political full court press that we put on in Bosnia   when I landed in Tuzla  I was briefed by Russians  French  Germans  and Americans  We had an international force  we had an international commitment  we had brought people to the point where they understood that success there was essential to their national security  I see nothing coming from this Administration that it is willing to pursue such a policy now  They won  t talk to bad people  and it is bad people you talk to  in order to try to further political goals  not your friends  They will not put the kind of pressure on a consistent basis on the  Iraqi  government that is required in order to change their behavior  So I have said that I would never cut money for our troops when they  re in harms way  But I would sure threaten to cut money for the Iraqi troops and for the security for the Iraqi leadership  I don  t know how else to get their attention         But one thing I am particularly concerned about is the failure of security for the troops    The incident in Karbala over the weekend is scary  It raises questions that we don  t have answers to  So let me  beyond my statement of joining in the comments of Senator Collins and rejecting those of our other friends on the panel who think that statements of disapproval are somehow going to undermine our effort  when I think they will send the clearest message  We know this policy is going forward  We know the troops are moving  We know that we are likely to not stop this escalation  But we are going to do everything we can to send a message to our government and the Iraqi government that they had better change  because the enemy we are confronting is adaptable  It is intelligent  It learns  It got a hold of our military uniforms  went through those gates after clearing all those police checkpoints  killed five of our soldiers in a meeting talking about security in Iraq  So I don  t believe we are playing with a team on the other side that understands the stakes as we describe them         So the one thing that I would ask General is  please do everything you can to get additional security  The Humvees are turning into death traps  as we see the sophistication of the IEDs  We don  t have enough of the mine protection vehicles and we haven  t even ordered enough and we haven  t put them into the theater  If we  re going to put these soldiers and marines into these very exposed positions  which this strategy calls for  please come to us  ask for whatever you need to try to provide maximum protection  I disapprove of policy  I think it is a dead end  It continues the blank check  but if we  re going to do it  then let  s make sure we have every possible piece of equipment and resource necessary to protect these young men and women that we  re asking to go out and put this policy forward when we  re not doing the political side of the equation that is necessary to maximize the chance for their safety and success        General Petraeus  I  ll do that Senator             Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
