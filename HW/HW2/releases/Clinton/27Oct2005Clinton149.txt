October 27  2005 Senator Clinton Calls For GAO Investigation Into HHS Flu Vaccine Supply and Distribution System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC    With the looming threat of an avian flu outbreak  Senator Clinton today reiterated the need to act now to fix our broken seasonal flu vaccine supply and distribution system so the nation is able to handle the crisis of a worldwide flu pandemic   With reports of seasonal flu vaccine distribution problems in New York and across the country this flu season  Senator Clinton today called on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to launch an immediate investigation into the handling of these ongoing problems by the U S  Department of Health and Human Services   In particular  Senator Clinton asked the GAO to examine HHS efforts to address the communications gap with public health officials  healthcare providers and the general public about our flu vaccine supply and how HHS is addressing the urgent need to create a nationwide vaccine tracking system that is essential not only for responding to the seasonal flu epidemic but an outbreak of avian flu  pandemic or other public health emergency            Experts tell us it  s only a matter of time before avian flu reaches US shores  but HHS is still struggling to mobilize our public health infrastructure to handle the predictable occurrence of the seasonal flu   We need to fix our seasonal flu vaccine production and delivery system now before crisis strikes   That  s why I have introduced legislation to fix our broken flu vaccine system and that  s why it is critical that GAO undertake this investigation               Senator Clinton has introduced legislation with Senator Pat Roberts to help prevent recurring shortages of flu vaccine and strengthen our vaccine delivery infrastructure so that we are able to respond to a crisis  The Clinton Roberts bill  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  addresses the causes of the influenza shortage by bringing increased stability to our nation  s seasonal flu vaccine market  The bill provides a framework through which our public health officials can track vaccines to ensure we have an adequate supply and to make sure high priority populations are vaccinated  The bill also provides technical assistance to companies that wish to produce vaccine domestically  and it will increase education about the importance of obtaining seasonal flu vaccines  The legislation will also strengthen the underlying public health infrastructure in order to heighten our ability to respond to both seasonal and pandemic influenza           Below is the text of Senator Clinton  s letter to the GAO          The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street   N W   Washington  D C   20548         Dear Mr  Walker          In testimony presented before the House Government Reform Committee on June 30  2005  Marcia Crosse  Director of Health Care at the Government Accountability Office  GAO   identified several areas where our response to seasonal influenza vaccination warns of inadequacies in our ability to respond to pandemic influenza   One shortcoming noted by the GAO is the lack of effective communication strategies in sharing public health information with providers and the public   The testimony states that the experiences from the 2004 2005 flu vaccine shortage highlight inconsistencies in messages presented at the federal  state and local level and much confusion as to where correct information could be found          Although it appears unlikely that we will face a vaccine shortage during this year  s flu season  there continue to be communication and vaccine delivery and distribution problems   Reports persist from counties around New York and the nation that adequate supply of flu vaccine is not available and information about its arrival is unknown   Additionally  misconceptions about the vaccine  such as the perception that this year  s seasonal flu shots provide protection against avian flu  continue to persist   The passage of the October 24th deadline for vaccination of high priority populations only increases the confusion and need for additional information and guidance for local public health officials  providers  and the public            However  in response to this clear need for more education and outreach surrounding the delays and confusion  the sole official action of the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  has  to date  been a media briefing   Not only is there a lack of information available to individuals seeking to learn more about our flu vaccine supply and no active efforts on the part of HHS to communicate with local public health officials or providers  but there is also a significant gap in our public health communications infrastructure   Approximately 300 counties around the country are still not linked to the Centers for Disease Control  s  CDC  emergency alert systems  through which the agency can let providers know of shortages or distribution problems    There is also  at the moment  no mechanism through which the government can track vaccine supply and distribution  so that it can ensure that supplies reach high priority populations in a timely manner          I would ask that you investigate these areas and examine the ways in which the Department of Health and Human Services disseminates information about vaccine supply and distribution with state and local health departments  health care providers  health care institutions  and the general public   I am concerned that the information that would assist with the planning and distribution of influenza vaccine is not being adequately distributed to those providing vaccines to the public   If our government cannot adequately inform the public about vaccine distribution  or track the supply and distribution of vaccines around the country during our annual flu season  it further compromises our response to pandemic influenza or other public health crises           In particular  I would ask that you look into the following issues          1  How is the Department coordinating across all relevant agencies to provide a central source of information on the supply of seasonal influenza vaccine  and disseminate such information and guidance to the public health sector  private providers and the public to ensure we are able to successfully vaccinate the public in accordance with the recommendations of the Advisory Council on Immunization Practices           2  What activities is the Department undertaking to guarantee and utilize a public health tracking and surveillance infrastructure that will ensure appropriate distribution and response to vaccine shortages and other public health emergencies  such as a pandemic outbreak          Thank you for your attention to this matter          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
