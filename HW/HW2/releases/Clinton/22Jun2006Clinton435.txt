June 22  2006 Senator Clinton Continues Push to Restore Homeland Security Funding Cuts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today continued her fight to restore misguided cuts to the Homeland Security Grant Program that would slash homeland security funding for New York   In a letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and Full Appropriations Committee  Senator Clinton called for this funding to be reinstated   Senator Clinton announced that if the Appropriators fail to restore this Homeland Security Grant Program funding  she will offer an amendment to the FY2007 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill so that all high risk states and cities    including New York State  New York City  and Buffalo    have ample personnel  equipment  and resources to protect our citizens                We should not be abandoning our states and cities in their work to protect our citizens   The notion that it is suddenly safe to begin reducing our financial support for state and local homeland security and emergency readiness grants  fewer than five years after the September 11th attacks  is both short sighted and dangerous   The recent report in Time magazine that al Qaeda terrorists came within 45 days of releasing a lethal gas into the New York City subway system in 2003 only underscores the critical importance of providing law enforcement agencies in our high threat cities with the resources they need to defend our country against the threat of terrorism     Senator Clinton wrote           Since these ill advised funding cuts were announced last month  New Yorkers have come together in agreement to decry the Department of Homeland Security  s shortsightedness  including families who lost loved ones on September 11th  first responders  and the Wall Street financial services companies with headquarters and operations in New York   They have all called on Secretary Michael Chertoff to reconsider these devastating cuts   During his recent testimony to the House Committee on Homeland Security  Mayor Bloomberg said it best    New York is the nation  s financial capital     its media center     and the headquarters city of the United Nations      Our prominence explains why the streets of Lower Manhattan were the first battleground in the war on terror      Nearly five years after September 11th  New York remains a top target for terrorist attack   The risk assessment performed by the Department of Homeland Security fails to properly account for the threats facing New York and its citizens           The following is the text of Senator Clinton  s letter to the Chairmen and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Full Appropriations Committee          The Honorable Thad Cochran   Chairman     Committee on Appropriations      135 Dirksen Senate Office Building     United States Senate    Washington  D C  20510      The Honorable Judd Gregg  Chairman  Subcommittee on Homeland Security  Committee on Appropriations  135 Dirksen Senate Office Building  United States Senate  Washington  D C   20510      The Honorable Robert C  Byrd  Ranking Member  Committee on Appropriations  S 125A  United States Senate  Washington  D C   20510      Dear Chairmen Cochran and Gregg and Ranking Member Byrd          On May 31  2006  the Department of Homeland Security announced the totals that will be allocated to states and cities pursuant to the FY 2006 Homeland Security Grant Program  HSGP    The results were alarming   Cities and states across the country facing high terrorist threats suffered considerable funding cuts  a fact that can be attributed to a series of highly questionable risk assessments and allocation decisions by the Department   Several cities facing enormous terrorist threats    including New York City and Washington  DC  both of which have already been the target of attacks    were informed that they would see drastic reductions in grant moneys   Funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative alone  one component of the HSGP  was slashed in New York City by more than 40 percent and in Washington  D C  by 43 percent             We should not be abandoning our states and cities in their work to protect our citizens   The notion that it is suddenly safe to begin reducing our financial support for state and local homeland security and emergency readiness grants  fewer than five years after the September 11th attacks  is both short sighted and dangerous   The recent report in Time Magazine that al Qaeda terrorists came within 45 days of releasing a lethal gas into the New York City subway system in 2003 only underscores the critical importance of providing law enforcement agencies in our high threat cities with the resources they need to defend our country against the threat of terrorism             Because the threat we face today is no less imposing than it was before these ill advised cuts  I ask that the Homeland Security and Full Appropriations Committee restore HSGP funding cuts by providing an addition of  674 million to the FY 2006 HSGP   I will continue to fight to restore this funding   If the Committee is unable to restore this funding  I intend to offer an amendment to the FY 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill that increases HSGP funding to enable our high risk states and cities to expend what they need to make sure ample personnel  equipment  and resources are deployed to protect our citizens   Our nation  s high threat states and cities deserve our continuing support as they play their essential part in the protection of our homeland             Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
