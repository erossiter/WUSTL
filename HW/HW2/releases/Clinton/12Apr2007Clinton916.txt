April 12  2007 Clinton Continues to Fight for Our Troops   Veterans    Questions Pentagon and Veterans Affairs Officials About Treatment of Servicemembers and Veterans at Joint Armed Services Veteran Affairs Committee Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                       Clinton Also Presses Deputy Defense Secretary About Pentagon Decision to Extend Deployments and Its Impact on Our Troops       Washington  DC   At a joint Senate Armed Services Committee and Veterans Affairs Committee hearing today  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton addressed the treatment of servicemembers and veterans following her trip to Upstate New York VA and military installations earlier this week             Senator Clinton also highlighted legislation she has introduced to address the challenges facing our servicemembers and to help them get the care they need             At the same hearing  Senator Clinton questioned Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England about the recent announcement by the Department of Defense to extend deployments for active duty personnel  Senator Clinton voiced concern over extending military deployments and the drastic effects it may have on an already overstretched military             The announcement yesterday by Secretary Gates that deployments for active duty will be extended raises serious questions both about the over stretched nature of the Army  which I think is getting to a crisis point  but also how we re going to continue to take care of those people as we put them in harms way for longer and longer periods of time   Our system  despite the best efforts of a lot of well meaning people  is not working commensurate with what we owe those who have served   And I think that looking at these problems that we are addressing today  in the context of this longer deployment  just makes the urgency even greater   said Senator Clinton            A transcript of Senator Clinton s statement at today s hearing follows              Thank you very much Mr  Chairman and thank you gentleman  Before I address the issues that brought us here today  I want to associate myself with the comments of both of the senators from Virginia  Senator Warner and Senator Webb speak from a great deal of experience  And Secretary England  the announcement yesterday by Secretary Gates that deployments for active duty will be extended raises serious questions both about the over stretched nature of the Army  which I think is getting to a crisis point  but also how we re going to continue to take care of those people as we put them in harms way for longer and longer periods of time   Our system  despite the best efforts of a lot of well meaning people  is not working commensurate with what we owe those who have served   And I think that looking at these problems that we are addressing today  in the context of this longer deployment  just makes the urgency even greater   And I hope that the suggestions that have been talked about today from General Scott s commission and others will be put on the fastest of tracks and work with the Congress to please get some answers to these problems         I spent Tuesday at the VA in Syracuse  New York and also up at Fort Drum where I met with more than 40 returning active duty soldiers   They ve been wounded and injured in both Iraq and Afghanistan   And I had a very frank discussion with them and I asked them what their situation was and here s what I heard  loss of their medical records was a constant refrain  something that I ve heard continually   One young soldier  who was wounded by an IED in Bagdad  said that as he was being rolled out on his gurney to get on the plane to go back to Landstuhl and a nurse put a packet on his chest and said   These are your medical records  don t lose them             He said   You know Ma am  I didn t get to Landstuhl with my medical records    I hear that over and over again            Physical Evaluation Board liaison officers who lack training or are just too busy  or no caseworker at all  lack of legal assistance for the appeals process  unfair determinations  at least in the minds of many of the soldiers certainly on a basis of comparability due to the administrative and bureaucratic burdens placed on soldiers   We ve talked a lot today about the disability system  but I don t think it accurately reflects TBI or PTSD  amputations  hearing loss and diseases that  since the first Gulf War  we have seen in some increase in numbers as military members have returned             And then one issue  which has not been mentioned and I want to put on the table  is that Traumatic Servicemembers Group Life insurance  which has been the subject of just anguished reports to me   As you know  this is an insurance policy that many of our soldiers sign up for and as of August 2006  over 41 percent of the claims have been denied   And what I heard at Fort Drum was that it s almost a joke   They call numbers  nobody answers   They get hung up on   They re basically told  here s the way it works  we turn you down and if you have the energy come back  maybe we ll do something for you  This is a disgrace and it s something that one Sergeant told me just made him laugh instead of cry   His convoy had been hit by an IED   He had severe injuries and the life insurance representatives told him that he d have to prove that he had been injured when he had his commanders  his doctors and everybody else already having made that case   I think this needs to be looked at seriously and I hope Mr  Chairman  we take a look at it as well  because from what I m hearing it is not performing the way it should            I also heard there is not a single neurosurgeon deployed to Afghanistan   And one of the problems we re having with head injuries is that people are sent directly from Afghanistan to Landstuhl   That s a long trip under often stressful circumstances   At the very least I hope  Secretary England  we can get a neurosurgical team to Bagram so that we have the facilities and the personnel there ready to take care of our young men and women            I also was distressed to learn that Fort Drum does not have a caseworker assigned to assist wounded soldiers navigating to the disability process   A few months ago  the only caseworker assigned to the post was reassigned to an administrative position   Then I heard from soldier after soldier that had it not been for this particular caseworker  they would ve been really lost   When I asked the commanders  they told me they are not authorized to spend budget dollars from operating and maintenance accounts to hire caseworkers because they are paid from a separate medical personnel fund  which is not under the control of the base commanders   Again  I think we need to look at that  One thing that these soldiers need is somebody to help them navigate through this process and for them to feel like they have someone on their side   To follow up on Senator Webb s question  perhaps we could consider asking retired personnel to volunteer to assist us in reducing this backlog   I think we need to put as much energy and urgency into this as possible          And finally  with respect to the electronic medical records  the VA system gets very high marks  not just within the VA system itself  but by external independent assessments   And yet  I hear the DoD electronic medical records system is plagued by failure to comply problems   People just don t want to do it and apparently they re not ordered to do it   Lots of slips with the information getting from the battle field into the system   And I just think it would be a smart  efficient approach to look at taking the VistA System in VA  which is an already functioning  effective system that has a proven track record  and extending it to DoD   Instead of trying to figure out how to merge and create a new system  let s go with what works  because I think there are too many records that are being lost and people are literally falling through the cracks   Mr  Chairman  I have a series of questions related to TBI and the legislation that I and Senator Collins  and I and Senator Bayh have introduced and I d like to submit those for the record               Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning veterans
