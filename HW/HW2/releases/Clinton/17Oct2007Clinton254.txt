October 17  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Senate Banking Committee Passage of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In the days that followed the attacks of September 11th  in addition to the terrible human suffering and the massive loss of life  nearly every sector of our economy faced extreme uncertainty     In response  Congress had the wisdom to pass the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act which provided a federal backstop to enable insurance coverage against terrorist attacks which the private insurance market could not provide  That legislation was vital to the recovery and rebuilding efforts in Lower Manhattan and in the five years since it was enacted  TRIA has given assurances to investors  to builders and to workers that whatever emergencies we face  we will have the means and the will to rebuild  repair and reinvest so that acts of terrorism cannot disrupt the long term strength of our economy       TRIA has been a success  and I am pleased that the Senate Banking Committee has taken action to extend it beyond its expiration at the end of this year  There is no question that it has helped to make terrorism insurance available in most parts of the country   To be clear  TRIA is not just about New York but its an issue of national economic security     While I certainly would have preferred a longer term extension of the TRIA and improvements still need to be made to the bill to address the unique insurance coverage issues in New York City  I believe that this bill is an overwhelmingly positive step and I am hopeful that Congress sends a final bill to the Presidents desk quickly
