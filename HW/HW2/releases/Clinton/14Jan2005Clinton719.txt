January 14  2005 Schumer  Clinton  Slaughter  Reynolds and  Higgins Call on Department of Labor to  Look Harder for Bethlehem Steel Records                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Letter Asks Department to Follow Leads Identified  in Recent Draft Audit of Bethlehem Steel Site Profile                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   Senators Chuck Schumer  NY  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  were joined by Representatives Louise Slaughter  NY   Tom Reynolds  NY  and Brian Higgins  NY  in writing to the Department of Labor  DOL  to request an immediate search for additional records about uranium rollings conducted at the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna  NY during the 1950s         Under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA   DOL has the responsibility to set eligibility dates for former Bethlehem Steel workers by determining when uranium was rolled at the plant  In spite of former workers  assertions that uranium rollings took place in 1955 and 1956  DOL has denied the EEOICPA claims of workers employed during these years  stating that no relevant records have been found        However  a recent draft audit of the Bethlehem Steel  site profile   conducted by Sanford Cohen and Associates  points to several places where records of Bethlehem Steel uranium rollings might be found  Specifically  the draft audit points to Department of Energy facilities at Savannah River  Hanford and the Chalk River Reactor as well the Bethlehem Steel facility in Saylorsville  Pennsylvania  The letter asks DOL to immediately search these facilities or to release information showing that they have done so already  In addition  the letter asks DOL to answer several questions about the methods and information they used to arrive at the eligibility dates for Bethlehem Steel          The Department of Labor should leave no stone unturned in the search for Bethlehem Steel records   said Senator Clinton   We need to be able to assure Bethlehem Steel workers and their survivors that we have looked in every possible place for records of the uranium rollings          The Department of Labor needs to step up its efforts now to find each and every piece of evidence that will help these workers get the money they deserve   Senator Schumer said   These workers can t wait another minute to find information that could make a difference to their claims           Workers have steadfastly maintained they rolled uranium at Bethlehem Steel in 1955 and 1956  The Labor Department can t say it didn t happen if they haven t bothered to investigate  The United States government has a responsibility to the people of New York to conduct a full and thorough investigation  Anything less is simply indefensible   Congresswoman Slaughter said         No one who deserves compensation should have it denied  period   said Congressman Reynolds   These records could provide many of the answers needed to ensure the compensation that these these veterans of the cold war deserve  Furthermore  it will show that the federal government will leave no stone unturned to ensure we meet our responsibility  and provide fairness to these workers and their families           This is the next step to make sure that our affected constituents get the consideration they deserve   said Congressman Brian Higgins   I am proud to be united with my colleagues in the Western New York Congressional Delegation in our effort to ensure that the Department of Labor does not leave anyone out          The full text of the letter follows        January 14  2005       Mr  Shelby Hallmark  Director  Office of Workers  Compensation Programs  U S  Department of Labor  200 Constitution Ave   SW  Washington  DC 20210       Dear Mr  Hallmark        The Department of Labor  DOL  stated in its recent DOL Comments on the SC Audit of the Bethlehem Steel Site Profile that they are  responsible for establishing the time period for which a  covered facility  is deemed covered          During the December 2004 meeting of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health in Livermore  CA  it was reported that DOL has adjudicated and denied claims for compensation submitted under Subtitle B of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act  EEOICPA  that are based on exposure during alleged uranium rollings during the 1955 1956 time period at the Bethlehem Steel facility in Lackawanna  NY        The Sanford Cohen and Associates  Inc   SC  audit team  in their review of the Bethlehem Steel site profile  stated that   A comprehensive records search of relevant rolling operations documents was not performed to investigate worker testimony regarding additional rollings after 1952   The audit team recommended that NIOSH direct a further investigation into the statements by the appropriate agency         Additionally  recently discovered records from the Hanford facility provide valuable supporting documentation for Bethlehem Steel  as evident by their inclusion in the references of the audit report  In light of the discovery of records at Hanford  SC recommended that a further search of records be completed at Hanford and that similar searches be completed for the MCW  SRS and Chalk River facilities  as they either provided uranium for rolling or received the finished product from Bethlehem Steel  The audit team also recommended that the Bethlehem Steel records repository in Saylorsville  PA  Be searched for evidence of rolling history        In light of these audit findings and recommendations  we request the following information and actions be taken with respect to the Bethlehem Steel facility        1  Please describe the investigative process that DOL follows with regard to Subtitle B claims asserting that there were covered activities outside of the time periods listed in the Federal Register notices published periodically by the Department of Energy  DOE         2  With respect to the DOL s process  please provide the factual basis for the denials of claims related to reports that there were rollings at Bethlehem Steel in 1955 and 1956        3  Please provide a description of the inquiry undertaken by DOL  or requests for investigations by DOE or NIOSH  to determine if rollings took place in 1955 56  Please attach copies of emails  letters  and reports from DOE field offices that describe the specific efforts undertaken and by whom this research was conducted  Please provide copies of all documents that were recovered        4  Did DOL or other federal agencies  such as DOE  direct a review of uranium shipment records at Savannah River  Hanford and the Chalk River Reactor to determine if shipments were made from Bethlehem Steel  or an intermediary  to these three facilities in 1955 56  If so  please provide copies of documents  If not  we urge DOL to initiative such a review immediately  as we note that DOE has uncovered a significant amount of shipment data in connection with its mass balance report on recycled uranium         5  Did DOL or another federal agency  including the DOE  make an inquiry to Bethlehem Steel to determine if they have pertinent records related to additional rollings  and to request a search of their Saylorsville  PA records facility  If not  we urge DOL to initiate such an inquiry immediately  We note that DOL now possesses new subpoena authority through amendments to the FY 05 Defense Authorization Act  P L  108 375  which will allow DOL to compel production of records        We respectfully request that you make this information available to us and the public at the earliest opportunity  We also request that DOL initiate any unperformed review or inquiry described above that might uncover information about uranium rollings after 1952  These actions and information are critical to Bethlehem Steel claimants  as evidenced by the strong turnout and comments at the NIOSH public meeting on January 12 in Cheektowaga  NY  The public deserves to be assured that DOL has taken all possible steps to attain information about uranium rollings at Bethlehem Steel  and to be fully informed about the factual basis DOL is using for uranium         Please contact any of our offices in regards to this request        Sincerely
