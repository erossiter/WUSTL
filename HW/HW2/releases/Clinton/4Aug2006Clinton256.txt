             Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Patrick Leahy  D VT   Jim Jeffords  I VT  and Charles Schumer  D NY  are calling on their colleagues on the Senate Subcommittee on National Parks to hold a hearing on the Hudson Fulton Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Commission Act of 2006   With only three years to go until the commemorations of the famous voyages  the Senators are anxious to have the legislation passed so that coordinated plans can get under way  Senator Clinton introduced the Hudson Fulton Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Commission Act of 2006 earlier this year to establish the Champlain Quadricentennial Commemoration Commission and the Hudson Fulton Commemoration Commission           2009 will mark the 400th anniversary of the voyage of Henry Hudson  the first European to sail up the Hudson River  the 400th anniversary of the voyage of Samuel de Champlain  the first European to discover and explore Lake Champlain  and the 200th anniversary of the voyage of Robert Fulton  the first person to use steam navigation on a commercial basis   The Commemoration Commissions will be established to coordinate educational  cultural and historical projects while cooperating and assisting the programs and activities conceived by New York and Vermont  The Commissions will also be responsible for facilitating nation wide and international celebration efforts  It is also hoped that the Commissions will support and facilitate marketing efforts for a commemorative coin  commemorative stamp and other related activities             These anniversaries give us a unique opportunity to celebrate our history and to draw tourists into the region  It might seem like a long time  but we only have three years to really get everything organized on a federal level so that we can take maximum advantage of commemoration events and celebrations  I hope our Senate colleagues recognize the importance of these opportunities to our states and move forward on this bill     Senator Clinton said            With the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Samuel De Champlain in 2009  Vermonters  New Yorkers and our many visitors will take the opportunity to celebrate a rich heritage     said Leahy     I urge the Committee to consider this legislation to assist the residents and communities in the Lake Champlain region commemorate one of America  s cultural  historic and environmental treasures               This is a great opportunity for Vermont and New York to work together to celebrate our shared history  from a time when the great waterways of the region were the superhighways of their day     said Senator Jim Jeffords  ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee            These voyages opened up and transformed the North American continent  and the lives of Europeans and Native Americans would never be the same again     Senator Schumer said    Thanks to Hudson and Champlain  Europeans became able for the first time to penetrate the heart of the continent and begin creating the civilization that we know here today   Fulton two hundreds years later revolutionized our world once again by making travel and commerce easier and faster by means of steam power   We ve got to pass this legislation now so preparations for these important celebrations less than three years from now can start moving forward              A copy of the Senators   letter is below          August 3  2006      The Honorable Craig Thomas  Chairman                                    Subcommittee on

establishment of trading posts  military posts  and settlements as far south as Lake George  From these early establishments came trade  commerce  cultural  and religious impact deep into the Mohawk Valley and as far west as Lake Erie  These settlements influenced our Nation  s history  culture  law  commerce  and traditions of liberty that extend to the present day   Almost 200 years later  in
