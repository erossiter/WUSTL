July 1  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding the BRAC Commission  s Possible Additions to the Base Closure List                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            I  m extremely pleased that no New York installations were included in the list of installations that the BRAC commission is considering adding to the closure list   It is a testament to the role that these installations are playing in supporting our national security and homeland defense   I am also encouraged that the Commission is looking at the Department of Defense  s Defense Finance and Accounting Service and Air National Guard recommendations   I think this demonstrates that the Commission is taking our arguments in support of the Niagara Falls air base and the Rome DFAS facilities seriously
