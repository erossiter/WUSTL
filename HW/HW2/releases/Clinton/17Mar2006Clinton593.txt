March 17  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the New Source Review                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington  DC      I have always believed that the Administration  s changes to the New Source Review program clearly violated the Clean Air Act  and that is why I filed an amicus brief in this case   Today that view was validated by the DC Circuit Court   The truth about the Administration  s rule should now be clear  it was an attempt to circumvent Congress and gut the Clean Air Act for the benefit of polluters and at the expense of public health   This is a huge victory for clean air and the health of New Yorkers
