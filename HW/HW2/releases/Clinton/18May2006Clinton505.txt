May 18  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC      I am deeply concerned that the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee has approved a bill reauthorizing the Ryan White CARE Act that will penalize New York for playing by the rules and deny New York its fair share of HIV AIDS funding          New York has long been  and still remains  the area with the greatest burden from this epidemic  New York has more cases than any other state in the nation  with over 100 000 individuals living with HIV and AIDS  Over 6 000 New Yorkers were diagnosed with HIV in the last year for which we have data   Our state has responded to the tremendous need  working to devote both local and state resources  as well as those provided through the Ryan White CARE Act  to set up systems that are models of care   We also complied with requirements to establish a CDC certified HIV case reporting system  so that we could better treat our epidemic within our state  when many other states did not           This reauthorization sets up a funding mechanism that does not adequately recognize the efforts  needs and contributions of New York State   I am particularly concerned that this bill gives states who did not comply with the CDC reporting requirements a proxy that allows them to estimate HIV and AIDS cases but denies this proxy to New York  a state that has followed the law and adopted the more stringent CDC requirement to certify the precise number of cases   The application of this proxy will result in massive funding shifts away from New York State  as well as Texas  Florida  and other states which have  for many years  borne the brunt of this epidemic  Redistributing millions of dollars from New York and other states where both city and local governments have made significant contributions to AIDS care and treatment will only hurt people who are living with HIV  and result in difficulty accessing care          New York State remains at the epicenter of this epidemic  as we have for years and continues to be a leader in treatment and services for its citizens who suffer from HIV and AIDS  The support provided by the Ryan White CARE Act was not only critical in 1990  when it was first enacted  but remains a vital part of New York  s system of HIV AIDS treatment and care services  New York has followed the law and played by the rules and loss of this funding is unacceptable and would fundamentally undermine what New York has accomplished  severely impacting those infected and affected by AIDS   I will continue to fight to reverse these cuts to make sure that New York receives its fair share of funding and that New Yorkers living with HIV and AIDS have the care they need and deserve
