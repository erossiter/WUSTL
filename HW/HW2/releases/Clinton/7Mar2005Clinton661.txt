March 7  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Minimum Wage Votes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC     It is our responsibility to do right by hardworking Americans by giving them the tools they need to be self sufficient  But today by defeating the Kennedy amendment  the Senate denied millions of workers a bridge out of poverty and an opportunity to make a living from work        The minimum wage is one of the most direct tools the federal government has to help people rise out of poverty and become self sufficient  Yet Congress hasn t voted to increase the minimum wage since 1997 when it raised the minimum wage to its current level of  5 15 an hour  Since 1997  wage growth  inflation and the recession have eroded the buying power of the minimum wage        Nearly seven and a half million workers would benefit directly from a minimum wage increase  including 500 000 in New York alone  More than eight million more workers making just above the minimum wage would also benefit as the income floor rises  That s fifteen and a half million workers who will get a raise         Women make up over 60 percent of those who would benefit directly from a minimum wage increase and over 30 percent of these women are African American or Hispanic  This is particularly significant for my state of New York  which has one of the greatest numbers of low wage working women in the country        While the Kennedy amendment would have been a real step forward for working families  the Santorum amendment would have been a step back  The Santorum amendment represented an all out assault on the paychecks of hardworking New Yorkers and working families in communities across the country  It would have cut overtime pay and worker protections under cover of a paltry increase in pay for a small number of low wage workers        By passing a real increase in the minimum wage  we can say with our actions what we all know in our hearts    people who work hard and play by the rules should not live in poverty  I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to continue the fight to pass an increase in the minimum wage this Congress
