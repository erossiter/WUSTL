October 17  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Concerning Tishman Speyer  s Winning Bid for Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   In response to the news that Tishman Speyer won the bid to purchase Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village  I reached out to Jerry Speyer today to express my fundamental belief that maintaining affordable housing for the tens of thousands who live there should be a top priority   I look forward to working with the new buyers and the residents towards a solution that honors the history of this neighborhood as well as our shared belief that hard working New Yorkers deserve an affordable place to live          Since the very beginning  I have supported efforts to ensure that Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village remain affordable  That s why in private conversation with the CEO of MetLife and publicly  I urged MetLife to recognize its obligation as a corporate citizen of New York to work with the residents to ensure that the housing remains affordable and requested that MetLife take seriously the tenant bid          Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village were developed in the years after World War II and they reflect our shared American values    giving people the opportunity to do well  demanding responsibility and hard work  and building a strong community   It s essential that we continue to work towards those goals
