June 1  2007 Clinton  King Call on Army Corps of Engineers to Address Jones Inlet Safety Concerns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Call on Army Corps to Work with Coast Guard to Determine and Mark the Safest Channel Through the Inlet and Alleviate Dangerous Conditions  Washington  DC  Responding to ever deteriorating conditions at Jones Inlet  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Peter King are calling on the U S  Army Corps of Engineers to act immediately to address serious safety concerns on the waterway     Senator Clinton and Representative King have consistently called for the Inlet to be dredged to alleviate the safety risk posed by the severe shoaling that has occurred in the channel  but in the interim  they are calling on the Army Corps to work with the Coast Guard to monitor the channel so the best and safest channel can be marked for boaters  In a letter to the Chief of Engineers  Lieutenant General Robert L  Van Antwerp  Clinton and King also asked that a new survey be undertaken to understand the type of boating traffic that is using the waterway    The Jones Inlet remains extremely hazardous for commercial and recreational boating and for the surrounding communities  The time to address these concerns is now  said Senator Clinton  I have repeatedly called upon the Army Corps of Engineers to address this important and immediate issue  I hope the Army Corps is receptive to these concerns and the concerns of the community and addresses the safety risks as soon as possible    Since last year  I have been urging the Army Corps and the State of New York to move forward with the dredging of Jones Inlet  said King  Until that happens  immediate action must be taken to make the navigation of the channel as safe as possible  We cannot let this go another day  It is just too risky    This request marks the continuation of Senator Clinton and Representative Kings efforts to alleviate the dangerous conditions present at the Jones Inlet  In 2005  Senator Clinton and Rep  Peter King called on the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge Jones Inlet as it had not been dredged for over 10 years and had resulted in severe shoaling and a significant safety hazard for both recreational and commercial boating  The erosion of the shoreline along Point Lookout also poses a dangerous threat    A copy of the Clinton King letter is below     May 31  2007   Lieutenant General Robert L  Van Antwerp  USA Chief of Engineers United States Army Corps of Engineers The Pentagon Washington  D C  20310   Dear General Antwerp    We write to express our concern regarding the dangerous conditions present at the Jones Inlet federal navigation channel  As you are aware  we have written on several occasions to the Army Corps of Engineers on the importance of dredging the Inlet and alleviating the safety risk posed by the severe shoaling that has occurred in the channel     Given the deteriorating condition of the Inlet  we respectfully ask that you work with the Coast Guard to monitor the channel so the best and safest channel can be marked for boaters  It has been brought to our attention that the buoy placement marking the channel could be updated to better reflect the current state of the Inlet  We are pleased to hear that the Army Corps recently completed a conditional survey of the Inlet  Please coordinate this information  and work accordingly  with the Coast Guard to determine and mark the safest channel through the Inlet     It is also our understanding that Jones Inlet has been classified by the Army Corps as a non commercial inlet  Our offices have met with concerned residents of the Point Lookout boating community who feel that the data used to make that determination is outdated  and that a new survey of those using the Inlet would show that the Inlet should in fact be deemed commercial  We ask that in your assessment of the Inlet you consider the potential commercial and recreational use of the inlet if the conditions were not as dangerous as they are currently  These are important issues about the nature of the Inlet and those who use it  and we request the Army Corps explore these factors and provide us with an update on your findings    Thank you in advance for your consideration    Sincerely     Hillary Rodham Clinton  Peter T  King
