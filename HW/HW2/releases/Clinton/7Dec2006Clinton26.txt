December 7  2006 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on The Resolution of a Federal Panel Regarding Electronic Voting Machines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC      The unanimous resolution by the Technical Guidelines Development Committee of the U S  Election Assistance Commission that voting systems should have an independent means for verifying election results confirms the need for reforms that I have urged for years   We must strengthen our electoral system so that our basic democratic values are protected even as voting technology and threats to the franchise evolve   We need to adopt reforms to our election system so that we can say with confidence that we count every vote and that every vote counts           It is why I introduced the Count Every Vote Act following widespread problems during the 2004 election and plan to reintroduce this important comprehensive election reform legislation when Congress returns next year   My bill addresses the problems that have plagued our most recent federal elections and provides a practical way for our nation to meet these challenges and restore the American people  s faith in our voting process   The bill ensures that a voter verified paper ballot is provided for every vote cast on electronic voting machines   It improves security measures for electronic voting machines and includes a ban on using undisclosed software and wireless communications devices in voting systems   Among other things  my legislation also protects voters from deceptive practices and conflicts of interest that impede voters   trust in the electoral system            Our election laws need to reflect our democratic values   The time to pass meaningful election reform efforts like my Count Every Vote Act is long overdue   I have tremendous confidence that under the strong leadership of Senator Dianne Feinstein  the Senate Rules Committee will champion election reform   I look forward to working closely with her so that we can restore the American people  s confidence in our elections and ensure them that their vote has indeed counted
