January 23  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the State of the Union Address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Washington  DC      There is no doubt that the state of our union needs to be much stronger   We face tremendous challenges in Iraq and Afghanistan  continuing threats to our national and homeland security and crises here at home in health care and energy   But tonight  the President fell far short of the vision and solutions needed to meet these challenges and move our country forward            The President finally acknowledged the problem of global warming and the need to develop alternative energy sources  but he did not offer a real plan to deal with climate change or to put us on a path to energy independence   The President finally addressed the need to deal with the health care crisis  but offered a proposal that does nothing to make health insurance more affordable or accessible for the millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans   The President called for No Child Left Behind to be reauthorized this year  but has failed to ensure the funding needed to fulfill the promise of this landmark law   And instead of charting a new course in Iraq  including the political solution desperately needed  so that we can begin to bring our troops home  the President continued his defense of failed strategy and his escalation plan in Iraq          Sadly  there was so much that the President left unsaid  including the need to help the thousands of responders  workers and others suffering devastating health effects from their exposure to the toxic fumes and dust at Ground Zero   Tonight  we lost another of our 9 11 heroes   Cesar Borja was a retired NYPD police officer who worked at Ground Zero   He started getting sick in the summer of 2002 with a cough that wouldn  t stop   After a series of misdiagnoses  in the fall of 2006 he was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis that tonight took his life   His son  Caesar Borja  Jr   had traveled today to Washington as my guest to attend the State of the Union address as a reminder to the President of our continuing obligation to help those who sacrificed their lives and health in the aftermath of 9 11   As we mourn the loss of Cesar Borja and keep the Borja family tonight in our thoughts and prayers  we are reminded that thousands like Cesar Borja desperately need help and I hope that the President in his budget will provide the funding needed to provide the health care our 9 11 heroes need and deserve           It is time for bold but practical solutions   And it is past time to take the steps needed to create opportunity again for our families  our communities and our children
