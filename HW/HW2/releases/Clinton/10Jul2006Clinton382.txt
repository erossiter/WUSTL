July 10  2006 Senator Clinton s Letter to Constituents on the Accomplishments of the 109th Congress                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Dear Friend          As we wrap up the second session of the 109th Congress  I want to take this opportunity to share with you just some of the progress we have made for New York this past year  Recently  you expressed an interest in learning about my work in the Senate  I am pleased to offer this broad look at the previous year s initiatives and achievements           At a time when we face great challenges to our economy  our security  and our values  we have made strides for our state  I am proud to have worked on your behalf  every single day  When traveling throughout New York   I am always heartened by the hope and optimism of New York  s families  Having spoken with many of you about your concerns  I have worked hard in the Senate to honor my duty to you  to represent the interests of all New Yorkers  I am proud of all that we accomplished and remain hopeful that we will continue to achieve great things for our state         Securing our Economy  Protecting our Communities Investing in Education  Strengthening our Health Care System and Improving Public Health Preparedness   Standing Up for Seniors Promoting Energy Independence   Standing with our Armed Forces and Veterans  Standing up for Children and Families       Securing our Economy     Working together  I firmly believe that our state can compete and succeed in the 21st century economy  Joining with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  I have stood up for an economy that works for people by promoting small businesses  manufacturing  agriculture  and tourism  by seeking federal investment in infrastructure  and by forging new economic partnerships between the public and private sectors  businesses large and small  investors  and young people looking for good jobs in our communities        Agriculture  Together with New York States growers  distributors  retailers  restaurateurs  and others  we are expanding access to markets for New York  s agricultural products  particularly in downstate regions such as New York City   That is the goal of my  Farm to Fork  initiative which has continued to develop this year  We continue to make the connections needed to support our farmers and rural communities  to develop new institutional markets such as schools and colleges  and to make healthy  locally grown food more accessible to all children and communities           Last summer  for example  I launched with FoodLink a regional distribution center that helps local farmers in the Finger Lakes and Greater Rochester Region reach broader markets  For small farmers   and for local businesses looking to buy local produce   the lack of an effective distribution network was a challenge  and FoodLink will help farmers overcome that challenge  I also continue to promote value added opportunities for our New York state producers  such as organic agriculture  and was pleased to co host an organic workshop for farmers  educators  and extension agents at Alfred State College in Western New York this past spring  We also convened a meeting in the Hudson Valley with representatives of private colleges and universities to promote New York agriculture           In Washington   I continue to work with my Senate colleagues to fight for federal programs and legislation that provide critical safety nets for our New York producers  I fought hard to extend the Milk Income Lost Contract  MILC   which was extended until the next farm bill  and strongly opposed the milk tax on dairy farmers that the Administration proposed at the beginning of this year  I have also been a strong advocate for full funding of programs that will help improve the competitiveness of our specialty crop growers  In addition  I will continue to urge the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  to provide the needed disaster assistance when natural calamities hit  such as the recent flooding in the Southern Tier and Central New York         Alternative Minimum Tax  Once again the Congress enacted a temporary fix to the Alternative Minimum Tax  or AMT  which is affecting more and more middle class families and leading to unexpected and unfair tax burdens   While a long term solution is needed  our AMT  patch  will prevent some 2 9 million New York taxpayers from being caught by the AMT        Infrastructure  In March of this year  I joined with a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce the National Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2006  legislation to address the deteriorating conditions of our nation s roads  bridges  drinking water systems  dams  and other public works  The bill would create a National Commission on Infrastructure of the United States   charged with investing in infrastructure to meet current demands and the demands of future economic growth  In fact  the American Society of Civil Engineers has estimated that we confront a  1 6 trillion need for infrastructure improvements  In addition  last year we passed into law a transportation bill that will bring over  16 billion to New York State to meet our growing highway and transit needs over the next several years  For the future of New York  s economy and communities  we must invest in our roadways  bridges  buses  tunnels  ferries  and transportation infrastructure        Manufacturing  Joining with my colleague  Senator Lindsey Graham  we created the Manufacturing Caucus  to draw attention to challenges facing manufacturers in New York and around the country and to develop policies that will ensure America  s continuing competitiveness in the global economy  Two recent Manufacturing Caucus meetings have focused on the relationship between the defense industry and manufacturing and on the need for continued investments in research  development  and education to sustain the strength of American manufacturing  Good paying manufacturing jobs helped create a strong and vibrant middle class in America and ensuring the strength of the manufacturing sector in a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive economy is crucial           As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  I have been pleased to advocate for New York  s defense industry and this past year we were successful in securing tens of millions of dollars for New York  s first rate defense companies        New Partnerships  To foster good jobs  promote our businesses  and keep economic growth right here in our state  I have continued to work closely with a private sector venture called New Jobs for New York   This not for profit effort  which I have supported from its inception and continue to support as chair of its advisory board  brings New York  s investment dollars to entrepreneurs and small businesses across our state  So far  this partnership has joined more than 275 New York businesses with investors through ten conferences and connected more than 3 400 entrepreneurs  investors and researchers from across New York   New Jobs for New York also works to connect our state s young people with career opportunities  so that our talented students realize their potential in our communities  We have recently held a conference on emerging technology on Long Island  a telecommunications summit in Albany   and an event to promote Rochester and New York State as a renewable energy leader  We also held a collegiate job and internship fair in Syracuse   making the connections that we hope will keep our young people right here in New York            Also  in December  education institutions  non profit organizations  and local businesses gathered at Schenectady County Community College to discuss how we can continue to develop the world class workforce necessary for the Tech Valley   For several years  working with local companies  organizations  and community leaders  we have opened up new markets to small businesses through trading cooperatives that help entrepreneurs sell their products online  We continue to expand the Finger Lakes Trading Cooperative to additional counties and our trading cooperative in the North Country continues to add entrepreneurs and local companies        Protecting Privacy  A concern that many New Yorkers have expressed to me more and more frequently is their privacy   and the risks to privacy posed by a more interconnected  information driven economy  That is why I will introduce a Privacy Bill of Rights   comprehensive legislation designed to protect privacy rights and guard against identity theft  Individuals ought to have the right to know and correct information being kept about them  the right to know how their information is being used by private companies  and the right to hold the public and private sectors to the highest standards of care with personal data and information        Raising the Minimum Wage  I also believe that Congress should stand up for an economy that works for people  That is why I have continued to call for an increase in the minimum wage   which has not been raised for nearly a decade  In that time  members of Congress have raised their own salaries by tens of thousands of dollars  My legislation  the Standing with Minimum Wage Earners Act  would make sure that  if members of Congress get a pay increase  so do minimum wage workers        Small Businesses  I have supported legislation that allows small businesses to immediately expense up to  100 000 in equipment and capital investments   We also saved the Small Business Administration s Program for Investments in Microentrepreneurs  PRIME   which provides training and technical assistance to low income entrepreneurs   Last year  this critical program which serves many small businesses throughout New York was eliminated in the President s budget   We fought to include  2 million for this program and we will be working to ensure that this program is funded again this year         Return to top   Protecting our Communities     As your Senator  I believe my most important responsibility is working to secure our nation and to keep our communities safe  Since September 11th  2001  we have come to understand new dangers but we must do more to make the investments in security that these new dangers require  which includes protecting against and preparing for disasters   both manmade and natural           Late last year  the Congress passed  250 million for the E 911 grant program  to upgrade and improve our nation s emergency communications system  In New York   over half of the 911 calls placed each year are made on cell phones  Unfortunately  many towns and cities in New York and throughout the country lack the technology to pinpoint the location of these calls  These funds will be dedicated to grants that will enhance emergency communications services through planning  infrastructure improvements  equipment purchases and personnel training   vital in the post 9 11 world           I have also introduced legislation to ensure that our first responders have an interoperable emergency communications system coordinated under federal leadership   Nearly five years after September 11  our emergency communications systems are still unprepared for the realities of a crisis   My bill will close this gap in our preparedness and make sure first responders on the ground from different jurisdictions are using compatible communications technology and receive the technological  logistical and financial support from the federal government necessary to address this priority           I also continue to fight for threat based funding so that our homeland security dollars are distributed based on the facts on the ground instead of politics in Washington   Sadly  often our progress these days is gauged by the bad decisions we prevent  we must continue to fight the misguided cuts to the Homeland Security Grant Program proposed by the Department of Homeland Security that would slash funding for New York            Over the past twelve months  I have also called for tighter controls on nuclear materials  introduced legislation to block foreign governments from controlling United States ports  and continued to fight for a real commitment to security at our ports and railways  In May of this year  for instance  I joined a bipartisan coalition of senators to introduce comprehensive transportation security legislation  it has been almost five years since the devastating attacks of 9 11 and  sadly  we still do not have an adequate and comprehensive approach to homeland security  I fear we are leaving our ports  our rail systems  and our cities open to great risk   and we must fight for the safeguards necessary to protect against that risk           I also believe that an important part of defending our communities is supporting the first responders who truly are on the front line of our defense  In September of last year  I introduced with several colleagues legislation to provide free medical screenings to first responders  volunteers  and emergency personnel who respond   at great personal risk   to disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the terrorist attacks of 9 11           Joining with New York  s other Senator  Senator Charles E  Schumer  and House members from both sides of the aisle  we were able to restore  125 million for injured 9 11 workers  Those funds had been approved as part of the emergency recovery aid passed in the aftermath of the attacks  but President Bush had proposed to take back the promised funding  That was unacceptable  and  working together  we reversed the decision           We all saw in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina the challenges that remain in effectively responding to crises and emergencies  The response we all witnessed along the Gulf Coast was unworthy of America and I believe it is my duty  as your Senator  to stand up and demand answers  These many years after September 11  2001  all Americans had every right to expect better  In September of 2005  and in recent months  I have called for the creation of an independent national commission  modeled on the 9 11 Commission  to investigate what went wrong in our response and how we can make it right  I also introduced a bill to create that commission and to restore the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA    our nation s emergency response agency   to its rightful place as an independent  cabinet level agency that reports directly to the President of the United States           Finally  with my colleagues in the House and Senate  we have worked hard to ensure that FEMA is responding to the needs of people in the Southern Tier  the Mohawk Valley   the Catskills  Central New York   and other upstate communities that have lost homes  businesses  and face other hardships as a result of severe flooding  It is imperative that the federal government provide the necessary resources to get people the help they need as quickly and efficiently as possible so that their homes  farms  businesses  hospitals  and other facilities can be repaired or rebuilt  and lives can go on  I have spoken with many local officials and people who have been directly impacted by the flooding  and have promised to do whatever is in my power to make sure no one is left behind  So many New Yorkers deserve our praise for their hard work and dedication in the immediate aftermath of these floods and for those who have been directly affected  my office and I will continue to be available to you in the difficult weeks and months ahead         Return to top   Investing in Education     In November of last year  I introduced the Investing for Tomorrow s Schools Act of 2005  Too many children are struggling to learn in overcrowded and deteriorating schools with leaking roofs  dangerously outdated ventilation systems  and other serious structural problems  Unless we invest in helping states and financially strapped school districts repair and modernize crumbling schools  these problems will only get worse and more expensive to fix  The act would provide immediate aid to the neediest schools and help fund affordable construction far into the future  New York has a greater need for repairs and renovation than any other state   estimated at  51 billion  In New York City alone  where schools on average are 61 years old  schools are estimated to need  21 billion in repairs  I will continue to fight for this legislation  every child deserves a safe and enriching place to realize his or her dreams and develop skills necessary to be competitive in the fast paced global economic climate           We also have to do more to stand with students seeking higher education  That is why I introduced the Non Traditional Student Success Act  a comprehensive bill to help students who are attending college while raising children and or working while studying   This legislation would make Pell Grants available year round  boost awareness and information about available financial aid  and provide financial aid to students who are attending school part time  In December of 2005  Congress passed legislation that included much of the act  fixing the definition of student costs so that students attending school less than half the time can receive financial aid to cover room and board for up to three semesters  simplifying access to need based aid  and reducing the  work penalty  by allowing working students to keep more of their earnings without penalizing their aid           The foundation of our financial aid system is the Pell Grant  Unfortunately  the buying power of the maximum Pell Grant has declined over time  In March  I cosponsored an amendment to increase the Pell Grant to  4 500           In addition  this spring I introduced the Student Borrower Bill of Rights  The legislation aims to provide student borrowers with basic  enforceable rights  the right to affordable loan payments that do not exceed a certain percentage of a student s income  the right to real options so that students can choose what is right for them  and the right to accurate information and transparency in the loan process         Return to top     Strengthening our Health Care System and Improving Public Health Preparedness     Another important challenge   which New Yorkers increasingly share with me   is the rising cost of health care  These last few months  in fact  I have held health care forums in Rochester   in Buffalo   and on Long Island to talk about health care  and how we can address the crisis  Forty six million Americans lack insurance  including 8 million children  Millions more are underinsured  We are all affected by our broken system  when hospital emergency rooms are filled  doctors struggle to meet increasing patient loads  and families face premiums rising five times faster than incomes           One important step we should take is to harness 21st century technology to improve quality  increase efficiency  and control costs  Technology has changed the way we do business   and it can change the way we administer and deliver health care  too  The Senate unanimously passed in November bipartisan legislation that I introduced with my colleague Senator Bill Frist and others to invest in health information technology  or health IT  The Wired for Health Care Quality Act would create a secure and private health IT infrastructure   to reduce errors  cut paperwork  lower costs  and improve patient care           Another step that would improve our system is making our health care system work better for small businesses  In March  I introduced legislation with a number of my colleagues to make it easier for small businesses to provide health care benefits for their employees  Small businesses are the engine of our economy  employing more than half of all private sector employees and driving economic growth  but these businesses struggle to offer health care to their employees  The Small Employer Health Benefits Program Act allows small business to join into one risk and purchasing pool   just like federal employees do   so businesses can negotiate for lower costs and offer a wider array of affordable choices to their employees           The Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee has also passed the Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act  legislation to create research centers to explore the links between environmental pollutants and breast cancer  This is an issue I care deeply about  and was proud to do my part as a member of the committee  Three million women in the United States are currently living with breast cancer  one million of whom have not yet been diagnosed  On average  over 13 000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed each year in New York State   with about 3 000 annual deaths caused by this disease           We also have to do more to prepare for public health threats  including the seasonal flu and the threat of avian or pandemic flu  Working across the aisle with my colleague  Senator Pat Roberts  I introduced legislation to fix the recurring shortages of flu vaccine and strengthen our vaccine delivery infrastructure  I have called on the Secretary of Health and Human Services  Michael O  Leavitt  to address the delivery issues and I have asked for an investigation into the communications gap with public health officials  providers  and the public about the flu vaccine supply  In October  the Senate adopted a proposal I co sponsored to increase funds to fight seasonal flu and help prepare our country for a pandemic or avian flu outbreak  In light of remaining concerns over shortages  I released a guide to help New Yorkers locate flu vaccine and have continued to urge the President and his allies in the Congress to support my legislation to improve our nation s vaccine delivery system         Return to top     Standing Up for Seniors     New York has the third largest population of older adults in the nation and as a member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  I have worked to address the challenges facing New York  s seniors  I will continue to fight for the promise of Social Security  and will stand against any ideological attempt to dismantle the program           As co chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer s Disease  I have been working to address the many challenges that confront Americans with the disease  as well as the challenges facing their families  Today  about 4 5 million Americans over the age of 65 are living with Alzheimer s  In New York alone  it is estimated that Alzheimer s directly impacts 330 000 people  Just a few weeks ago  I joined patients  caregivers  and advocates to raise awareness about the early onset form of the disease           I have also been working hard to fix problems in the new Medicare Prescription Drug Program  Medicare Part D  Throughout the enrollment process  my office offered a guide to seniors struggling with a difficult and often confusing new system of drug plans  In December  I introduced legislation to help the most vulnerable seniors and disabled Americans in their transition to the new plans  including those who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid and were automatically moved from Medicaid to Medicare as a result of the new law  As confusion over the program grew  I stepped up my efforts  urging the administration to aid local pharmacists and beneficiaries  such as those who reside in assisted living facilities  who bear the brunt of the problems with the new system  I traveled to pharmacies throughout New York to draw attention to real people who were affected by the changes and the confusion  and I continue to support fixes that will make the program work better for seniors           The Senate Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  of which I am a member  recently approved legislation that includes three of my initiatives that will serve New York seniors  These initiatives would foster greater access to home and community based long term care services so that seniors have greater autonomy and choice in meeting their needs  establish a national grant program so that communities with concentrations of older Americans  so called Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities or NORCs  can develop a service and support structure so more seniors can stay in the area  and address the gap in mental health services available to older Americans  who often suffer without treatment with conditions like depression and anxiety         Return to top     Promoting Energy Independence     As we have all seen these past months  energy prices pose a real challenge to our economy and to families working hard to make ends meet  I have called on the President to increase funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   especially after the price shocks that followed Hurricane Katrina  I helped to secure an investigation into price gouging to protect consumers in New York and around the country and called for legislation to protect consumers against gouging this summer as well  when many will spend time traveling on the roads           I am also working on long term solutions to meet the challenge of securing our energy future  I have proposed a series of steps to put America on the road to energy independence  to secure our economy  to safeguard our environment  and to free our hand to protect America and confront global threats  One proposal is to create a Strategic Energy Fund that will invest in new technologies  promote alternative fuels  such as biofuels  encourage conservation  and foster gains in efficiency  In the wake of historic oil company profits when many families have been struggling to afford even the daily commute  my legislation would finally ensure that these companies are part of the solution  The oil companies can either invest in alterative energy and efficiency  or invest in the fund   to help finally put us on a real path to energy independence         Return to top     Standing with our Armed Forces and Veterans     I also want to share with you what we have been able to achieve on behalf of our brave servicemen and women and our veterans  We owe a great deal to these patriotic individuals  I have met with many of these men and women  both in New York and in Iraq and Afghanistan   and they make me so proud to be a New Yorker and American  We cannot forget their sacrifice  New York contributes the fourth largest contingent of servicemen and women now in Iraq and Afghanistan           I have tried to honor their service in Congress   and am proud of what we have achieved on their behalf  My Heroes at Home Act  which will enhance support for troops transitioning back home after deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan   has passed the Senate  I am pleased to have introduced the amendment and proud to have received the support of the National Military Family Association and the Wounded Warrior Project  Heroes at Home will support returning men and women readjusting to work  struggling with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and other mental health issues  and confronting traumatic brain injuries  The measure also provides support and education to the family members of our returning troops  who often face their own set of challenges                     The second provision is a bipartisan amendment I introduced with Senator Lindsey Graham and others to improve retirement and TRICARE benefits for National Guard members and Reservists  Under the amendment  any Guard or Reserve member who is called or ordered to active duty or volunteers for active duty would qualify to receive retirement benefits earlier  In addition  the amendment further expands access to TRICARE  the health care available to our Guard and Reserve members  Improving health care for these men and women has long been a priority for me  In fact  last year  Senator Graham and I secured into law a provision that made all members of the Selected Reserve eligible to enroll in TRICARE  and created a separate category based on whether a Guard member or Reservist had been deployed  Reservists and National Guard members who volunteered to serve our country are playing an ever more demanding role as our nation faces new and grave threats  Our values demand that we honor these citizen soldiers with our best efforts to stand with them           The third provision would fix pay problems facing wounded soldiers  It is unconscionable that soldiers who have been injured in service to our country return home to bureaucratic mazes and problems receiving their pay  This amendment requires the Department of the Army to conduct an audit of its wounded soldiers  pay accounts and report back to Congress           I have also called on the army to investigate delays in providing improved body armor in response to reports that more extensive body armor for our troops in Iraq might have saved lives  I also called for a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee to investigate issues concerning body armor           In December  the Senate passed my bipartisan legislation to make available better financial education and training to members of the Armed Services  Too often  unscrupulous lenders and insurance providers seek to prey on our men and women in uniform  We need to give members of our armed services the financial knowledge they need to make informed decisions about how best to provide for their families  I am proud that the Senate has taken an important step forward in meeting this goal           We can look to other achievements as well  When the Pentagon announced their recommendations for base closures  for example  our state stood to lose several facilities and more than 1000 jobs  It was an uphill battle  but we stood together   and never gave up  A bipartisan coalition in Congress joined by local leaders and members of the community made a powerful case before the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission and fought hard to save New York s bases like the Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station and Rome s Defense Finance and Accounting Services facilities and prevent reductions at Rome s Air Force Research Laboratory and Stratton Air National Guard base  Now  instead of losing hundreds of jobs  New York is gaining hundreds  It was one of my proudest moments as a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee  having seen first hand on that committee the true value of top notch military facilities   That is what we have here in New York and it is heartening to learn that our leaders agree         Return to top     Standing up for Children and Families     For more than thirty years  I have been fighting for children   especially vulnerable children who  by no fault of their own  find themselves in difficult circumstances  I believe we all have a duty to these children  and I have worked hard to honor that duty in the United States Senate           In the past year  joining with grandparents from New York and across the country  we have underscored the challenges for families when children are raised by relatives other than parents  and I have called on Congress to pass my Kinship Caregiver Support Act           I have also tried to draw attention to the plight of young people  aging out  of the foster care system  often left on their own to further their education or obtain employment and housing with little or no family or community support structure           I cosponsored the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act to overhaul and strengthen our country s sex offender laws  The bill passed the Senate in May  I also co sponsored legislation renewing and strengthening the Violence Against Women Act  The bill passed the Senate last fall and became law last winter           In December  I joined with several colleagues to introduce a measure to protect children from graphic  violent  or pornographic video games  to strengthen the enforcement of video game ratings  and to put control back in the hands of parents  I am also pleased that my Children and Media Research Advancement Act  or CAMRA Act  passed a key committee in March  We ought to find out how the many kinds of media   including television  computer games  and the Internet   affect our children  and this bill will fund the research to do exactly that  On my website  http   clinton senate gov   I have published a Parent Media Guide to raise awareness about the resources and information available to parents looking to learn more about how to protect their kids in this new media environment           This past November  I was joined by Senator John E  Sununu to introduce the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act  named for a two year old Long Island boy who was killed when he wandered behind the SUV his father was backing into the driveway  Nearly every other day  a child dies in a non traffic vehicle accident  My bill will ensure that America  s cars are properly equipped with safety technology to prevent unintentional harm to our children so we can have safer cars and safer children in New York and across the country           A concern New Yorkers often share with me is the cost of housing throughout New York and the challenge of providing a good home for one s family  In April  I introduced the Federal Housing Fairness Act to increase the Federal Housing Administration  FHA  loan limits so that working families in high cost areas can use the program  The act raises the loan limit for single family homes to either the limit offered by Government Sponsored Enterprises like Fannie Mae or the median home price in the area           In June of this year  I built on the Federal Housing Fairness Act with new legislation  the 21st Century Housing Act  The act would reform and modernize the FHA  which has helped more than 34 million families realize the dream of home ownership  particularly helping first time homebuyers  low and moderate income homebuyers  and minority homebuyers  The FHA has long needed investment in personnel and technology infrastructure to remain competitive and useful to consumers  Reforming the FHA is important since it helps prevent many working families from having to seek out costly mortgages in the sub prime or predatory loan market           Last summer  I worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce the Housing America s Workforce Act  This legislation would provide incentives to increase private sector investment in housing with financial support for employees buying or renting a home and would make the benefit nontaxable so employees get the most out of employers  contributions           I am especially focused on tackling preventable environmental health issues that are affecting our children  particularly childhood lead poisoning  While we have made a great deal of progress  lead poisoning affects the health and development of more than 1 million children under the age of six nationwide  Despite a ban on lead paint in 1978  there are still over 24 million housing units in the United States that have lead paint hazards  about 1 2 million in New York State alone  We will never stop childhood lead poisoning unless we get lead out of the buildings in which children and families live  work  learn  and play  For this reason  I introduced the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act with Senators Mike DeWine  Barack Obama and Gordon Smith last year  which will provide an incentive for homeowners and landlords to safely remove lead based hazards  I joined Deputy Secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Agency Roy Bernardi and Dr  Benjamin Hooks in Rochester earlier this year to highlight efforts and model programs that will enable Monroe County to be lead free by 2010         Return to top                    I am proud of what we are achieving on behalf of New York   Indeed  looking back on all we have achieved these past twelve months  I am also reminded of how far we have come as a state these past five and a half years           We have faced incredible tragedy  September 11th changed our nation and touched personally and deeply the lives of thousands of New Yorkers   and we are still working to meet the challenges of new threats and dangers  We continue to confront challenges in our economy as we grapple with a more competitive global marketplace  We also face challenges to our values in what is a rapidly changing world  We have achieved a lot as well  working together for the great state of New York   Just a few weeks ago  for example  I joined the hardworking men and women of the Southern Tier at a defense plant in Owego   New York for the ribbon cutting at the facility that will build the next presidential helicopter  It was an incredible moment  years in the making  So many worked so hard to make it happen  and I was proud to do my part as the first New York Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee           Standing there among so many enthusiastic  smart  talented  hardworking New Yorkers  I was filled with optimism  knowing that on so many fronts there are no challenges to our security  our economy  or our values that we cannot meet by working together           Sincerely
