September 24  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Support of Stop Iran Now Rally                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     As thousands gather today in New York to decry the hateful and inciteful actions of the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  I am proud to join them by adding my voice to their efforts  As we know too well  the President of Iran has made a series of incendiary  outrageous comments  questioning the Holocaust and calling for Israel to be wiped off the map  Israel s right to exist  and exist in safety  must never be put in question  To deny the Holocaust places the President of Iran in company with the most despicable bigots and historical revisionists  These hateful statements are beyond the pale of international discourse and acceptability     His request to visit to Ground Zero  the site of the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil in our nation s history  a request that was properly denied was unacceptable as Iran continues to refuse to renounce and end its support of terrorism  President Ahmadinejad s outrageous comments and support for terrorism is even more disturbing when viewed in the context of the regime s quest to acquire nuclear weapons  his anti American  anti Israeli rhetoric underscores the seriousness of the threat  United States policy in this regard must be clear and unequivocal  We cannot and must not permit Iran to build or acquire nuclear weapons    We can and we must continue to speak up  I commend all of those raising their voices to raise awareness of the Iranian regime s policies and statements during President Ahmadinejad s visit  We must continue to work together to put pressure on Iran until it ends its anti American and anti Semitic policies of hate  ends its nuclear weapons program  renounces sponsorship of terrorism  supports Middle East peace  and plays a constructive role in stabilizing Iraq
