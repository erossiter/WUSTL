February 2  2007 Senator Clinton Calls on General Services Administration to Fully Fund Buffalo Courthouse Project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Clinton Calls  47 Million in President s Budget a Positive Step but Urges GSA to Fully Fund Project in Fiscal Year 2007 Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the General Services Administration  GSA  to fully fund the to fully fund the construction of the new federal courthouse proposed for downtown Buffalo with the  280 million that is set to be approved by Congress for Fiscal Year 2007    Following news yesterday from the federal Office of Management and Budget that  47 million would be included in the President s Fiscal Year 2008 Budget for the Buffalo Courthouse construction  Senator Clinton called the funding a positive step but urged GSA Administrator Lurita Alexis Doan to commit to fully funding the construction of the courthouse with the  280 million that is set to be approved by Congress for Fiscal Year 2007      For far too long  we have been fighting for these funds  Now that Congress is set to approve  280 million for 2007  I would hope that GSA uses that opportunity to fully fund the courthouse project as soon as possible   said Senator Clinton following the release of her letter   While I welcome the support in the next fiscal year s budget for this project  it is critical that the GSA fully fund this project in 2007  I will continue to fight to ensure its construction for the benefit of Buffalo s economy  its citizens and its criminal justice system      While the Senator was informed yesterday by officials with the Office of Management and Budget that the President s Fiscal Year 2008 budget will include  47 million for the construction of the courthouse  it remains unclear if the GSA will allocate sufficient funds for the Buffalo project in Fiscal Year 2007  It is estimated that to fully fund construction of the new courthouse   130 million in federal funds will be required   280 million for federal courthouse construction has already been included in the Congressional Fiscal Year 2007 continuing spending resolution  which passed the U S  House of Representatives and will soon be taken up by the U S  Senate  These funds are allocated to projects by the General Services Administration and should be sufficient to cover the Buffalo Courthouse construction     A full text of the Senator s letter to Administrator Doan is below      The Honorable Lurita Alexis Doan  Administrator  United States General Services Administration  1800 F Street  N W    Washington  D C  20405      Dear Ms  Doan        I learned yesterday that the President s FY 08 budget is likely to include  47 million for construction of the Buffalo  New York courthouse   While I welcome support in the budget for this important project  I am writing to urge you to commit full funding to the project in the current fiscal year     The Federal court is currently located in a building constructed in 1936 as part of a Public Works project and is sorely lacking in space and modern security measures  The new facility would alleviate the space shortages at the current facility by including new office space for judges and magistrates  the United States attorney and the United States Marshal s Service  In addition  the new building would provide grand jury space and prisoner holding cells  Centrally located in the downtown area  the courthouse will anchor the ongoing downtown revitalization effort    As you know  the FY 07 spending resolution  which passed the House and will soon pass the Senate  includes  280 million for federal courthouse construction   The resolution provides discretion to the General Services Administration  GSA  to decide how to allocate this money  which is far more than the  130 million needed to complete the Buffalo project   However  recent press reports indicate that GSA has not yet decided whether to fully fund the Buffalo project this year  and the inclusion of  47 million the FY 08 budget casts further doubt on GSA s plans   Buffalo has waited too long for this important project  and I urge you to provide full funding this year so that it can be completed as soon as possible        Sincerely yours        Hillary Rodham Clinton
