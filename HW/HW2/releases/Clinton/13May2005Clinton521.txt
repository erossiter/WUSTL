May 13  2005 Statement Of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding GE Dredge Study                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The study provision that General Electric inserted into a House appropriations bill should not be allowed to delay the Hudson cleanup  The fact is that this issue has been studied for more than a decade by the U S  Environmental Protection Agency  The EPA s conclusion was that removing PCB contaminated sediments from hot spots in the Hudson is the only way to eliminate the continuing health and environmental impacts caused by the estimated 1 3 million pounds of PCBs that GE released into the Hudson  The cleanup should go forward as planned  and I will be working with my Congressional colleagues to ensure that it does
