                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has joined with her colleagues on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe  calling on U S  State Department to support the formation of a 2007 Organization for Security and Co operation in Europe Conference  OSCE  on Anti Semitism and Intolerance           In a letter to U S  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  Commission members pointed out that similar conferences were held in 2003  2004 and 2005 and served as tangible examples of OSCE activity on anti Semitism and intolerance  In their letter  the Commission members called the Secretary Rice to pressure the OSCE to formally endorse the 2007 conference before the Brussels Ministerial in early December  They also expressed their support for a distinct anti Semitism portfolio within the OSCE and for the OSCE  s continuing engagement in combating anti Semitism            It is imperative that the OSCE commits to the Bucharest Conference as a continuation of their action against anti Semitism in Europe and around the world  Such a conference and the continuation of the OSCE  s commitment to fighting anti Semitism will help ensure that this kind of oppression and fear will not go unchallenged     Senator Clinton said    I  along with the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe  urge Secretary Rice to take early action to secure OSCE endorsement of the Bucharest Conference in 2007 in order that the OSCE can continue its fight against such dehumanizing acts           A copy of the letter is attached       September 11  2006    The Honorable Condoleezza Rice   Secretary of State  Department of State  Washington  DC 20520      Dear Secretary Rice        We write today to underscore the importance of continued U S  leadership in support of sustained OSCE engagement in combating the unique scourge of anti Semitism as well as other forms of intolerance already addressed in Helsinki commitments  Members of the U S  Helsinki Commission have been at the forefront of efforts to fight the rise of anti Semitic violence that swept through Western Europe beginning in 2002  Working through the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and with support of the White House and State Department  we have successfully moved the OSCE to begin to tackle the perpetual evil of anti Semitism in real and concrete ways           A tangible example of OSCE activity on anti Semitic and intolerance has been the series of high level conferences held in Vienna  June 2003   Berlin  April 2004   Brussels  September 2004   and Cordoba  June 2005   Notably  the Ljubljana Ministerial Council also agreed last year to   consider the possibility of an OSCE conference in 2007    to promote tolerance and non discrimination  which Romania has offered to host                      We urge the Department to take early action to secure  in time for the Brussels Ministerial in early December  formal OSCE endorsement of the Bucharest conference  The 2007 meeting should be a high level conference modeled on the Cordoba format  We feel certain the host country and the incoming Spanish Chair in Office will be pressured to remove any specific mention of anti Semitism in the title or session topics  It is essential that the Bucharest conference preserve the unique focus and attention that anti Semitism deserves  as was done in Cordoba  so the issue is not blurred with other pernicious  but distinct  concerns                       Another area of related OSCE activity was the appointment of Personal Representatives of the chair in Office on specific manifestation of intolerance  Recent OSCE chairs reappointed three experts to serve as their Personal Representatives on Combating Anti Semitism  German MP Gert Weisskirchen   on Combating Intolerance and Discrimination against Muslims  Turkish Ambassador   mur Orhun   and on Combating Racism  Xenophobia and Discrimination  including Discrimination against Christians and Members of Other Religions  Irish Professor Anastasia Crickley            We fully support the distinct anti Semitism portfolio  as well as the others  as useful tools in the fight against intolerance that must be maintained  Additionally  the OSCE should be encouraged to further enhance its institutional capacity to monitor these issues permanently                               During C    rdoba last year  in anticipation of Spain  s 2007 OSCE chairmanship  Spanish Foreign Minister Moratinos gave his strong personal commitment to maintaining a distinct focus on anti Semitism within the OSCE  We would point out Spanish leadership and initiative resulted in the C    rdoba conference  and that Spain has indicated an initial willingness to reappoint the three Personal representatives  We respectfully urge you to work together with him and other like minded minister to ensure sustained OSCE engagement in combating anti Semitism                       Madam Secretary  we appreciate your personal commitment to this issue  We look forward to working with you and your colleagues at the Department to ensure the topic of anti Semitism remains high on the OSCE agenda in the lead up to the Brussels Ministerial and beyond          Sincerely     Sam Brownback  U S S    Chairman    Christopher H  Smith  M C    Co Chairman    Gordon H  Smith  U S S                                                             Commissioner    Benjamin L  Cardin  M C    Ranking Member    Hillary Rodham Clinton  U S S    Commissioner    Frank R  Wolf  M C    Commissioner
