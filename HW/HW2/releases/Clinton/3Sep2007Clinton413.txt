September 3  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Release of Haleh Esfandiari                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I welcome the news that Haleh Esfandiari  director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars  has been allowed to leave Iran  Dr  Esfandiari has been prevented from leaving Iran since last December  and endured more than three months of unjust imprisonment  Her courage and fortitude during this time is admirable    While Dr  Esfandiari s release is a positive development  I am disappointed that three other Iranian Americans are still being held against their will by the Iranian government  Dr  Kian Tajbakhsh  a development consultant  and Ali Shakeri  founder and board member of the Center for Citizen Peacebuilding  are arbitrarily imprisoned  while journalist Parnaz Azima is unable to leave the country  The continued detention of these three individuals remains an unconscionable violation of their human rights    I call upon the Iranian government to continue the progress signified by Dr  Esfandiari s release  and immediately release the three Iranian Americans who remain unable to return to their homes and families  I will continue my efforts with my colleagues in Congress to press for their freedom
