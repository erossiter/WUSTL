August 4  2006 Clinton Backs Call to Label All Hazards in Pesticides                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senator Will Introduce Legislation to Close Pesticide Labeling Loophole                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is backing a call for the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to mandate the disclosure of all hazardous ingredients in pesticides  Earlier this week  fourteen states made a formal request to the EPA to change their labeling standards to require pesticide manufacturers to disclose all hazardous chemical ingredients in pesticides  In a letter to EPA Administrator Johnson  Senator Clinton pointed out that while manufacturers are required to list all active ingredients  they are not required to list inert ingredients  many of which have been identified as being hazardous   Senator Clinton asked the EPA to grant the states   request to change the pesticide labeling rules  and announced that she will introduce legislation to require disclosure of all hazardous ingredients on pesticide labels              It is unacceptable that we have a loophole in federal law that exempts suspected carcinogens and other hazardous chemicals from being listed on pesticide labels  and I will be introducing legislation to close that loophole   I am also calling on the EPA to act on this problem immediately by granting the petition filed by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and others earlier this week     said Senator Clinton           A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter is attached          August 3  2006      The Honorable Stephen L  Johnson  Administrator  United States Environmental Protection Agency  Ariel Rios Building   1101A  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20460      Dear Mr  Johnson       I write in support of the petition relating to pesticide labeling under the Federal Insecticide and Fungicide Registration Act  FIFRA  filed this week with the United States Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Attorneys General from 13 other states            Under FIFRA  EPA has developed rules governing the labeling of pesticides   These rules require that pesticide manufacturers include   active    ingredients by name on pesticide labels  but do not require   inert    chemicals to be listed on labels   However  the distinction between an   active    and   inactive    ingredient relates only to the function that the ingredient performs in the pesticide  not to its toxicity            EPA has demonstrated some concern about the hazards posed by inert chemicals   The EPA requires eight specific chemicals to be listed on pesticide labels when they are included as inert ingredients because of toxicity concerns   Yet  according to the petition filed this week  there are nearly 360 other chemicals that have been identified as being hazardous under other federal environmental protection or occupational safety laws   Incredibly  there are 14 chemicals that EPA requires to be listed on a label when they are active pesticide ingredients  but not when these same chemicals are inert ingredients            These are very disturbing findings   Inert ingredients often make up the bulk of the contents of a pesticide    sometimes 99 percent or more   Some of these chemicals are suspected carcinogens  and others are linked to adverse effects on fetal development and other health problems            We need to better protect those who use pesticides  and I urge you to take immediate action to require listing on pesticide labels any hazardous inert ingredients   In addition  I will be introducing legislation to close the FIFRA loophole and require the listing of hazardous inert chemicals on pesticide labels            Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
