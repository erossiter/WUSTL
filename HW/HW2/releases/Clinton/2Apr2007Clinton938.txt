April 2  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the Bankruptcy of New Century Financial                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton issued the following statement on the Chapter 11 bankruptcy announcement of New Century Financial  the nation s largest  independent subprime mortgage lender             Today s bankruptcy announcement by New Century Financial  one of the nation s largest mortgage lenders  is a stark example of the risk posed to our economy from the crisis in the subprime mortgage market   But to be sure  more than Wall Street s bottom line is threatened by these developments   The financial well being of millions of homeowners throughout the country is at risk as the rates on many of these risky mortgages begin to rise in the coming year   It is clear that prompt action is needed to rein in the questionable lending practices that have led to this crisis and to help homeowners at risk of foreclosure          I have called on the federal regulators to adopt rules that ensure greater oversight of the subprime mortgage industry and to put an end to the most abusive and deceptive lending practices   Moreover  I have called on the regulators to put clear and strong consumer protections in place so that borrowers know what they are getting when they put their name on the dotted line   A lax regulatory environment may have contributed to the conditions that have led to today s subprime troubles   It is critical that we reinforce the federal regulator s role as the enforcement watchdogs over mortgage lenders           Senator Clinton recently announced an initiative to address the crisis in the subprime market  including increasing independent and face to face financial counseling for borrowers before they take out mortgages and for homeowners at risk of foreclosure  limiting the length of time for which prepayments apply and prohibiting prepayment penalties on mortgages with rates above a certain level  strengthening the Truth in Lending Act and existing federal regulations to ensure that there is plain talk  no fine print disclosure  and a possible  foreclosure timeout  to create incentives for lenders to identify troubled mortgages and work out solutions with borrowers to avoid foreclosure   Senator Clinton has also introduced legislation to strengthen and modernize the Federal Housing Administration s mortgage insurance program  expanding access to a stable and responsible alternative to the subprime market   Last week Senator Clinton also wrote to Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke regarding proposed regulations on subprime mortgage lenders             The text of Senator Clinton s letter follows          The Honorable Ben S  Bernanke  Chairman  Federal Reserve Board  20th Street and Constitution Avenues  N  W   Washington  D C  20551      RE  Docket No  OP 1278  ATTN  Jennifer J  Johnson  Secretary  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System      Dear Mr  Chairman       Earlier this month the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council  FFIEC  offered proposed guidance that would ostensibly provide stricter guidelines for subprime lending   I applaud the FFIEC for taking this step and I welcome the opportunity to comment   It is clear that prompt action is needed to protect borrowers  and to ensure that lower and moderate income families continue to have access to home ownership             The recent housing statistics are worrying  delinquencies are up  foreclosures are up  home prices are down  and home sales are down too   To make matters worse  the rates on more than a million subprime adjustable rate mortgages are escalating this year  and another 800 000 will escalate next year   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation acknowledged to the Senate Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that the current problems may only be the tip of the iceberg   The problems in the subprime market are affecting millions of Americans and now threaten to harm our economy   Defaults and foreclosures in one segment of the mortgage market could drive lenders to tighten credit standards across the board   This would make it harder for first time homebuyers to obtain mortgages  and it would exacerbate weakness in the housing market   All of this bodes poorly for consumer spending  and ultimately  for the economy   The situation is grave  and we must act            I recently announced an initiative to address the crisis in the subprime mortgage market   I proposed that independent and face to face financial counseling be made available to borrowers before they take out mortgages  and to homeowners at risk of foreclosure   Second  I proposed limiting the length of time for which prepayment penalties apply  and prohibiting prepayment penalties on mortgages with rates above a certain level   Third  I proposed strengthening the Truth in Lending Act and existing federal regulations to ensure that there is plain talk  no fine print disclosure   Too often lenders are not upfront about what is lurking in the details   Fourth  I called for  foreclosure timeout    We need to create incentives for lenders to identify troubled mortgages and to work out solutions with borrowers to avoid foreclosure   Finally  I have reintroduced the 21st Century Housing Act to strengthen the Federal Housing Administration s  FHA  mortgage insurance program   FHA loans should be available to more Americans   These loans are a responsible and stable alternative to the subprime market              The federal regulators have proposed strengthening underwriting standards  curtailing the issuance of reduced documentation loans  and requiring clearer disclosure of loan terms   I support the broad objectives of the proposed guidance   Going forward  we also need to ensure that the regulations cover non bank and non traditional lenders who originate a significant portion of the riskiest subprime mortgages   We must also ensure that the appropriate regulators have the ability to effectively enforce these rules as well    Home ownership is the greatest source of wealth accumulation for average Americans  and all responsible families should have an opportunity to participate   We should take greater steps to ensure that regulators not only have the authority but the responsibility to end the deceptive and irresponsible lending practices that drew people into adjustable rate mortgages and other hybrid loans they could not afford when the rates adjusted upwards            The problems in the subprime lending market have been gathering for years   I fear that regulatory oversight has been lax and too many lenders were irresponsible or unscrupulous  Families and communities are now paying the price   I urge the regulators to take prompt and careful action to ensure that the abuses of the last few years do not recur           Thank you for your attention to these issues           Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
