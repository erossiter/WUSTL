June 7  2007 Senator Clinton Questions Lieutenant General Douglas Lute at Senate Armed Services Committee Confirmation Hearing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Senator Clinton  Thank you Mr  Chairman  And General  thank you  Thank you for your years of service to our country and I agree with my friend and colleague  Senator Reed  I dont know why you would put yourself in this position  but I am grateful that you saw that this was a way to continue your service and I wish you well in a position that many of us believe is an impossible one  We can only hope that perhaps you might be listened to where others have been ignored for some years now  General  one of my concerns is that there is growing pressure here in the Congress  and it certainly is reflected around the country   that at some point in the not very distant future we will begin to withdraw our combat troops when it becomes abundantly clear  as I believe it already is  that the Iraqis are not yet done with killing each other  They have no intention to reach a political resolution and there is no one in the Iraqi government nor on the scene who appears able to emerge to try to force those political settlements that are absolutely essential to any kind of stability or security in Iraq  We may  as I have said  have remaining missions that will be concerned with Al Qaeda with the difficult position that we find ourselves in vis  vis the Kurds  the Turks  and the increasing pressure on the Kurds from the Sunnis to the south  As well as  perhaps  a continuing training and logistical role if the Iraqis get their act together  as well as protecting our interests and attempting to figure out what to do about Iran going forward  But I do not foresee a long term role for our combat brigades in the midst of this sectarian civil war     So  to that end  since we know it will be difficult  time consuming  and dangerous to withdraw our troops and our equipment  I wrote to Secretary of Defense Gates on May 23  and gave a copy of my letter to General Pace asking for briefings on what exactly the planning was with respect to future  maybe even imminent  withdrawals of US forces from Iraq  And Mr  Chairman  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Secretary Gates be entered into the record   Chairman  It will be made part of the record  Senator Clinton  Because certainly  while sitting on this committee  both in public and in private encounters and conversations  it has disturbed me that there seems to have been only the most general of contingency planning with respect to withdrawal  and I believe that withdrawal will be extraordinarily dangerous for our troops  There are basically two ways out  up through the north  assuming the Turks let us come out  And they didnt let us come in  so thats a challenge  Perhaps they will see there interest differently  Or through the south  along highways that will be very difficult to control and protect  And we know that a great number of our causalities and injuries occur because of the IEDs and now the more powerful explosives that attack our convoys     So General Lute  I hope that among your many responsibilities that you have assumed that you will look at this  And may I ask you  if you will please turn your attention to this issue  determine what level of planning has taken place  whether the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs have been briefed about the level of planning  what kind of timeline would exist if a decision for either military or political reasons were taken to begin withdrawal  and that you would assume this to be part of your responsibility in your new position   Lt  General Douglas Lute  Thank you Senator  I do think such an adaptation  if the conditions on the ground call for it  will be part of this position   Senator Clinton  Thank you very much General  I think that among the many concerns that we have expressed to you are the confusion over responsibilities and chain of command  In fact  I think that has been an unfortunate hallmark of this administrations policy toward Iraq from the very beginning  It was unclear who was in charge after the invasion  It certainly was opaque  at best  as to the extent of authority exercised by Mr  Bremer  There has been a tremendous amount of difficulty and lack of accountability up and down the chain of command because there have been so many detours and other actors that have been involved and I think that one of your challenges will be trying to sort all that out  It is certainly my opinion that the Vice Presidents office has played a major role  continues to play a major role  and runs a parallel operation  What is your understanding of your responsibilities vis  vis the Vice President   Lt  General Lute  Senator  as Ive said  I will work directly for the President but of course the Vice President is on the policy council  if you will  the principals committee of the National Security Consul  And as such  is an important participant in policy development considerations  So  as I work with the President to set the agenda for that council I will be working with the Vice President and his staff   Senator Clinton  Well  I wish you well because that certainly  thats turned out to be a difficult situation for many  I dont know quite how we ever really determine what the chain of command inside the White House is  but certainly I think its important that whatever your advice is be given directly to the President on a regular basis  And it would be my very strong recommendation  if you havent already negotiated that  that you certainly try to obtain that assurance that you will be working with and directly reporting to the President     Finally  the question that Senator Bayh raised about Turkey  I think is increasingly critical  During the past few weeks there has been an increase in tension between Turkey and the Kurds with the Turks bitterly complaining about continuing Kurdish separatists attacks  I dont know that weve had a very good briefing on that Mr  Chairman  I cant figure out what is and isnt really happening  We know that there is a great deal of enmity between these forces  Im told by the Kurds that theyve tried to put a stop to the separatist actions  I dont know whether thats true  so I think its important that we try to sort it out  Turkey is a very important ally of ours and I know that given some of the internal discontent and political upheaval going on in Turkey that there is tremendous nationalist pressure on the Turkish military to respond to these attacks     Its been reported that there was  last Sunday  an ambush and killing of eight Turkish military personnel inside  Turkey   Yesterday  there were unconfirmed reports that some Turkish military units crossed over the border to conduct raids and limited clearing operations in suspected militant camp locations  I just urge General  that you pay immediate attention to this  I know that General Ralston was appointed as a presidential envoy some time ago to the Turkish government  I think this demands the highest and most urgent attention     Clearly  it is not in anyones interest that the Turks cross the border in mass  and the Kurds need to understand that it is not in their interest  but I would not be surprised to discover that there were agents  provocateurs  within the Kurdish area  either operating outside of the two principal Kurdish lines of military command or in some back room deal involved with a few people in Kurdistan that needs to be reined in  if possible  This situation is dangerous and difficult enough  We certainly dont need to see it explode in the north  General  I too will be supporting you because of my high regard for you and what I know of your record  For those who  like Senator Reed  who are incredibly admiring of your service  which I share  and I hope that you  since you are being confirmed by the Senate  will see it as part of your continuing responsibility to keep the Congress apprised of what is happening with your work   Lt  General Lute  Thank you
