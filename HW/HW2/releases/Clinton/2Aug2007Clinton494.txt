August 2  2007 Clinton  Kerry   Boxer Introduce Legislation Requiring Pentagon to Prepare for Iraq Redeployment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  During a press conference this afternoon on Capitol Hill  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   John Kerry  D MA  and Barbara Boxer  D CA  introduced legislation that would require the Pentagon to prepare a report and briefing for Congress on contingency planning for redeploying troops from Iraq      A transcript of Senator Clintons remarks is below             Senator Kerry and I and our co sponsors for this legislation are here today because we believe strongly in the vital role that Congress has played throughout our history in holding administrations accountable and protecting our nation and our military s future through rigorous debate and oversight    Our system of checks and balances is a source of strength  and it ensures that our policies are tested by the fires of the democratic process    That is why on May 22  2007  I wrote to Secretary of Defense Gates  requesting that he provide the appropriate oversight committees in Congress with briefings on contingency plans for the future of our troops in Iraq    I did so out of a sense of seriousness and concern because the seeds of many problems that continue to plague our troops and the mission in Iraq were planted in the failure to plan for the conflict and properly equip our men and women in uniform    And Secretary Gates had previously said that planning had been limited to more of just broader conceptual thinking   In fact  General Pace had reiterated that the Joint Chiefs of Staff had not received orders to prepare contingency plans    Instead of the kind of partnership that we should have between the executive and the congressional branch  the Bush administration offered a political  unacceptable response through Undersecretary Edelman  a reply that suggested congressional oversight emboldens our enemies and public debate over Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda    It was a letter that impugned the patriotism of millions of Americans  including a bipartisan majority in the United States Senate who believe it is long past time to change course in Iraq    I appreciate that Secretary Gates followed up with a different letter that expressed regret this important discussion went astray and reaffirmed his support for congressional oversight    In fact  as a result of my inquiry  a classified Pentagon briefing regarding planning took place this morning before the Senate Armed Services Committee  and I welcomed that briefing    Whatever the contingency might be  it is clear that planning is essential  and not just planning in broad strokes  but very specific plans that take into account all the various and often difficult contingencies and circumstances that we will face    Withdrawing troops from Iraq will be dangerous and difficult  And we must oversee the Bush administration  as the Constitution demands  and that four years of mistakes and mismanagement in Iraq require    That is why we are introducing this legislation  Senators Kerry  Boxer  Lautenberg  Bayh  Brown and Whitehouse    to mandate that the Pentagon brief Congress on contingency planning to ensure the safe and secure redeployment of our troops from Iraq    This goes way beyond politics and certainly beyond partisanship  The American people have said  consistently  it is time to change course in Iraq   We don t believe it is possible to wake up one morning and order a change of course   We think you have to be preparing  even if it is painful to do so    And after four years of miscalculations and misjudgments  the need for oversight could not be clearer    So I appreciate my colleagues joining me   And we will continue to do whatever we can to make sure that we protect our young men and women in uniform  that we protect as many lives of Americans and Iraqis as possible    We must not redeploy out of Iraq with the same combination of arrogance and incompetence with which the Bush administration exhibited deploying into Iraq   We did not have a smart plan to go in  but we will do everything in our power to be sure we have a smart plan to get out    Read more about Senator Clinton s call for redeployment planning  Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the war in Iraq
