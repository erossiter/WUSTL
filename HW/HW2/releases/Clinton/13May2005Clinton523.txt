May 13  2005 Senator Clinton Announces  51 Million Authorization For Defense Projects To Benefit Southern Tier                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Funding included in Department of Defense Authorization Bill approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the Senate Armed Services Committee has authorized  51 million in defense funding for projects that will benefit the Southern Tier  including  39 million for Schweizer Aircraft  s RQ 8B Fire Scout Vertical Takeoff and Landing Unmanned Air Vehicle  VTUAV  program   2 million for SUNY Binghamton  s Small Scale Packaging System and  10 million for Rockwell Collins   GATM for the KC 135 program        The Committee also authorized the President  s budget request of  935 9 million for Lockheed Martin Owego  s VXX Marine One Program  At a recent hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton spoke out in support of full funding for the VXX Marine One program and called for the project to move forward   expeditiously           The news came as the Senate Armed Services Committee  of which Senator Clinton is a member  approved the FY 2006 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill  The bill now goes to the Senate for approval          The Southern Tier has been reinvigorated through its efforts to support and encourage local businesses exploring new horizons in technology and manufacturing  These investments are another important step in maximizing the new high tech potential of the region     Senator Clinton said    These companies are not only supporting our troops but supporting the local economy and I am pleased to work with them as we strengthen the Southern Tier  s high tech future           Schweizer Aircraft   RQ 8B Fire Scout VTUAV   39 Million  A funding increase of  39 million for the Fire Scout unmanned helicopter was authorized in this year  s bill  The Fire Scout VTUAV  s primary role will be to provide Navy and Marine personnel with information about combat situations and precision targeting on the sea and ashore  The Fire Scout s long endurance  excellent performance  sophisticated payloads  ability to take off and land vertically  and autonomous operating capability make it uniquely able to provide long range surveillance and targeting under the most demanding of tactical conditions    The Fire Scout s dynamic system is derived Schweizer s Model 333 turbine helicopter  which has been proven by over 20 million flight hours  With vehicle endurance greater than six hours  Fire Scout is capable of extended continuous operations  The Fire Scout will be able to fly 110 nautical miles from launch site  stay aloft for three hours  and then return   Lockheed Martin Owego   VXX    Marine One Program  President  s Budget   935 9 Million   Today  s security environment requires urgent upgrades to the presidential fleets security and defensive systems   The current VH 3D presidential helicopter fleet has been in service for thirty plus years and is now at the end of its useful life  and also has insufficient payload capacity that will not allow the installation of additional communication and defensive equipment  In late January 2005  the U S  Navy selected Lockheed Martin to build the new Marine One helicopter fleet   This program partners with numerous small and medium sized American companies statewide that creates and sustains thousands of jobs   The US101    VXX helicopter is technologically advanced with integrated avionics  navigation  communications  updated security systems and capable of operation in all weather conditions   It will provide an oval office in the sky with a larger cabin and low vibration to allow the President and the traveling staff to work in transit   The President will be transported in a proven  safe  secure  state of the art helicopter built to military specifications        SUNY Binghamton    Small Scale Packaging System   2 Million  Small scale systems  devices and interconnects on the order of micro to nanometers in size  are critical to national security   While there has been considerable interest in emerging technologies as in micro electromechanical systems  MEMS  and nanostructured materials and interconnects  the emphasis has been focused mainly on devices and components rather than systems   This limitation stems from the inherent challenges of constructing small scale systems  Scores of miniaturized components as varied as interconnect systems  carriers  power sources  memory  data transmission and land based or wireless reception at the systems level create taxing complexities  Meeting these and other critical packaging challenges in the development of small scale systems will be necessary to actualize the promise of nanoscale science and engineering through the creation of next generation weapons systems   The Small Scale Systems Packaging Center at Binghamton University will use this funding to develop materials and technologies for next generation weapon systems   specifically to fund personnel conducting small scale research  acquire equipment  equip laboratories  initiate workforce development initiatives  and facilitate technology transfer and job creation        Rockwell Collins    GATM for the KC 135   10 Million  The Air Force has embarked on a program referred to as Global Air Traffic Management  GATM  to equip its applicable aircraft with a capability to comply with the new mandated FAA regulations   Aircraft that do not possess these new capabilities will be denied access to airspace where such capabilities are mandated  or be severely restricted in such areas   Restrictions may include outright denial of access to selected airspace  or assignment of limited and inefficient flight altitudes  or assignment of inefficient routes of flight  and extensive flight authorization delays        Rockwell Collins  located in Binghamton  NY  will work with the Air Force  s premier GATM program in equipping its existing fleet of KC 135 air refueling tankers with the capabilities required by these new regulations   Aircraft equipped with the required systems will have the operational advantage of choosing the most efficient and economical routes of flight  as well as continued access to airspace that is now regularly used in DOD world wide operations   While operational access to airspace has been important to address the  far flung  military commitments of the 1990  s  it has now reached a critical status as the Government continues to fight the War on Terror   It is imperative that the United States is capable of projecting airpower to any location via the most direct route   This is fundamental to having combat crews reach the target area with the most fuel and in the least fatigued condition possible
