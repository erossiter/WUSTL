April 25  2006 Clinton Calls On Veterans   Affairs Secretary To Listen To New York  s Veterans Before Finalizing Cares Recommendations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC     Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on Veterans   Affairs Secretary R  James Nicholson to not make any decisions regarding the closure or realignment of VA hospitals in New York State before completing the local advisory panel process which includes invaluable input from local veterans             Before you make any decision regarding the closure or realignment of VA hospitals  I urge you to complete the local advisory panel process prior to making a recommendation   The local advisory panel process is designed to insure that the input of veterans is taken into account before making decisions that could directly affect the health care needs of thousands of veterans in New York and around the nation     Senator Clinton wrote in a letter to the Secretary           Senator Clinton  s letter to Secretary Nicholson  came on the heels of a news report that a Department of Veterans Affairs official had stated that the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  initiative was coming to a close with an announcement expected in the coming weeks              I have repeatedly emphasized how absolutely essential it is that during this phase in the process  the VA  s planning process for the Canandaigua  Montrose  Castle Point  Manhattan and Brooklyn VA  s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York  s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process     Senator Clinton wrote            Senator Clinton has fought for New York s veterans throughout the CARES process  She has repeatedly called on and met with former VA Secretary Anthony Principi as well as current VA Secretary Nicholson to reiterate her serious concerns regarding the VA CARES initiative and the process by which the VA decided to make changes and study yet more changes in New York s VA facilities           Throughout her time in the Senate  Senator Clinton has been working hard to protect the interests of New York s veterans    to provide full funding for veterans  health care  to make mandatory the funding of VA health care and to keep New York VA hospitals open          A copy of the Senator  s letter to Secretary Nicholson follows            April 25  2006         The Honorable R  James Nicholson  Secretary  United States Department of Veterans Affairs  810 Vermont Avenue  N W   Washington  D C  20420      Dear Mr  Secretary          I write with great concern regarding recent comments reported in the Federal Times   The article quotes a Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  official who says about the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  initiative    We  ve come to the end of the process  and we expect to be making announcements in the next couple of months              Before you make any decision regarding the closure or realignment of VA hospitals  I urge you to complete the local advisory panel process prior to making a recommendation   The local advisory panel process is designed to insure that the input of veterans is taken into account before making decisions that could directly affect the health care needs of thousands of veterans in New York and around the nation            In addition to soliciting the input of veterans who are currently using VA facilities  it is essential that you fully consider the needs of returning veterans   Faulty VA projections regarding the number of service members returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom was reportedly one of the reasons the VA had to make enormous revisions in its health care budget projections last year   It is essential that the returning veterans of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom   many of whom have suffered serious injury and will need lifelong care   be accurately considered in VA  s projections            Each VA Hospital brings critical capabilities that must be fully considered and integrated into a solution   As I have explained on numerous occasions  I have serious concerns regarding the process by which the VA decided to make changes in New York facilities   I have repeatedly emphasized how absolutely essential it is that during this phase in the process  the VA  s planning process for the Canandaigua  Montrose  Castle Point  Manhattan and Brooklyn VA  s be fully transparent  and how critical it is that New York  s veterans be given a full and fair opportunity to make their voices heard in the process             At this time in our nation  s history  with United States troops bravely serving in Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  it sends exactly the wrong message to propose drastic changes in veterans   health care without proper thought and deliberation   Our troops are fighting overseas to defend our values and way of life   We owe it to our current and future veterans to make sure that we provide the best health care possible for them and that we do not implement recommendations that provide our veterans with less than adequate health care          I look forward to working with you on behalf of the veterans of New York and on behalf of the veterans around this nation who are depending on us to keep the commitment our nation has made to them          Sincerely yours          Hillary Rodham Clinton
