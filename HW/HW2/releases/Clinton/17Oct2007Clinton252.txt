October 17  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Release of Pandemic Influenza  Warning  Children at Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I am pleased to see that Trust for Americas Health and the American Academy of Pediatrics have released this report highlighting the needs of pediatric populations during a pandemic influenza epidemic  As our public health system works to prepare for both a potential pandemic and seasonal influenza  we must ensure that our efforts to protect our health extend to children as well  Our government recognizes the importance of vaccinating children against seasonal flu  but more must be done  This report highlights the ways in which our experiences with seasonal flu vaccination can impact our efforts to vaccinate children during a pandemic  The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices  ACIP  recommends vaccination for all children from six months to four years of age  children who have chronic diseases like asthma  and school aged children who wish to reduce the risk of becoming ill with influenza  However  influenza vaccination rates among these populations is low  with less than one out of five children receiving the recommended vaccinations  Clearly  we must do more to improve awareness of the importance of flu vaccination among pediatric populations during our annual flu season  This report also highlights some of the challenges in pandemic preparation  Much of our preparation has been focused on stockpiling antiviral medications and facemasks  In the past few years  antiviral medications have been approved for use in some  but not all  pediatric subgroups  However  we have not made such advances with masks and respirators  many of which are not designed to fit the smaller faces of children  We must ensure that pediatric formulations of medications and devices are widely available during a pandemic  I will soon be reintroducing legislation with Senator Roberts  the Influenza Vaccine Security Act  that will address some of the issues in the report  in addition to helping our overall national response to seasonal influenza  This bill will improve the ability of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide outreach to priority populations  such as young children  and improve vaccination rates among those most at risk of complications from influenza  It will also require the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that pediatric products are adequately represented in the Strategic National Stockpile  and encourage the Secretary to work with the private sector to develop treatments and devices to help protect children during a flu pandemic  With these provisions  we will be taking steps to prevent transmission of both seasonal and pandemic influenza among the tens of millions of children in our country  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to raise awareness of the public health needs in both seasonal and pandemic influenza for children  families  and all Americans
