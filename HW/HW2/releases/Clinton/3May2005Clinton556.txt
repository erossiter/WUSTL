                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that the City of Syracuse will participate in a major statewide urban initiative to plant more than 100 000 new trees across New York over the next five years        As part of the first phase of the plan  Senator Clinton announced that the city will be receiving between  5 000    10 000 in grant funding from American Forests and Coleman Natural Foods for the purchase and planting of trees  The second phase will provide the city with a share of 100 000 trees funded by American Forests and Coleman Natural Foods  The 100 000 new trees will be planted across Syracuse  Buffalo  Binghamton  Poughkeepsie  and Rochester        The donation  which was secured through a unique public private partnership with the conservation group American Forests and Coleman Natural Foods  forms part of Senator Clinton s Urban Forestry Initiative  a major statewide greening campaign which she launched last year  Since the launch of the initiative  Senator Clinton and American Forests have been working with all five cities to support urban forestry campaigns including cost sharing partnerships with local businesses and other innovative urban greening projects         Problems like ozone pollution and smog continue to pose serious health problems for New Yorkers and trees are the perfect remedy  But more than that  planting trees in urban areas is also an important step in making our cities better places to live   said Senator Clinton   This donation will help our cities become cleaner and greener  This is a tremendous investment in our cities and our future          We are very pleased and excited about the City of Syracuse s partnership with Senator Clinton s  Greening of New York  initiative because it contributes so much to the environment  economic vitality and quality of life here in Syracuse   said Syracuse Mayor Matthew J  Driscoll   Last year  in partnership with Cornell Cooperative Extension of Onondaga County and the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry  SUNY ESF  we planted hundreds of new trees downtown and on Syracuse Housing Authority property including 50  Tidal Basin  cherry trees at Kirk Park  We plan on expanding our effort this year and look to SUNY ESF s strong and effective support to determine the feasibility of restoring a major urban forest on the east slope of Syracuse s Onondaga Hill         In welcoming the announcement  State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry President  Dr  Cornelius B  Murphy  Jr  said   SUNY ESF s continued participation with Senator Clinton s  Greening of New York  initiative is a  natural  for the College  For us at SUNY ESF  everyday is Arbor Day  We recently planted eight transgenic American Elm tree bio engineered by SUNY ESF scientists to be resistant to Dutch Elm disease  This is a major first step toward restoring these magnificent Heritage Trees to our American urban forests  Later this summer  we will be planting 500 more on college property in the City of Syracuse for a major United States Department of Agriculture field trial  At the same time  we remain totally committed to our partnership with Mayor Driscoll and planting hundreds more trees in the City of Syracuse this fall using the volunteer efforts of our SUNY ESF students         Deborah Gangloff  Executive Director of American Forests  noted that the GAO recently released its report on reforestation needs for America s forests  The report concluded that America s forests are in critical need of restoration   Senator Clinton s far sighted initiative to bring trees to New York and to enlist the support of companies like Coleman Natural Foods is a model of the kind of public private initiative that can make the difference  American Forests is proud to be the tree planting partner for this effort         Mel Coleman  President of Coleman Natural Foods said   As a 5th generation rancher I have seen first hand how important conservation and stewardship is to the future of agriculture and food production  I am proud to be a partner with American Forests and Senator Clinton in restoring trees and forests to New York          Coleman s 10 year  Eco Project 2015  will include the company s commitment to plant 100 000 new trees in New York and one million new trees across the country  By challenging their partners and customers to join the  Eco Project 2015   Coleman aims to plant a total of 20 million new trees throughout the United States        Last May
