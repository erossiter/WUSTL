August 3  2006 Clinton  Higgins Spearhead Efforts to Include New York Schools and Farmers in National Fresh School Snack Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                New York Congressional Delegation Calls on Senate and House Appropriations Committees to expand the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable School Snack Program to New York State      Program would provide new funding to schools to allow them to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables from local farmers and to provide them as healthy snacks for kids during the school day                                         Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congressman Brian Higgins today announced that they had convened a bipartisan coalition of New York s Congressional Delegation calling for New York State to be included in a national healthy school food program           The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program  FFVSP  provides federal funding to schools to allow them to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables from local farmers and to provide them as healthy snacks for kids during the school day  Currently there are 14 states participating in the program           In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate and House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittees  the Members of Congress called on them to include New York State in the program and incorporate an additional  1 million in funding for the program in the upcoming Fiscal Year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations Bill               New York has been waiting for years to get the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program implemented in our state   our kids shouldn t have to wait any longer     Senator Clinton said     New York State is an innovator in grassroots farm to school programs and schools throughout our state have shown great initiative when it comes to incorporating fresh  locally grown fruits and vegetables into their school meal programs   Inclusion in this program will not only bring more nutritious snacks to New York s school children  it will also help build institutional markets for our family farmers              The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program will provide New York s kids with nutritious snacks that have previously been unavailable to them   Our kids deserve the quality this program offers in their lives  helping them become healthier at a young age   This program will also provide a new market for our farmers  many of whom are Western New Yorkers  which will strengthen our state and region s agricultural economy   Congressman Higgins said          The FFVSP  which would improve children s health and encourage healthy eating habits  would be especially effective in New York State where  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  28 percent of New York high school students are overweight or obese  often leading to chronic health problems  The FFVSP would also help strengthen New York State s agricultural economy   New York is a leading producer of specialty crops  ranking 2nd nationally in apple production  3rd in grape production  4th in pear production and 6th in fresh vegetable production   New York farmers are eager to develop new institutional markets  and the FFVSP will help them to do so           A copy of the letter is attached          2 August 2006      The Honorable Robert F  Bennett  Chairman                             Subcommittee on Agriculture  Rural Development and Related Agencies  Senate Committee on Appropriations  188 Dirksen Senate Office Building  Washington  D C  20510      The Honorable Herb Kohl  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Agriculture  Rural Development and Related Agencies  Senate Committee on Appropriations  123 Hart Senate Office Building  Washington  D C  20510      The Honorable Henry Bonilla                      Chairman                        Subcommittee on Agriculture  Rural Development  FDA  and Related Agencies  House Committee on Appropriations  2458 Rayburn House Office Building      The Honorable Rosa DeLauro  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Agriculture  Rural Development  FDA and Related Agencies  House Committee on Appropriations  2262 Rayburn House Office Building      Dear Chairman Bennett  Chairman Bonilla  Ranking Member Kohl and Ranking Member DeLauro       We are writing to urge you to expand the USDA Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program  FFVSP  to include New York State at a funding level of  1 million for fiscal year 2007          As you know  the FFVSP was originally initiated as a four state pilot program in the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act   Because it was such a success  Congress converted the pilot to a full program in the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization of 2004 and expanded funding to include four additional states   With your support  the program was expanded again to add six additional states last year  through the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill             Currently  the House has requested a  25 million funding level for FFVSP in the fiscal year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill  H R  5384  with a recommendation that the program be expanded to all 50 states at  500 000 per state   The Senate bill includes language supporting the program s expansion to three additional states at a funding level of  1 million per state  totaling  18 million   While New York was not included as one of the three new pilot states in the Senate version of the bill  it deserves serious consideration to receive funding for the FFVSP because of the great size and need of the student population and the importance of New York s agriculture sector to its economy   Our hope is that the funding level for the FFVSP will be expanded beyond the Senate requested level and that funding in the amount of  1 million will be added to extend the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable School Snack Program to New York State          The FFVSP is important for improving the health of our nation s children and it would be especially effective in New York State   It is a well established fact that obesity and related illnesses have risen dramatically among children in the United States in recent years   In fact  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  28 percent of New York high school students and 58 percent of New York adults are overweight or obese          The USDA Dietary Guidelines released last year recommend an increase in the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables that studies have shown are important for a healthy diet  for cancer prevention  and for decreasing the risk of other chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease  diabetes  and hypertension   Access to fresh fruits and vegetables in schools will not only improve the nutrition of children  but will also establish healthy eating habits that children can take home to their families and that will benefit them for the rest of their life             New York State is an innovator of grassroots farm to school programs  but it needs assistance in expanding these efforts   New York schools have shown great initiative to incorporate fresh  locally grown fruit and vegetables into their meal programs   For example  the New York City Office of School Food  which serves meals to more than 1 2 million children every day  has been successful in introducing locally grown New York apple slices into its school meals programs  but it can do so only on a limited basis   The apples have been extremely well received by the kids and there is a large desire to implement programs like it in more schools across the state  if funding were made available          In addition  FFVSP would help strengthen New York State s agricultural economy   New York is a leading producer of specialty crops  ranking 2nd nationally in apple production  3rd in grape production  4th in pear production and 6th in fresh vegetable production   Our farmers are eager to develop new institutional markets  and programs like FFVSP will allow them to do so   This will undoubtedly benefit New York State  which produces over  3 billion in agriculture products annually          We appreciate your consideration of this request and your shared desire to reduce childhood obesity and start kids on a path to wellness   As you work towards Senate passage and a conference report on the two versions of the Agriculture Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2007  we encourage you to support additional funding in the amount of  1 million to extend the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable School Snack Program to include New York State   We look forward to working with you                                                   Sincerely          Hillary Rodham Clinton  Brian M  Higgins  Charles E  Schumer
