December 19  2005 Schumer  Clinton and Rep  Tim Bishop Urge Energy Secretary to Restore Full Funding for Brookhaven National Lab Project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Call for Meeting with Secretary Bodman to Discuss Need for Vital Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Washington  DC   With Brookhaven National Lab on Long Island  New York  threatened by significant cuts to a major scientific program  New York Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton  and Congressman Tim Bishop have written to Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman to urge him to restore funding to BNL s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC    They have also called for a meeting with Secretary Bodman to discuss the critical need for this funding                RHIC is a vital  world class nuclear physics facility used by over 1 000 users and more than 200 students at the undergraduate  masters  and doctoral levels   RHIC provides the resources for breakthrough science  and we are concerned that the funding shortfall will paralyze the momentum of Brookhaven Lab   Over  1 billion has been invested to date in Brookhaven on this project   We must not allow for any further disinvestment of federal spending in such a national treasure   the members of Congress wrote in their letter            Their letter to Secretary Bodman follows their meeting last week with the Energy Department s chief science officer  Dr  Raymond Orbach  to request a reprogramming of  20 million in funding from within the Office of Science budget for RHIC operations in FY 2006   Dr  Orbach agreed with the members of Congress that the RHIC is an integral part of the country s scientific infrastructure and shared his support for ongoing initiatives at Brookhaven   However  the Science Director was unable to provide assurance that any funding was available within the science portion of the Energy Department budget   The members are urging Secretary Bodman to find funding within his  24 billion budget to restore the  20 million that is necessary to pay for the RHIC s operation for FY 2006           The following is the text of their letter to Secretary Bodman           The Honorable Samuel Bodman  Secretary  United States Department of Energy  1000 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C   20585          Dear Mr  Secretary           We write concerning an issue of grave importance facing Brookhaven National Laboratory located on Long Island  New York   As you know  the Department of Energy s FY 2006 budget request to Congress resulted in a negative impact upon operating time for the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  at Brookhaven    The Nuclear Physics program does not have sufficient resources to operate RHIC  and that will compromise our nation s competitive edge             We worked to make sure that the Senate provided  419 7 million for nuclear physics  an increase of  49 million over the President s budget   Additionally  the House of Representatives provided  408 3 million for nuclear physics  an increase of  37 6 million above the President s budget with specific language to restore operating time for the RHIC   Unfortunately  additional funding did not remain in the final FY 2006 Energy   Water Appropriations bill   Consequently  this funding level means the amount available in fiscal year 2006 will reduce RHIC operations from 31 weeks to only 5 6 weeks            RHIC is a vital  world class nuclear physics facility used by over 1 000 users and more than 200 students at the undergraduate  masters  and doctoral levels   RHIC provides the resources for breakthrough science  and we are concerned that the funding shortfall will paralyze the momentum of Brookhaven Lab   Over  1 billion has been invested to date in Brookhaven on this project   We must not allow for any further disinvestment of federal spending in such a national treasure            We met with the Director of the Office of Science  Dr  Orbach  to request a reprogramming of  20 million in funding from within the Office of Science budget for RHIC operations in FY 2006 and were informed that such a reallocation is not possible   We now request your assistance in reprogramming funds from within the overall Department of Energy appropriation for the current fiscal year   In addition  we request that you grant Brookhaven National Lab whatever authority it needs to reprogram funds for RHIC operations   Furthermore  we would like to request a meeting with you to discuss this important matter   We are dedicated to ensuring Brookhaven s lasting viability in the future and we stand ready to do whatever we can to ensure Brookhaven s future is one of growth             Sincerely      Hillary Rodham Clinton                                        United States Senate                     Charles E  Schumer  United States Senate          Tim Bishop  United States House of Representatives
