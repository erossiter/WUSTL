                 Washington  DC   Senators Chris Dodd  D CT  and Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today hailed House passage of their amendment  The Support for Injured Servicemembers Act  which if signed into law will allow the families of wounded military personnel to take up to six months of unpaid leave   The Dodd Clinton amendment expands the benefits provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act  FMLA   which currently allows for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave annually   The measure  approved today as part of the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  bill  will implement a key recommendation of the Dole Shalala Commission on the Care for Wounded Warriors      The Dodd Clinton amendment has received widespread  bipartisan support in both the Senate and the House   The Senate cosponsors of the bipartisan amendment include Senators Elizabeth Dole  R NC   Lindsey Graham  R SC   Barbara Mikulski  D MD   Saxby Chambliss  R GA   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Ben Cardin  D MD   Robert

amendment is also supported by the National Partnership for Women and Families  the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America  the National Military Families Association  the Military Officers Association of America  the National Guard Association of the United States  the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States  and the Reserve Officers Association    Congress should have no greater priority than ensuring the safety and well being of our nations troops  said Dodd  The Family and Medical Leave Act has provided job protection to more than 50 million Americans and I am pleased to see Congress working to ensure FMLA is expanded for those caring for our nations military heroes  No one should ever be forced to choose between the job they need and the family they love  especially those serving our country  The fact is  military families face unusually difficult demands  such as caring for a loved one with traumatic brain injury  and it is essential that FMLA be expanded to accommodate those special needs  The brave men and women who serve our country deserve nothing less than the assurance that when they return home their family members will be able to care for them without fear of losing their jobs     The families caring for wounded servicemembers are facing extraordinary circumstances and it is our duty to make sure they have the care and support they need   Extending Family and Medical Leave to six months will have a significant and immediate impact for families who have sacrificed so much on our behalf  said Senator Clinton   I am proud that the House has approved our measure and agreed that we should implement this critical recommendation of the Dole Shalala Commission   I hope that we can take quick action on this bill in the Senate and that the President will do the right thing for our servicemembers and their families and sign this bill into law          Senator Dodd is the author of the landmark Family and Medical Leave Act  FMLA   which has allowed more than 50 million workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave if they are ill or if they need to care for a sick family member or new child  Dodd recently introduced the Family Leave Insurance Act of 2007  legislation that will provide paid leave to workers for the birth or adoption of a child  to care for a child  spouse or parent with a serious illness or to care for their own serious illness  Senator Dodd has been a long time advocate for the health and safety of U S  troops  From leading the effort to ensure that our men and women in uniform have the safety equipment they need  to fighting to restore National Guard readiness  Dodd has worked tirelessly on behalf of American servicemen and women     Senator Clinton has been a champion of the Family and Medical Leave Act  which has helped more than 50 million Americans since President Clinton signed it into law in 1993  Senator Clinton has worked to build on this landmark law  cosponsoring the Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act and the Healthy Families Act  She has also introduced legislation to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to flight attendants and pilots  As New York s first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform and their families have the healthcare and support they need  most recently securing a series of measures in the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act approved unanimously by the Senate
