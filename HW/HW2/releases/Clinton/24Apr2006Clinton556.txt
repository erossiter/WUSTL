April 24  2006 Senator Clinton Calls For Funding To Ensure Healthy Schools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Today is National Healthy Schools Day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton marked National Healthy Schools Day by emphasizing that too many children in New York and around the country are struggling to learn in deteriorating schools   Senator Clinton called on the Appropriations Committee to fund Healthy  High Performance Schools  a program Senator Clinton was instrumental in helping to create in the No Child Left Behind Act               A quality school environment is essential to the academic success of children in America  s schools but too many children in New York and around the country are struggling to learn in crumbling schools and unhealthy environmental conditions   Creating the Healthy  High Performance Schools program was important step toward giving our communities the help they need to ensure our children can learn in a safe and healthy school environment  but we need funding to do the job     said Senator Clinton          According to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics  3 5 million children attend schools that are in very poor or non operational conditions   In addition  America  s schools need more than  127 billion to meet the renovation and construction to make them a healthy place to learn and work   New York faces a significant need to upgrade and modernize its schools   New York was recently ranked ninth among the nation  s top ten worst states for environmental problems and facility inadequacy            A recent study by the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University found that students learning in substandard classrooms have test scores that are five to 17 percentage points lower than those of their peers attending school in better buildings   Yet  almost half of all U S  schoolchildren are attending schools with at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition   In New York  76 percent of schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor            During crafting of the No Child Left Behind Act  Senator Clinton worked tirelessly to include the Healthy  High Performance Schools program   Under this program  local educational agencies can receive grants to fund school building and renovation projects   The Healthy  High Performing Schools program was also designed to provide funds for states to create and disseminate information and technical assistance to the neediest local schools  helping them to improve the indoor air quality and energy efficiency of their buildings   The implementation of Healthy  High Performance Schools will help the U S  Department of Education contribute to the substantive on going federal research on child environmental health           To aid school districts in efforts to improve school conditions  Senator Clinton also joined with Senator Tom Harkin  IA  to introduce legislation help rebuild America  s crumbling schools   The Investing for Tomorrow  s Schools Act would enable states to develop State Infrastructure Banks to provide a flexible  inexpensive source of funding for school construction and renovation   State Infrastructure Banks would offer school districts a flexible menu of loan and credit enhancement assistance  such as low interest loans  bond financing security  loan guarantees  and credit support for financing projects  which result in lower interest rates              Passage of this bill would lay the groundwork for a robust system that would provide immediate aid to the neediest schools and help fund affordable construction far into the future   This modest proposal is an important piece of the healthy schools solution     Senator Clinton remarked             A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee urging funding for the Healthy  High Performance Schools program follows            Dear Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Harkin          I write to urge you to provide  25 million in the fiscal year 2007 budget for the Healthy and High Performance Schools program   I am very concerned that the President  s budget request consistently denies funding for this vital program despite the growing body of evidence clearing illustrating that school environments can be unhealthy places for children           An increasing number of studies are demonstrating healthy building environments contribute to lower absenteeism that is so and are critical to children  s capacity to learn   Despite this fact  almost one quarter  28 000  of our nation  s schools have inadequate heating  ventilation and air conditioning systems  and 21 000 have faulty roofs            Ignoring the health of school buildings can have serious ramifications   A recent study by the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University found that students learning in substandard classrooms have test scores that are five to 17 percentage points lower than those of their peers attending school in better buildings   If we are going to hold schools accountable for students  performance on tests  then we simply cannot allow our lowest performing students to start out five to 17 points behind solely because of the unhealthy environment in which they are taught            The Healthy  High Performance Schools  HHPS  program would provide the crucial funds for states to create and disseminate information and technical assistance to the neediest local schools   This data will  in turn  help states to improve the indoor air quality  energy efficiency and overall health of their school buildings   HHPS implementation will also help the U S  Department of Education contribute to the substantive  on going federal research on child environmental health             It is absolutely essential that we help our students and our local schools compete and produce healthy adults  by engaging in supporting better facility design and environmental management  and by encouraging cutting edge facilitating needed federal research on child learning   The Healthy and High Performance Schools program does both           I hope that you will make Healthy and High Performance Schools a priority during the budget process this year and urge you to provide  25 million in the budget for provide adequate for the Healthy  High Performance Schools Program in fiscal year 2007            Sincerely        Hillary Rodham Clinton
