September 10  2007 Senators Clinton and Smith Applaud Unanimous Senate Approval of Resolution to Support Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC  Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Gordon H  Smith  R OR  today applauded unanimous Senate approval of a Senate resolution they introduced earlier this year designating November as Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month  The resolution will bring attention to the need for increased research funding  early detection methods  and treatment  as well as public education about pancreatic cancer      Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month will bring much needed attention to a disease that is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States   I am pleased my colleagues have unanimously approved this resolution  as it is critically important to educate communities in New York and across the country about early detection methods and treatment programs for this deadly disease  said Senator Clinton      Like many cancers  early detection is key to survival and recovery  said Senator Smith   Pancreatic cancer  however  is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths because it is seldom detected in its early stages   My mother  Jessica Udall Smith  is among the thousands who suffered and ultimately lost her battle with pancreatic cancer   The goal of this resolution is to support increased research funding  early detection methods  and effective treatments and programs to help put an end to high fatality rates from this destructive disease    The leadership Senators Clinton and Smith are providing for this initiative is critical in raising support for pancreatic cancer  says Julie Fleshman  President  CEO of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network  Our hope is that through this continued legislative support  pancreatic cancer will begin to develop the kind of funding  early detection  and treatment progress we need to increase the survival rate to parallel the range of other cancers    The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2007  over 2 300 New Yorkers and 37 170 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer  and more than 33 000 Americans will die from this disease   The resolution passed today highlights the difficulty in detecting and treating pancreatic cancer  as there has been no significant improvement in survival rates over the last 25 years   Seventy five percent of pancreatic cancer patients die within the first year of diagnosis due to a lack of early detection tests   Furthermore  the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer is 40 to 50 percent higher in African Americans than in other ethnic groups
