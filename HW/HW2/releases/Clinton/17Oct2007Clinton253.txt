October 17  2007 Senator Clinton Holds Oversight Hearing on Federal Superfund Program s Activities to Protect Public Health                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Chair of the United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health  held a hearing today to examine the federal Superfund programs capacity to protect public health  including the reasons for recent slowdowns in the pace at which sites are added and cleaned up toxic waste sites under the program   Cleanups under the Superfund program have slowed from an average of 80 per year during the late 1990s to less than 40 per year over the last six years   In addition  EPA has identified more than 100 sites where human exposure to contamination is uncontrolled  including seven in New York     Senator Clinton has pressed the EPA to address and accelerate cleanup of contaminated sites across New York   As part of these efforts  she has introduced legislation to require the EPA to set tougher standards to protect the public from exposure to the carcinogenic chemical Trichloroethylene  TCE   one of the most widespread industrial water contaminants in the nation  found at many sites across New York   She also has advocated once again holding polluters accountable for cleanup by reinstating a fee on oil and chemical companies that previously provided funding for the now bankrupt Superfund Trust Fund    The following is a transcript of Senator Clintons opening remarks at todays hearing   SENATOR CLINTON   The Superfund program is such an important part of our environmental protection system in our country and I think this is a very significant opportunity to discuss what it is doing and what more it could do     Superfund has its roots in New York  stemming from the discovery in 1978 by Niagara Falls resident Lois Gibbs that her neighborhood known as Love Canal had been built on a massive chemical dump  The effects of that chemical dump had been seen but not understood for years and the impact on the people who live there was tragic  Love Canal became a national story and helped spur Congress to enact the Superfund law  which was signed by President Carter in December of 1980     The Love Canal site was finally taken off of the Superfunds national prioritys list in 2004  but 1 246 sites across the country remain on Superfund list today including 86 in New York alone  So as we approach this 30 year anniversary of Love Canal  the Superfund site remains vitally important  because it reminds of us of why we went down this path and the importance is underscored by a report issued last year by the Center for American Progress and the Center for Progressive Reform  That report profiled fifty of the most dangerous sites still on the Superfund list and scattered across ten states     We will hear more about that report later in the hearing but I want to highlight a couple of its findings  First  most of the fifty sites are located in heavily populated areas  Second  many have been on the list for decades  Third  they contain a range of highly toxic chemicals such as PCBs  creosote  lead  arsenic  mercury  and TCE     Sixty percent are located in neighborhoods where households reported median incomes in the range of  40 000  and some 26 percent were in the midst of populations comprised of 40 percent or more of racial or ethnic minorities  So  this is both an environmental health issue and an environmental justice issue  Thats why I am dismayed by the Bush Administrations handling of this program    The number of cleanups has fallen dramatically from the average of about 75 sites per year from 1993 to 2000 to an average of fewer than 40 sites per year under this administration    In Fiscal Year 2007  only 24 cleanups were completed  When weve asked the administration to explain this sharp drop in cleanups  they claim it is due to greater complexity of the sites left to be cleaned  I dont accept that point  but even if you take it at face value  it raises another important question  Why wont the administration therefore ask for more money to get the program back on track to deal with the allegedly more complex sites     When asked that question  the administration has tied itself into knots defending the absurd position that more money would not help all that much  And they have been extremely secretive about this project  keeping information from the public  and stonewalling this committee     Chairman Boxer submitted a series of questions and I am delighted that she is here because she submitted those questions to the EPA about Superfund five months ago  On Monday    two days before this oversight hearing    she received a stack of documents in response  All but three of the documents were marked privileged    That is just simply unacceptable  What does the administration have to hide  I thought we were all in this together     I hope we can get beyond this pattern today  The administration can keep repeating mission accomplished  but the Superfund program does not square up with reality     There are 11 superfund sites where human exposure to dangerous levels of toxic chemicals is not under control  There are 111 of those sites  because seven of them are in New York alone  In addition  EPA indicates that there are 160 other sites where EPA has insufficient information to determine whether human exposure to these toxic chemicals is under control     I will be pressing EPA today to explain their plans to get these sites under control and explore the reasons for the slow down in cleanups  I think its clear that this program needs additional funding  I think reinstating the polluter pays fee is a step we must take  both to provide additional funds for the cleanups and to make to make the program fairer     Ordinary taxpayers should not pay for cleanups and thats what has been happening at orphan sites for the last four years  So we have a lot of ground to cover today and I want to turn now to Ranking Member Senator Barrasso
