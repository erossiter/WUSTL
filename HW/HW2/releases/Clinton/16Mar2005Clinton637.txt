March 16  2005 Senator Clinton Outraged by Defeat  of First Responders Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton expressed outrage about the first responders amendment that was defeated by Senate Republicans yesterday  Senator Clinton joined Senator Debbie Stabenow  MI  in co sponsoring this amendment to the budget resolution that would restore the shortsighted cuts in funding to critical first responder and law enforcement programs          These programs provide the necessary resources for the men and women in the public safety community who put their lives on the line everyday and they should not be shortchanged   Senator Clinton said   We simply asked the Republican leadership to set aside 2  of their tax cut agenda so we could adequately fund the firefighters  police  and first responders who patrol our streets  answer our 911 calls and guard our borders and ports against terrorists  The defeat of this amendment is another clear example of the misplaced priorities in this budget         Specifically  the Amendment would have restored  1 6 billion in cuts included in the Republican Budget Resolution including  226 million for firefighter assistance grants   298 million to the State Homeland Security grant program   79 million to the Urban Area Security Initiative   486 million for the COPS program and  537 million for the Byrne Justice Assistance grants  Not only does this amendment provide the needed resources for the public safety community  it was fiscally responsible by completely offsetting the cost of this funding by closing abusive corporate tax loopholes and reducing the budget deficit
