December 19  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Response to the President s Remarks Today on The Patriot Act                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I support extending the Patriot Act  but it must strike the proper balance between securing our safety and ensuring our freedom and must be changed to protect places like New York that face the greatest threat and risk   If President Bush is truly concerned about New York  he should stop letting his Republican Congressional colleagues use these funds for pork barrel projects  and instead allocate them on the basis of real threat and risk
