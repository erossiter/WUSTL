January 5  2006 Senator Clinton Fights For Threat Based Funding For the Buffalo Niagara Region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton sent a letter to the Erie County Executive and Niagara County Manager to reiterate her commitment to assist them and to make sure Secretary Chertoff and the Department of Homeland Security understand and appreciate the unique homeland security threats that the Buffalo Niagara region faces when they make their UASI grant determinations this year and in the future          A copy of Senator Clinton  s letter to Erie County Executive Joel Giambra   Niagara County Manager Greg Lewis follows          Dear County Executive Giambra and County Manager Lewis          As I explained recently  I applaud the Department of Homeland Security  s  DHS  announcement that it will focus more keenly on risk in its decisions on how to distribute Urban Areas Security Initiative  UASI  grants   As you know  I have long advocated for a homeland security funding plan that recognizes that our nation  s high threat cities need and deserve more funds if we are going to faithfully discharge our duty to protect our citizens   However  despite what appears to be a positive step by DHS  I am troubled by Secretary Chertoff  s announcement that the Buffalo Niagara region could possibly be excluded from future UASI funding           The Secretary  s initial assessment suggests to me that he does not appreciate that the Buffalo Niagara region is uniquely at risk and that the region  s vulnerabilities require federal assistance to ensure its safety   As we all know  one of Buffalo Niagara  s greatest assets  its proximity to Canada  also makes the region uniquely vulnerable   Buffalo alone is home to four international bridges    the Peace Bridge  the Rainbow Bridge  the Queenston Lewiston Bridge and the Whirlpool Bridge    each of which must be secured   The Buffalo Niagara region also plays host to the nation  s highest concentration of hydroelectric power  providing an important power source that helps supply electricity to major portions of the Eastern United States   We cannot permit this important energy source to be compromised   And lest we be accused of overstating the region  s vulnerabilities  we need only remind the Secretary that the   Lackawanna Six    terrorist cell had its origins in the Buffalo Niagara region          I share your concern that our limited homeland security funds get to where they are needed most   We must ensure that populations facing the greatest threat    like the Buffalo Niagara region    receive the funding needed to protect the community   I will do whatever I can to impress upon Secretary Chertoff the unique threats that face Buffalo Niagara when DHS makes their UASI grant determinations this year and in the future  and I am committed to continuing to work with you on this important effort          Sincerely yours          Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton
