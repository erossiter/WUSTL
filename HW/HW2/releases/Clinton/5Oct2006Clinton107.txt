October 5  2006 Clinton Introduces Comprehensive Rural Broadband Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that she has introduced   The Rural Broadband Initiative Act of 2006     The legislation creates a policy and action framework to ensure that the federal government employs an effective and comprehensive strategy to deploy broadband service and access in the rural areas of the United States           Many rural areas of New York and other states across the country still don  t have access to broadband   It is critical that the 25 percent of Americans who live in the rural areas of the United States are not left behind in this increasingly information and technology driven economy     Senator Clinton said     We need to do more to increase access to broadband   The United States currently ranks 16th in the world in broadband deployment and rural communities simply can  t continue to wait until rural broadband development becomes as economically viable as it is in our cities and suburbs   The Rural Broadband Initiative Act recognizes the special economic needs of rural communities and ensures that the government plays a helpful role in furthering economic development by increasing broadband connectivity in rural areas           First outlined in a major speech given in Upstate New York that highlighted needed efforts for rural communities  Senator Clinton  s bill would establish an Office of Rural Broadband Initiatives at the Department of Agriculture and create an Undersecretary for Rural Broadband to be charged with coordinating several rural broadband grant and loan programs aimed at encouraging broadband infrastructure investment in underserved rural areas   Among the programs that would fall under the new Office  s jurisdiction is the Rural Broadband Access and Loan Guarantee program  which has been criticized for being too cumbersome and having qualification criteria too stringent to benefit the small  innovative telecommunications companies willing to invest in rural areas   This bill would require the Undersecretary to streamline and improve the program to ensure that loans and grants are being made to telecommunications companies with sound business plans   Moreover  the Undersecretary would be charged with developing a comprehensive rural broadband strategy to facilitate broadband access in rural areas as quickly as possible       Also  the bill would establish a Rural Broadband Innovation Fund that would invest in experimental and cutting edge applications that can deliver broadband service to rural areas including satellite  fiber  WiFi  and broadband over power lines  BPL   Finally the bill would establish a Rural Broadband Advisory Panel that would include members of both the public and private sector to discuss issues relating to broadband deployment and offer advice and guidance to the Undersecretary in developing a comprehensive rural broadband strategy        Broadband deployment has traditionally lagged in rural areas due to geography  population and lack of a viable market for large telecommunications companies   The Government Accountability Office has indicated that while about 30  of households in urban and suburban areas have access to broadband  only 17  of rural households have access          The legislation builds on Senator Clinton  s longstanding commitment to fostering broadband access in rural areas   She  along with Congressman John McHugh  NY 23   has urged the Rural Utilities Service Administrator to make improvements to the Rural Broadband Access and Loan Guarantee Program that has been slow in processing loans to companies willing to invest in broadband infrastructure in rural areas  They also urged that the RUS address the program  s rigid qualification criteria which are too strict to allow small  upstart telecom companies from participating in the program        In addition to urging greater private investment in rural broadband deployment  Senator Clinton has cosponsored legislation that would provide telecom companies that build and invest in broadband networks in rural  underserved areas tax incentives to encourage more investments  This Congress  she has cosponsored S  1147  a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the expensing of broadband Internet access expenditures  and for other purposes  sponsored by Senator John D  Rockefeller  D WV   which allows companies that build broadband networks in rural areas to deduct the costs of their investment
