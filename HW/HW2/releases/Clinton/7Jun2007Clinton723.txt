June 7  2007 Clinton Joins Bipartisan Push to Secure Benefits for Fallen First Responders                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Members of Congress Concerned that Critical Survivors  Benefit Program is being Mismanaged with Many Claims Languishing or being Denied   Members Call on President Bush to Expedite Outstanding Claims Under the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act                                                                                                                                                  Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined a bipartisan and bicameral push to secure rightful benefits for fallen first responders   In a letter to President Bush  Senator Clinton joined Members of Congress in raising serious concerns about the slow implementation of the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act and the large number of claims for benefits under the Act that have been denied or are tied up in review for unjustifiably extended periods of time   It has been more than three years since the passage of the Act  and more than 8 months since the Department of Justice finalized its rule on the laws implementation  yet over 80 percent of the claims still languish and 46 have been denied    It is unconscionable that the families of first responders are getting anything less than this Administrations full support on this critical issue   Our first responders must be ready to react at the first sign of trouble and live under constant stress   These men and women put their lives on the line every day and when their lives are lost  they and their families pay the ultimate price for bravery  Congress approved this program to help those who have lost their loved ones in the line of duty and it is a serious cause for concern that this Administration appears to be delaying or denying them compensation   The Administration must give the families of these fallen heroes their rightful benefits under the law and in line with the intention of Congress  Senator Clinton said     The Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act was passed unanimously in both Houses of Congress three years ago  correcting a provision in the Public Safety Officer Benefit Program that made it very difficult to file claims and receive benefits for officers who had died of a heart attack or stroke   Hometown Heroes Survivor Benefits Act expanded the Public Safety Officers Benefit  PSOB  program to cover public safety officers who die of heart attacks or strokes in the line of duty  The legislation was motivated by the fact that these first responders are under an inordinate amount of stress every day and are more vulnerable to heart attack and stroke   These sentiments were confirmed by a recent Harvard study that reported that firefighters are up to 100 times more likely to die as the result of a heart attack or stroke than the general public      A copy of the letter to President Bush is below     June 7  2007   The Honorable George W  Bush  President  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC 20502   Dear Mr  President    We write to express our collective concern about the Department of Justices  DOJ  administration of the Public Safety Officers Benefit  PSOB  program  particularly with its slow implementation of the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act  PL 108 182    With the DOJ having denied 46 claims and made only six positive Hometown Heroes determinations out of nearly 260 claims it has received  we believe it has misinterpreted the intent of Congress in enacting the law by forcing families to deal with unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles to prove their claims    Hometown Heroes  which passed unanimously in both Houses of Congress three years ago  reflects the intention of Congress to provide presumptive benefit to the families of public safety officers who die from heart attack or stroke in the line of duty unless there is strong evidence to the contrary     I f a public safety officer dies as the direct and proximate result of a heart attack or stroke  the officer shall be presumed to have died as a direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty    The legislation was motivated by the fact that police  firefighters  and other public safety officers put themselves at risk every day  including the risks that their stressful and strenuous activity will result in a heart attack or stroke   This is confirmed by the results of a recent Harvard study  which shows that firefighters are up to 100 times more likely than the general public to die of a heart attack or stroke   These men and women  who serve our country and community so valiantly  deserve no less than our full support in ensuring their families are cared for when they make the ultimate sacrifice    In 2004  then Attorney General Ashcroft mandated that all PSOB claims should be processed in no more than 90 days   Unfortunately  more than three years since the passage of the Hometown Heroes law  and more than eight months since DOJ finalized its rule on the laws implementation over 80 percent of these claims still languish   The Department of Justice appears to be giving them less than its full support with its delays and denials   We are disappointed that this situation remains unresolved   The families of our nations first responders have waited too long    Therefore  we call on your administration to afford the families of public safety officers who die from heart attacks or strokes within the parameters set forth in the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefit Act their rightful benefits under the law by expediting all of the outstanding claims and ensuring that benefits are awarded in line with the intention of Congress    Thank you in advance for your consideration of these requests   We look forward to your prompt response    Sincerely
