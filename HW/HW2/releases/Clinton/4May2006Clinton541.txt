                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Clinton  Hagel resolution calls on President Bush to declare lung cancer a national public health priority                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed unanimous Senate approval late last night of Senate Resolution 408  which she introduced with her colleague Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE   calling on President Bush to declare lung cancer a national public health priority  The resolution calls on the President to increase funding for lung cancer research  develop early detection lung cancer screening programs and appoint an advisory committee to oversee and coordinate efforts to reduce lung cancer mortality rates            Lung cancer is not a political issue    it  s a health issue  Lung cancer touches millions of families and the implications are just as far reaching     Senator Clinton said    I want to commend my Senate colleagues for passing this resolution  We all need to do our part to increase awareness of lung cancer and to support ongoing early detection and treatment research and this resolution sends a strong message that we are together in fighting this terrible disease               A coordinated  comprehensive effort by the federal government to reduce the lung cancer mortality rate is critical  It is estimated that over 900 Nebraskans will die of lung cancer in 2006  This resolution is a positive step in our efforts to detect and prevent this deadly disease     said Senator Hagel           The Senators   resolution outlines some of the steps necessary to address the issues of lung cancer and meet the goal of halving the deaths from this disease by 2015  The resolution calls for the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to establish a coordinated strategy for lung cancer efforts across the department  encompassing research  screening  and drug approval efforts  It also asks the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs  VA  to develop screening and disease management programs for military personnel and veterans  And it calls for the establishment of a National Lung Cancer Public Health Policy Board  along with a Scientific and Medical Advisory Board  to coordinate the federal activities in these areas           A copy of the resolution is attached          109th CONGRESS  2d Session  S  RES  408    Expressing the sense of the Senate that the President should declare lung cancer a public health priority and should implement a comprehensive interagency program that will reduce lung cancer mortality by at least 50 percent by 2015            IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  March 28  2006  Mr  HAGEL  for himself and Mrs  CLINTON  submitted the following resolution  which was referred to the Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions        ________________________________________  RESOLUTION  Expressing the sense of the Senate that the President should declare lung cancer a public health priority and should implement a comprehensive interagency program that will reduce lung cancer mortality by at least 50 percent by 2015           Whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women  accounting for 28 percent of all cancer deaths           Whereas lung cancer kills more people annually than breast cancer  prostate cancer  colon cancer  liver cancer  melanoma  and kidney cancer combined           Whereas  since the National Cancer Act of 1971  Public Law 92 218  85 Stat  778   coordinated and comprehensive research has elevated the 5 year survival rates for breast cancer to 87 percent  for prostate cancer to 99 percent  and colon cancer to 64 percent           Whereas the survival rate for lung cancer is still only 15 percent and a similar coordinated and comprehensive research effort is required to achieve increases in lung cancer survivability rates           Whereas 60 percent of lung cancer is now diagnosed in nonsmokers and former smokers           Whereas 2 3 of nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer are women           Whereas certain minority populations  such as black males  have disproportionately high rates of lung cancer incidence and mortality  notwithstanding their lower smoking rate           Whereas members of the Baby Boomer generation are entering their sixties  the most common age for the development of cancer           Whereas tobacco addiction and exposure to other lung cancer carcinogens such as Agent Orange and other herbicides and battlefield emissions are serious problems among military personnel and war veterans           Whereas the August 2001 Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group of the National Cancer Institute stated that funding for lung cancer research was  far below the levels characterized for other common malignancies and far out of proportion to its massive health impact            Whereas the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group identified as its  highest priority  the creation of integrated  multidisciplinary  multi institutional research consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather than around specific research disciplines  and          Whereas the United States must enhance its response to the issues raised in the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group    Now  therefore  be it          Resolved  That it is the sense of the Senate that the President should             1  declare lung cancer a public health priority and immediately lead a coordinated effort to reduce the mortality rate of lung cancer by 50 percent by 2015            2  direct the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to increase funding for lung cancer research and other lung cancer related programs within a coordinated strategy and defined goals  including             A  translational research and specialized lung cancer research centers            B  expansion of existing multi institutional  population based screening programs incorporating state of the art image processing  centralized review  clinical management  and tobacco cessation protocols            C  research on disparities in lung cancer incidence and mortality rates            D  graduate medical education programs in thoracic medicine and cardiothoracic surgery            E  new programs within the Food and Drug Administration to expedite the development of chemoprevention and targeted therapies for lung cancer            F  annual reviews by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality of lung cancer screening and treatment protocols            G  the appointment of a lung cancer director within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with authority to improve lung cancer surveillance and screening programs  and           H  lung cancer screening demonstration programs under the direction of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services            3  direct the Secretary of Defense  in conjunction with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to develop a broad based lung cancer screening and disease management program among members of the Armed Forces and veterans  and to develop technologically advanced diagnostic programs for the early detection of lung cancer            4  appoint the Lung Cancer Scientific and Medical Advisory Committee comprised of medical  scientific  pharmaceutical  and patient advocacy representatives to work with the National Lung Cancer Public Health Policy Board and to report to the President and Congress on the progress and the obstacles in achieving the goal described in paragraph 1  and           5  convene a National Lung Cancer Public Health Policy Board comprised of multiagency and multidepartment representatives and at least 3 members of the Lung Cancer Scientific and Medical Advisory Committee  that will oversee and coordinate all efforts to accomplish the mission of reducing lung cancer mortality rate by 50 percent by 2015
