                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Westchester County Residents Not Given Sufficient Opportunity to Voice Concerns Over New Air Traffic Plans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC Responding to concerns expressed by Westchester County Executive Andy Spano and local residents  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Congresswoman Nita Lowey are urging the Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  to hold additional hearings regarding the proposed New York New Jersey Philadelphia Airspace Redesign Project   In a letter sent to Marion C  Blakey  Administrator of the FAA  Clinton and Lowey stressed that as this was the first major overhaul of airspace in nearly fifty years  the citizens of Westchester should have an opportunity to adequately address their concerns     This is a massive overhaul of area airspace  the first in more than 50 years  so it is only fair that we have an open dialogue between Westchester residents and the FAA before moving forward with a plan that could dramatically affect the community  Westchester residents must have the opportunity to express their concerns about the current plan and deserve to have their concerns addressed  Senator Clinton said    I remain committed to reducing air noise over Westchester and Rockland  preventing flights over Indian Point  and ensuring that the FAA is engaged in a public and open process as they complete the redesign  Lowey said   This action has potential to change the quality of life in our region  and the public should absolutely have greater participation in this process    Westchester County has already submitted comments objecting to the FAAs proposed Airspace Redesign Project on two separate occasions  However  because there was of a lack of data available to fully analyze the redesign project  it was not possible for the County to complete a thorough review of the plan  The public forum would allow the FAA to open a line of communication directly with local elected officials and citizens  so that their concerns and ideas can be directly addressed by FAA officials     A copy of Senator Clintons letter to Administrator Blakey follows    The Honorable Marion Blakey  Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Avenue  S W   Washington  D C  20591   Dear Ms  Blakey    We write to urge you to immediately schedule a public forum in Westchester County to provide residents with an opportunity to engage in an interactive dialogue with high level Federal Aviation Administration  FAA  officials regarding the proposed New York New Jersey  Philadelphia Airspace Redesign project     It is our understanding that Westchester County has already submitted comments objecting to the FAAs proposal on two separate occasions based on a limited amount of information available  Unfortunately  it was impossible for the County to conduct a more thorough and comprehensive review of the plan in its entirety because it lacked the data needed to fully analyze the proposed redesign well in advance of the closure of the comment period     Thousands of Westchester County residents are already negatively impacted by flights taking off and landing at Westchester County  LaGuardia  and Newark airports   The redesign project will continue to have a profound impact on the quality of life for these residents as well as countless others throughout the region   These individuals  as well as the elected officials who represent them  are working diligently to understand the full repercussions of this proposal  particularly how the redesign proposal will impact individual communities throughout the County  Additional public forums in Westchester County  as have recently been agreed to in Rockland County  will afford residents a more extensive opportunity to adequately understand this proposal as well as ask detailed questions of FAA officials     We feel that you must surely agree that the first major overhaul of airspace in almost 50 years warrants a fair and extensive public notification and comment process  including a sufficient number of public forums to address and alleviate the concerns of individuals most impacted by this plan   We look forward to working with you to facilitate additional public forums in Westchester County and to ensure that our constituents are provided an additional opportunity to participate in the redesign process      Sincerely    Hillary Rodham Clinton  United States Senate                       Nita M  Lowey  United States House of Representatives
