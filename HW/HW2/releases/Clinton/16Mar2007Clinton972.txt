March 16  2007 Senators Clinton  Collins  and Representatives Engel  Fossella Announce Reintroduction of Legislation to Help Fight Growing Rates of Diabetes Striking Pregnant Women Across Nation                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  and Susan M  Collins  R ME  along with Representatives Eliot Engel  D NY  and Vito Fossella  R NY  announced today that they have reintroduced companion legislation in both chambers of Congress to combat growing rates of diabetes striking pregnant women across the nation   The Gestational Diabetes  GEDI  Act is aimed at lowering the incidence of gestational diabetes  which puts women at increased risk for complications during childbirth and puts their children at increased risk for developing debilitating Type 2 diabetes as adolescents or adults             Gestational diabetes affects women and children across New York State   In New York City alone  the disorder has risen by a staggering 50 percent in the last decade   This should be a call to action   The tragic fact is that gestational diabetes is preventable  but too many women unknowingly put themselves and their children at risk   We need to raise awareness of this condition and do everything we can to turn these alarming statistics around   said Senator Clinton            Our legislation will help to stem the growing epidemic of gestational diabetes in our country  which puts the health of both mother and child at risk   said Senator Collins    The evidence is clear that there is a direct link between gestational diabetes and Type 2 diabetes   The GEDI Act will help to identify new treatments and interventions that will reduce the incidence of the disorder and the subsequent risk of mother and child developing Type 2 diabetes in the future            The growing problem of Gestational diabetes in pregnant women is a public health crisis we must act on today   In New York City  gestational diabetes has risen by nearly 50 percent in about 10 years  an astounding statistic  Gestational diabetes has long lasting effects not just for mothers but for their children  putting them at higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes   Our legislation will significantly expand on research efforts at the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  and National Institutes of Health  NIH  so that we may better understand gestational diabetes  Further  our bill will provide grants to states to employ innovative  community based prevention and treatment strategies to control this serious disease   said Congressman Engel            This legislation will bring much needed attention to a disease that is affecting increasing numbers of American women each year   It is essential that we foster new and unique approaches to educate about gestational diabetes and to develop more effective means of intervention to reduce the risk for women and children   We need to take action to curb the rates of gestational diabetes  as well as the overall incidence of diabetes in this country  I believe an expansion in resources and improved data collection provided for in this bill is an important step   said Congressman Fossella           Gestational diabetes is a disorder that affects between four to eight percent of pregnant women in the United States and the numbers are growing   More women than ever are entering pregnancy overweight  which can trigger gestational diabetes and threaten the health of both the mother and child   Genetics  ethnicity  and maternal age are other risk factors for the disease            New therapies and interventions to detect  treat  and slow the incidence of this disorder need to be identified   The GEDI Act will support increased understanding of the factors that contribute to this condition and help mothers who develop gestational diabetes reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes   The GEDI Act will create a Research Advisory Committee headed by the CDC to monitor gestational diabetes and obesity during pregnancy to develop methods to prevent onset of Type 2 diabetes   Also  the Act will allocate funding through demonstration grants for projects to assist health care providers and communities in finding ways to reach out to women so they better understand how their health during pregnancy will impact their own as well as their child s health   The bill will also expand on current research by the NIH and the CDC to help lower the incidences of gestational diabetes            The GEDI Act is supported by the following organizations  American Diabetes Association  National Research Center for Women   Families  Society for Women s Health Research  International Community Health Services  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists  American Association of Diabetes Educators  American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy  National Association of Chronic Disease Directors  Association of Women s Health  Obstetric  and Neonatal Nurses Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations          The GEDI Act was first introduced in the 109th Congress by Senators Clinton and Collins  The companion bill in the House of Representatives was also introduced during the 109th Congress by Representatives Engel and Fossella
