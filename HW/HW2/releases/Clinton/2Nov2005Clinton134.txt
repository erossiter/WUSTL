November 2  2005 Senator Clinton Saves Dolgeville Head Start Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton won unanimous Senate approval of a measure that will allow the Dolgeville  New York Head Start program to continue providing vital services to local children and families   Senator Clinton learned that the Dolgeville program was on the verge of having to close its doors because of the cost of complying with a federal regulation set to go into effect for the Dolgeville Head Start program in January 2006   In response  Senator Clinton secured passage late last week of an amendment that gives the Dolgeville Head Start program an additional six months to come into compliance          I am proud to help the Dolgeville Head Start program continue to serve local children and families   This is a situation where a well intentioned federal regulation was in danger of compromising the ability of a local agency to serve children with Head Start services   By extending the compliance deadline  the Dolgeville Head Start program will be able to continue operating with no interruption in services             I cannot express how pleased we are that Senator Clinton not only heard and understood our concern but empathized with our situation enough to stand up and make a difference for our small community     said Melissa Hoskey  Head Start Director of the Dolgeville Head Start Delegate Site    Without her voice I do not believe that the pleas of a rural  high need district would have been heard  Our current Head Start families  as well as the hundreds of others that we will serve in the future  owe Senator Clinton and Senator Harkin an enormous debt of gratitude for preserving one of the most precious commodities in our small learning community  the right to a quality education for all families           Federal regulations require that Head Start programs that provide transportation services supply a bus monitor on each of their routes   The Dolgeville program  which services 18 children  provides transportation for many families who otherwise would have no other way to bring their children to the Head Start program   Without Senator Clinton  s action  the Dolgeville program would have been required to provide a paid bus monitor on each of its eight transportation routes   This requirement  which applies no matter how many children are served on a route  would have increased costs for the Dolgeville program by  80 000 a year  compromising its ability to continue operating
