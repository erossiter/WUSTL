                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Clinton joined several of her colleagues on the Helsinki Commission  calling on Prime Minister Ference Gyurcsany of Hungary to ensure that the Hungarian Government cooperates with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum   The Museum has experienced trouble accessing several major categories of archival records and extensive collections  held by the Hungarian Government          The work of the United States Holocaust Museum is a critical part of our ongoing process of remembrance     Senator Clinton said    I know that the Prime Minister of Hungary recognizes the importance of these efforts  I hope he will take the necessary steps to open these files           The letter was sent to Prime Minister Gyurcsany following reports that U S  Holocaust Museum has experienced trouble accessing several major categories of Hungarian State Archives and Budapest Municipal Archives   These collections  which address some of the most important topics relating to the Holocaust in Hungary such as military records  deportation records and property expropriation records  continue to be inaccessible to the Museum despite numerous promises from the Hungarian Government        The Helsinki Commission is an independent U S  Government agency created in 1976 to monitor and encourage compliance throughout Europe with the Helsinki Final Act and contribute to the formulation of U S  policy           A copy of the Helsinki Commission  s letter is attached        April 5  2005   E  Ferenc Gyurcsany  Prime Minister of Hungary   Budapest  Hungary        Dear Mr  Prime Minister         We write regarding the difficulties which we understand the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has encountered in its archival work in Hungary  We respectfully urge your government to cooperate fully with the vital work of the Museum in advancing Holocaust education and research  including by granting timely access for their researchers to all Holocaust related archival materials in Hungary         While the Museum  s access to the Hungarian State Archives and the Budapest Municipal Archives has been satisfactory  there are several major categories of archival records and extensive collections  held by the Hungarian Government  which continue to be inaccessible to the Museum despite numerous promises otherwise  These archival collections address some of the most important topics relating to the Holocaust in Hungary and include  military records related to the forced labor of Jews  records related to the deportation of Jews  including the deportation records from 1944  records of the Hungarian gendarmerie  records of the investigation of the Kamenets Podolsk massacre  property expropriation records  and various categories of records that during the communist era would have been in the custody of the country  s intelligence agencies  Access has also been blocked to the records of the war time and post World War II Jewish organizations which were active in Hungary   records that may also have been held by the country  s intelligence services         Representatives of the Holocaust Museum have been told that the collections vanished in war time bombardments or during the 1956 revolution  While it is conceivable that some document may have been destroyed  it seems highly unlikely and dubious that the entire records of the most sensitive part of the history of the Holocaust in Hungary would have vanished         Due to their access to records of the Ministries of Interior in other ex communist countries the Museum has had a wealth of information on the Holocaust at their disposal  Regrettably  in Hungary  the Historical Archives of the State Security Agencies  ABTL   which include a portion of the records of the former communist Ministry of Internal Affairs  has granted the Museum access to only 365 files over a three year period  and have not even shared with the Museum  s researchers reliable information regarding the full extent of ABTL archival holdings         Mr  Prime Minister  we commend you for your recent remarks during the Commemoration of the Victims of Communism when you said   The new Hungary will be able to be born  when she has a chance to look into the eyes of the old Hungary       The generations of Hungarians who live today are not responsible for the crimes of the past  but it is our duty to remember and to make each other to remember     Access to the archival records will contribute significantly to remembrance more than six decades after the Holocaust         We respectfully request the Hungarian Government to effectively and fully cooperate with the representatives of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in its archival work in Hungary  Thank you for your consideration of this request in fulfilling our common   duty to remember         Sincerely           Sam Brownback  U S S   Chairman    Christopher H  Smith  M C   Co Chairman
