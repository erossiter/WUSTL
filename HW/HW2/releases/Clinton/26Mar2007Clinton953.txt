                                                                                                                                                                                                                       News Report Shows Insurance Companies Shifting Healthcare Costs to Medicaid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC   Following a news report showing thousands of seniors struggling with denied claims by long term care insurance providers  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today called on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to investigate the impact on the Medicaid program of insurance companies denying payment for care promised under their policies  In a letter to David Walker  Comptroller General of the United States and head of the GAO  Senator Clinton underscored that by denying claims to seniors who paid for policies  insurance companies are forcing Medicaid to pick up the tab for needed care  further straining already stretched state budgets and putting more stress on the healthcare safety net            When it comes to navigating the health care maze  confusion and administrative hurdles are insurance companies  best friends  Seniors buy long term care insurance policies to plan for their future needs  It is unconscionable that insurance companies are not only undermining long term care for seniors  they re also sticking taxpayers with the bill  We owe it to our seniors to make insurance companies live up to their promises and it s critical for the future of our healthcare system that we get this right   said Senator Clinton           The letter also asks the GAO to investigate enforcement of federal standards included in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  HIPAA  which are designed to protect consumers from such abuses and recommend needed changes           The following is the text of Senator Clinton s letter to Comptroller General David Walker           The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  United States Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  N W   Washington  D C  20548      Dear Mr  Walker       An article in today s New York Times underscores a growing concern I have regarding the treatment of seniors who have purchased private long term care insurance policies   Based on a review of more than 400 complaints and lawsuits  the article highlights the practices of a number of insurance companies designed to reduce or eliminate the payment of legitimate claims            I am very concerned about the impact of these practices  which will undoubtedly result in considerable cost shifting to the Medicaid program   A 2006 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 52 percent of all Medicaid spending is devoted to beneficiaries using long term care services   As the baby boomers age  the demand for long term care will only increase  placing greater burden on the health care system and on federal and state budgets   Forcing seniors who have paid for private long term care insurance to turn to Medicaid should not be tolerated    I would ask that you investigate the impact of these practices on the Medicaid program and provide information about the financial impact on federal and state budgets          In addition  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 put in place consumer protection standards for private long term care insurance in exchange for favorable tax treatment   These protections include a description of the policy s benefits and limitations  which allows seniors to compare policies offered by different companies   Companies must report annually on the number of claims they deny as well as information on policy terminations   The law also prohibits a company from canceling a policy except for nonpayment of premiums   And with a few exceptions  policies that limit or exclude coverage by type of treatment  medical condition  or accident are prohibited   In addition  insurance companies must follow certain administrative and marketing practices or face fines   And some states have adopted stronger state regulations to ensure seniors are protected          I would ask that you investigate how well these minimum federal long term care insurance protections are being enforced  and make recommendations for where federal law should be adjusted  if consumer protections are inadequate   In addition  information regarding state policies that provide stronger consumer protections which have prevented these types of problems would also be appreciated          As Congress explores ways to encourage the purchase of private long term care insurance  we must ensure that these policies provide the coverage and care that seniors need and think they have paid for   Thank you for your attention to this matter          Sincerely yours       Hillary Rodham Clinton
