December 19  2007 Senator Clinton Reintroduces Legislation to Link Congressional Pay Raises to Increase in the Federal Minimum Wage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that she has reintroduced her legislation to link Congressional pay increases to increases in the federal minimum wage   In addition to gradually raising the federal minimum wage  the bill would also require the federal minimum wage to be increased by the same percentage amount as Congressional salaries every year     If we in Congress can give ourselves a raise  surely we can raise the pay of working families struggling to make ends meet   Even as Congress gave itself pay increases year after year  it took Congress ten long years to increase the minimum wage for the rest of America   My bill would ensure that working families faced with a rising cost of living each year are not forced to wait another ten years for an increase in the minimum wage   This is the right and fair thing to do for hardworking Americans  said Senator Clinton    The bill  the Standing with Minimum Wage Earners Act of 2007  was inspired by an idea submitted to SinceSlicedBread com  the Service Employees International Unions contest that asked Americans for bold ideas that would make life better for working families    In 1989  Congress passed legislation that provided for an automatic salary increase for its Members every year tied to an inflation adjusted cost of living allowance  COLA   Congress can decline to accept the pay raise and has done so five times since the automatic increase was put into effect   Pursuant to this new law  Congress in 1991 also gave itself a 25 percent salary increase to make up for past years when its salary remained unchanged     In the decade since Congress last increased the minimum wage  Members of Congress raised their own salaries by  31 600  while refusing to raise the pay of millions of hardworking parents who were struggling to make ends meet on the minimum wage     Senator Clinton is a strong advocate of increasing the minimum wage  Senator Clinton was an original cosponsor and vocal supporter of legislation that was introduced by Senator Kennedy and enacted into law earlier this year to increase the federal minimum wage to  7 25 per hour over a two year period
