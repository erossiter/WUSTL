February 9  2005 Senator Clinton Introduces Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton   NY  joined senate colleague Lindsey Graham  SC  today in introducing the Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005  This bipartisan legislation would promote recruitment  readiness  and retention by offering TRICARE eligibility  military healthcare benefits  to members of the Guard and Reserve for a modest monthly premium  The legislation would also reduce the age at which a Reservist can receive retirement benefits based on his or her years of experience          Members of the National Guard and Reserves  in New York and elsewhere  are making incredible sacrifices as they serve their country with courage and distinction   Senator Clinton said   TRICARE shows that we care and honor the service national guard and reserve members valiantly give our nation  Providing the U S  National Guard and Reserves  as well as their families  with adequate health care is the least a grateful nation can do          This legislation contains two major provisions        1  Retirement   Currently  Reservists and Guardsmen receive retirement benefits at age 60  With this legislation  however  for every two years of service over twenty  a Guardsman or Reservist would receive benefits one year earlier  For example  after 22 years of service  a member of the Reserve Component would receive benefits at the age of 59  instead of 60  after 24 years of service  the member would become eligible for retirement at 58 and so on  Thus  if someone joined when they were 18 and served for 34 years  they could retire at 53         2  Healthcare  Currently  Reservists and Guardsmen are only eligible for TRICARE if they are on active duty  This legislation would extend TRICARE to all persons whether they are active duty or not  They would only be required to pay monthly premiums  which should provide some relief for self employed personnel  who pay large sums for health coverage or have none at all  Because the Guard and Reserve are part time  a co payment would be necessary         In October 2004  Senator Clinton co sponsored legislation that was part of the approved Department of Defense Authorization bill  which provided an extension of TRICARE to Guard and Reserve members for an additional year for every 90 days the Reservist or Guardsman serve  This new legislation would lift the 90 day cap and simply allow any Guardsman or Reservist to buy into TRICARE at any time         Other co sponsors of the Guard and Reserve Readiness and Retention Act of 2005 include Senators George Allen  R  VA   Maria Cantwell  D  WA   Mike Dewine  R  OH   Patrick Leahy  D  VT  and Harry Reid  D  NV
