April 29  2005 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the President s Proposal to Privatize Social Security and Cut Benefits                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington  DC     President Bush has finally admitted what we ve known all along  the President plans to cut Social Security benefits  No one should be fooled by the President s suggestion that low income workers would be protected  The truth is that his plan to privatize Social Security would result in a substantial benefit cut for most workers  including middle class workers         What the President didn t say is that his proposal would eventually result in a more than 40 percent benefit cut for middle class retirees  For example  once fully phased in  a worker who earned  37 000 per year would face a 28 percent benefit cut  A worker who earned  58 000 per year would have a 42 percent benefit cut  And it would apply to everyone regardless of whether or not they choose to open a private account  Those who do open a private account would face a  privatization tax  that could wipe out what s left of their entire guaranteed benefit  To make matters worse  the President s plan will saddle future generations with trillions of dollars in new debt        Retirement security is a critical issue and we must get it right    but  first  we must do no harm  Americans should get the benefits they have paid for and we should strengthen Social Security without undermining its fundamental purpose
