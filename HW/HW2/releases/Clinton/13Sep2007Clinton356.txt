September 13  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in Response to the President s Address to the Nation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Regrettably  the President did not seize the opportunity tonight to offer the American people a candid assessment of the challenges that we continue to face in Iraq  or offer a change in course to his failing strategy   Instead  he portrayed an unavoidable reduction in U S  troops to pre surge levels as a marker of progress   Redeploying over the next year five of the twenty combat brigades currently deployed in Iraq will merely bring our total number of troops back to the same level that existed before the President announced his escalation in January of this year   As was discussed during General Petraeus s testimony this week  troop levels in Iraq must decrease by this amount regardless  in order to avoid extending Army deployments beyond 15 months and straining our military even further than it already is      What the President told the American people tonight is that one year from now  there will be the same number of troops in Iraq as there were one year ago   That is simply too little too late  and unacceptable to this Congress and the American people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our brave troops home    The Commander in Chief has the authority to issue the order to greatly accelerate the redeployment of U S  forces from Iraq  and to bring so many more of our troops home so much faster    They have done everything we have asked of them and more  but are now stuck in the middle of a civil war   I continue to implore the President to change course  bring our troops home faster  and end this war responsibly as soon as possible
