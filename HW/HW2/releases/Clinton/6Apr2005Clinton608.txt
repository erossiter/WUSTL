April 6  2005 Senator Clinton Calls for Immediate Implementation of Nuclear Security Recommendations of The National Academy of Sciences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       NAS Report Released Today Recommends Steps to Reduce Vulnerability of Spent Fuel to Terrorist Attacks  Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton called on the U S  Nuclear Regulatory Commission to implement the nuclear plant security recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences  NAS  released today in a report to Congress  entitled   Safety and Security of Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage             Given that we know that nuclear plants are potentially attractive terrorist targets  it is incumbent upon the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to immediately implement these recommendations to improve the safety and security of spent fuel     said Senator Clinton     If the NRC does not act promptly  I will introduce legislation requiring them to do so         The NAS report was conducted at the direction of Congress  and focuses on the vulnerability of spent nuclear fuel storage facilities to theft and attack   There are two methods of spent nuclear fuel storage at nuclear plants  in pools of water  known as   spent fuel pools     and in and   dry casks     which are steel cylinders containing an inert gas and are surrounded by additional steel or concrete  Dry casks can be used to store fuel that has already been cooled in a spent fuel pool for at least one year   The report  s primary recommendations include           The NRC should review and upgrade  where necessary  its security requirements for protecting spent fuel rods not contained in fuel assemblies from theft by knowledgeable insiders             The NRC should undertake additional best estimate analyses to more fully understand the vulnerability and consequences of loss of pool events that could lead to a zirconium cladding fire   Based on these analyses  the NRC should take appropriate actions to address any significant vulnerabilities that are identified   While this analysis is being conducted  the NRC should ensure that power plant operators take prompt and effective measures to reduce the consequences of such an event  including reconfiguration of spent fuel pools and provision for water sprays systems             The NRC should consider using the results of the above vulnerability assessments to improve the resistance of dry casks to terrorist attacks               An assessment of the security measures for protecting stored spent fuel should be performed by an independent organization      New York State has nuclear power plants in three locations   Fitzpatrick and Nine Mile Point reactors  which are located in Oswego  NY  Ginna  located in Rochester  NY  and Indian Point  located in Buchanan  NY
