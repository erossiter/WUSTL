March 31  2006 Statement by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Today  s Announcements by Delphi Corporation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Washington  DC      Having spoken with Mr  Miller  I am encouraged that the Lockport and Rochester Delphi plants have been designated as core facilities and will play a role in the company  s operations moving forward   Clearly  Delphi  s leadership has recognized what we know  that both facilities in New York and its workers are an indispensable component not just of Delphi  but of the entire auto industry   Nevertheless  I am concerned about the motions filed in the bankruptcy court and the effect it may have on the ongoing negotiations   It is critical that Delphi puts forth an equitable and workable plan to fulfill its commitment to New York s auto workers  I remain committed to working with the UAW  New York  s Delphi employees  and the Delphi leadership team to ensure an ongoing  constructive dialogue that will yield positive results for New York  s auto industry and its workers
