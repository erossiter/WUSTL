September 28  2006 Clinton Releases Report that Details Crippling Canadian Trade Barriers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Report Shows Almost All New York Grown Products   Including Apples and other Fruits  Vegetables  Dairy and Wine   Face Barriers to Trade with Canada  Impacting Sales and Growth     Senator Calls on Canadian Government to Remove Unfair Trade Barriers to New York Farmers and Introduces Legislation to Study the Impact of America  s Trade Agreements Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today released a report that details the devastating impact of Canadian trade practices on New York  s farmers and growers          The report  compiled by the Senator  s office  with the help of the New York Apple Association  the New York Horticulture Society  the Northeast Council of Dairy Cooperatives  the New York Farm Bureau and the Empire State Potato Growers  details the impact of Canadian subsidies and trade barriers on dairy  fruits  vegetables  wine and agricultural products and concludes that while Canadian growers have little problem accessing New York markets for their produce  New York farmers and growers experience severe restrictions on selling their products in Canada          A full copy of the report  along with a list of farmers and trade organizations who contributed to its contents can be found here            Years after we signed a Free Trade Agreement with Canada  our farmers and growers have not seen Canadian markets opened or sales to Canada increasing  Instead  when they look to Canada  they might as well see a huge   closed for business   sign  For many upstate New York producers  Canada is their closest major metropolitan market but New York farmers face incredible challenges when they attempt to export their products over the border     Senator Clinton said          As early as 2002  Senator Clinton urged the United States Trade Representative to address Canadian bulk exemption trade barriers that affected New York apple growers  who agreed at the time that action should be taken            These barriers are unfair and unjustified and they are hurting New York  s farmers who deserve fair market access   The Canadian Government must address these costly and time consuming barriers to trade with New York  which are unfairly disadvantaging New York producers     Senator Clinton said          The Senator  s report identifies several examples of Canadian trade barriers that effectively keep New York dairy  fruits and vegetables  wine and horticultural products from entering the Canadian market   The magnitude of Canadian trade barriers is especially striking when one compares the example of New York apple exports to Canada with New York apple exports to the United Kingdom   New York ships two to three times more apples to the United Kingdom than to Canada  despite the fact that New York shares a border with Canada with markets mere miles away  while the United Kingdom is thousands of miles away and across the Atlantic Ocean          Highlights of the report include            According to the USTR s 2006 Foreign Trade Barriers report  Canada prohibits the import of fresh fruits and vegetables in packages exceeding certain standard sizes unless the Government of Canada grants an official exemption  Exemptions are generally granted only when there is a proven insufficiency of the product in the Canadian market            Canada is a producer of apples  so bulk shipments of New York apples to Canada are not typically granted a Ministerial Exemption from Provincial governments  These exemptions  or bulk waivers  are required for every load of   bulk    apples purchased  by Canada  from the U S  and are only granted when there are no Canadian apples available of the specified variety and grade             One New York vegetable producer reported that of the several thousand loads they produce and ship from their farm in a single year  they may only get two or three loads into Canada  even though their farm is only 110 miles from Toronto  a metropolitan market of several million people             Lenient U S  import regulations may have implications for the introduction of foreign plant diseases and pathogens            The commercial wine industry in New York State is severely disadvantaged by Canadian regulations and an unjust border situation  Individuals entering Canada through Ontario are allowed only two bottles per person duty free  Beyond that  the Ontario Liquor Board levies a 100 percent duty on each additional bottle            Canada uses high duty rates and bureaucratic obstacles to limit the amount of New York milk allowed into Canada  Canada has long supply managed the amount of dairy  poultry  and eggs available to Canadian consumers             New York producers have tried repeatedly to ship fluid and raw milk to Canada  often without success  In many cases  New York producers have been unable to obtain the required documents from Canadian authorities despite already having signed contracts with Canadian processing companies            While the Canadians make it difficult for New York farmers to access Canadian markets  the United States allows Canadian dairy products to be sold in U S  markets  For example  the United States allows the entry of unpasteurized raw milk into the U S  for processing if the supplier applies for and receives proper permits from State Health Departments            In 1999  Canada stopped allowing duty free entry of snack foods from the United States  and imposed a TRQ on cheese snacks with an over quota tariff of 245  ad valorem            New York horticultural producers complain that Canada imposes many import barriers  such as specific growing practices and phytosanitary requirements that make it difficult for U S  producers to comply and penetrate the Canadian market          A copy of the report was sent to the United States Trade Ambassador  Susan Schwab and to the Canadian Ambassador          Senator Clinton also introduced legislation today that would require the International Trade Commission to report on the effects of every trade agreement that is signed by the United States  The reports would be designed to study the impact of every trade agreement two and five years after it goes into effect and then every five years thereafter on a sector by sector basis  The reports would also be required to offer an assessment and a quantitative analysis of how each agreement is fostering economic growth  improving living standards and creating jobs in the United States       Click here to read the report
