January 25  2006 Senator Clinton Calls For Immediate Action To Provide Low Income Families With Home Heating Assistance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today joined Senate colleagues in urging an immediate increase in funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance  LIHEAP  Program   In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  Clinton called on Frist to bring a measure to the floor that provides an additional  2 92 billion for the LIHEAP program  an increase supported by the majority of the Senate but blocked repeatedly by the Senate Republican leadership   This increase would boost funding for New York by  500 million  helping New York families struggling with staggering home heating costs this winter              High energy prices are threatening the health and economic well being of low income households across the United States   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions or paying utility bills   Unfortunately  these stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the nation   We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help low income Americans by bringing a measure to the floor that provides an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   as supported by the majority of the Senate   American families and seniors have been waiting too long for relief from high energy costs     the Senators wrote          LIHEAP  which offers federal funds to help low income households meet their home heating needs  will be critical to help thousands of low income New Yorkers make ends meet this winter as they struggle to cope with the soaring cost and diminishing availability of home heating fuel   Last year  an estimated 800 000 New Yorkers received LIHEAP assistance  with benefits ranging from  150 to  400 per household   However  the program has been losing ground to inflation and a significant increase in funding is needed to even keep pace with last year           Adding to the financial strain  the U S  Department of Energy projects that heating costs will be 27 percent higher this year for New York households that use natural gas and 25 percent for those that use home heating oil over last winter  s costs   Statewide  these additional costs are expected to be at least  1 7 billion over last year and colder weather could increase these estimates even further             Senator Clinton is working on all fronts to help New Yorkers who are affected by the skyrocketing energy prices and to address our long term energy challenges   Senator Clinton helped launch the Democrats   Energy Independence 2020 plan in New York City  Senator Clinton has called for a new national energy strategy to help consumers and stimulate energy alternatives and challenged the oil industry to reinvest their profits in America  s energy future or contribute to a new Strategic Energy Fund  Senator Clinton has also pressed the Bush Administration to investigate gas price gouging           Today  s letter also was signed by Senators Reed  Kennedy  Cantwell  Boxer  Stabenow  Schumer  Sarbanes  Dorgan  Kohl  Mikulski  Baucus  Bingaman  Obama  Akaka  Harkin  Dayton  Biden  Levin  Kerry  and Leahy          The following is the text of the letter          The Honorable William H  Frist    Majority Leader     United States Senate     Washington  DC 20510            Dear Majority Leader Frist          High energy prices are threatening the health and economic well being of low income households across the United States   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions or paying utility bills   Unfortunately  these stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the nation   We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help low income Americans by bringing a measure to the floor that provides an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   as supported by the majority of the Senate          Since October 5  2005  the Senate has voted six times to increase LIHEAP funding to  5 1 billion   Bipartisan amendments offered to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill  the Transportation  Treasury and HUD Appropriations bill  the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  and the Tax Reconciliation bill received a majority of the Senate  s support   Unfortunately  these amendments were not given the opportunity for a straight up or down vote   In December  63 Senators supported a successful motion to instruct  which directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Committee to provide  2 92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006   Yet  the conference report for the Budget Reconciliation bill includes only  1 billion  with this spending designated for FY 2007   Procedural maneuvers are preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans   These families and seniors deserve help from the federal government          As you know  the Department of Defense  DoD  Appropriations Conference report originally provided an additional  2 billion for LIHEAP   The LIHEAP funding provided by the DoD conferees was designated as emergency funding   The emergency designation funding is warranted given the high cost of energy this winter  and the lack of growth in workers   wages   Unfortunately  other more controversial matters included in the conference report prevented the retention of the LIHEAP money in final action on that bill            The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households heating with natural gas will experience an average increase of 35 percent over last winter   Households heating with oil will see an increase of 23 percent  and households using propane can expect an increase of 17 percent   In addition  wages are not keeping pace with inflation   The Real Earnings report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly earnings of production and non supervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls were lower in December 2005 than they were a year ago  after accounting for inflation   Working families are continuing to lose ground  meaning more families also need LIHEAP assistance this year   Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families face higher prices for home heating  health care  and education      We respectfully request that you bring a measure to the Senate floor at the end of this month  or at the latest  early February  that funds LIHEAP at the  5 1 billion level supported by the Senate   We also urge that these resources be allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly   American families and seniors have been waiting too long for relief from high energy costs   Thank you for your consideration for this essential request
