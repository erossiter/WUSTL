May 17  2005 Senate Committee Approves Clinton Push  to Protect Pay for Wounded Troops                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced a significant victory for wounded soldiers    including active duty  National Guard members and Reservists   with the approval by the Senate Armed Services Committee of a provision to make sure they do not lose their combat pay allowance while they are in hospital          It is unacceptable that our service members can lose their combat pay while they are recovering   Senator Clinton said   They have put their lives on the line for us  The last thing we should be doing is placing an intolerable burden on their families in return for their sacrifice           This provision is especially important to our Guard members and Reservists who have often sacrificed their steady income at home to serve   Senator Clinton said   I am pleased that the Senate Armed Services has passed this provision so that we can stop this practice and give our service members and their families the support they deserve  I hope the full Senate follows suit          Under current law  when a soldier is sent to a military hospital in the United States  they lose their combat pay allowance after 90 days  The new provision  approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of the FY 2006 Department of Defense  DOD  Authorization bill  allows wounded servicemembers to continue to receive combat pay as long as they are hospitalized         Senator Clinton has made the treatment of wounded soldiers one of her top priorities  The Senator raised the issue at a hearing of the Armed Services Committee last month where she won agreement from the Secretaries of the Armed Services to address the issue of wounded troops  pay and obtained a pledge from each of them to make sure that wounded Guard members and reservists wouldn t lose their combat pay allowance while they are in a military hospital        Senator Clinton has also co sponsored legislation with Senator Jay Rockefeller  WV  requiring that a member of the uniformed services who is wounded or otherwise injured while serving in a combat zone continue to be paid monthly military pay and allowances while injured  The bill would also continue the combat zone tax exclusion for the servicemember during their recovery period
