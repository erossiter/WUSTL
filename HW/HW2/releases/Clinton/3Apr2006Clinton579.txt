    New York farmers produce an amazing diversity of high quality agricultural products that consumers value and demand   Colleges and food service providers across the state have already shown their enthusiasm for local New York agricultural products and the growing interest that many have in developing a healthy  sustainable food culture on our college campuses also provides a great way for us to promote New York agriculture     Senator Clinton said    This meeting is the perfect opportunity to facilitate the discussion and connections needed to help make this a reality on campuses throughout New York State  I am very pleased to be working together with the Commission and the Culinary Institute on this shared endeavor  The time is ripe to highlight and promote   Farm to Fork   initiatives on college campuses  which is what this meeting is all about               Senator Clinton  s creative   Farm to Fork   program has already built bridges connecting New York State farmers and producers to new markets  Our efforts today will expand and encourage additional local buying partnerships between our state  s farms and independent colleges and universities  The collaboration makes good sense  On campus  students and staff reap the benefits of eating fresh  seasonal food  and in the community  entrepreneurs find a ready market for their goods and services  Along the way
