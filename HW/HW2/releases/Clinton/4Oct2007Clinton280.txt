October 4  2007 Schumer  Clinton Announce Senate Approval of  12 Million in Defense Funding for the Greater Rochester Region                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Funds Included in Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Washington  DC  Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed approval by the full Senate of the Fiscal Year 2008 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill  which includes  12 million for the Greater Rochester Region  including  3 million for Delphis Accelerating Fuel Cells Manufacturability   3 million for the Infotonics Research Center   2 million for RITs Defense Modernization and Sustainment Initiative   2 million for General Motors Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion  and  2 million for General Motors Future Fuel Non Tactical Vehicle Initiative     The bill will now proceed to a Conference Committee where the House and Senate will resolve the differences between their versions  Following conference  the bill will again be sent to the House and Senate for final approval  after which it will be sent to the President for his signature    This Senate approval is wonderful news for the greater Rochester region and a vital step in the appropriations process  said Schumer  These critical funds will help us ensure that in defending our nation  we are equipped with the most cutting edge technology and know how  All of the institutions awarded here are doing research and work that will boost both our national defense and the Rochester regions economy  I will continue to firmly push this bill through the appropriations process    Approval of this bill by the Senate is wonderful news for the Greater Rochester region  and it is the next step in ensuring these key projects receive this important funding  As these local companies and institutions continue to build their capacity in support of our men and women in uniform  so too they build the reputation of the region and their own role in support of the local economy  This is an important investment in the Greater Rochester region for many reasons  not only are we supporting our troops serving overseas and at home  but we are also investing in local technology  local jobs  and the regions reputation for cutting edge research and development  Senator Clinton said   Delphi  Accelerating Fuel Cells Manufacturability    3 Million Funding will help to accelerate the application of fuel cells for a wide range of DoD electrical power needs  including  but not limited to  ships and submarines  soldier power  ground vehicles  mobile electric power for bases and other field equipment  and aircraft   In particular  this project will enable the DoD to advance fuel cell manufacturing feasibility and readiness for field testing   Infotonics Research Center  Infotonics Research    3 Million The National Center for Infotonics is a collaboration between New York State research universities and the photonics industry to accelerate research and technology commercialization and transfer and industry development in photonics and micro systems   Dozens of companies involved in photonics and micro systems are working with a number of research universities in New York State to develop a comprehensive approach to solving problems facing the photonics and micro systems industries and make them more competitive internationally   Photonics and micro systems will be the key components in many future technologies and weapons systems   Funding will support research into photonics and micro systems applications for defense applications  including Measurement and Control Systems  Information and Communications Systems and Power Technologies   Technologies developed at the National Center for Infotonics will also have chem bio detection and health monitoring applications     RIT  Defense Modernization and Sustainment Initiative    2 Million Funding will be used to improve the modernization  readiness and sustainment of defense systems by developing processes and tools to track the status and future health of defense systems  detect  diagnose and repair material aging failures  and provide decision support systems for use in determining when and how to upgrade these systems   The Department of Defense  while developing new systems that will enable advances in military capability  must simultaneously maintain and improve the capabilities of existing systems   The number and complexity of legacy systems  as well as the replacement costs  demand that attention and resources continue to be effectively allocated to current systems   This research program provides DoD with a comprehensive approach to address these issues based on life cycle engineering principles   Over the past several years  these programs have already yielded significant cost savings for the manufacture and upgrade of several platforms and systems  as well as significantly extending the life of existing systems   For example  one project  out of several that are ongoing as part of this research program  to improve the maintenance and extend the life of the militarys fleet of Light Armored Vehicles  LAVs  is projected to reduce maintenance costs by  2 1 million per year  and  42 million over the life cycle of the platform   In addition  this work will allow the service life of the current fleet to be extended by 20 25 years   These vehicles were originally scheduled for retirement in 2003   General Motors  Next Generation Non Tactical Vehicle Propulsion    2 Million For FY 08  the initiative proposes to demonstrate a commercially based front wheel drive SUV style hydrogen fuel cell vehicle with significantly improved capabilities and performance as compared with earlier vehicles  The lessons learned in this ongoing initiative will bring hydrogen fuel cell vehicles an important step closer to deployment in U S  Army non tactical fleets   General Motors  Future Fuel Non Tactical Vehicle Initiative    2 Million In FY05 and FY06  successful 6 month long demonstrations of a hydrogen fuel cell pick up truck and SUV were completed operating at the USMC installation at Camp Pendleton  CA   It is proposed that the U S  Navy and U S  Marine Corps  USMC  build upon the aforementioned short term demonstrations with an expanded demonstration of  3  Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell vehicles at the USMC installation at Camp Pendleton and an extended vehicle range refueling capability enhancement of the U S  Navy installed hydrogen refueling site at Camp Pendleton
