October 30  2007 Clinton  Schumer Press for Additional AIDS Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Washington  DC   Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E  Schumer wrote to the Chairs of Subcommittees on Labor  Health and Human Services  Education and Related Agencies of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees  urging them to increase funding for domestic AIDS programs in fiscal year 2008  The text of the letter appears below    More than a million Americans are living with HIV  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there are more than 40 000 new infections in the United States each year  Senator Clinton said  We must improve our efforts to reduce new infections  particularly among the minority communities that bear a disproportionate burden of this epidemic  We must also work to ensure that we are providing adequate care  treatment  and support to those living with HIV  and increase appropriations for the Ryan White programs that have largely been flat funded by this administration    The AIDS epidemic is disproportionately afflicting our most vulnerable communities  and demands a heightened response that will address the full impact of this scourge  Schumer said  When it comes to providing resources for these critical programs  doing more of the same is not enough  We must devote the fullest resources possible to each and every facet of our battle against HIV and AIDS     According to the latest data from New York State  in 2005  New York had more than 112 000 residents living with HIV and AIDS  In that year  more than 4 400 New Yorkers were newly diagnosed with HIV  and more than 4 800 New Yorkers received a diagnosis of AIDS  As in other parts of the United States  African American and Latino populations were disproportionately impacted by HIV and AIDS  accounting for approximately 3 4 of cases in New York  Almost 1 3 of those living with HIV and AIDS in New York are women     Senator Clinton has long been active in seeking to address the domestic AIDS epidemic  She has consistently supported increased funding for all titles of the Ryan White CARE Act  through which Americans living with HIV and AIDS can access critically needed treatment and supportive services  She introduced the Early Treatment for HIV Act  which would enable states to expand Medicaid eligibility for low income individuals living with HIV before they become sick  Senator Clinton has also championed access to medically accurate  comprehensive sex education  in order to ensure that individuals have correct information about the ways in which to protect themselves against HIV    The Honorable Tom Harkin  Chairman  Subcommittee on Labor  Health and  Human Services  and Education  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  SD 131  Washington  D C  20510   The Honorable Arlen Specter  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Labor  Health and  Human Services  and Education  Committee on Appropriations  United States Senate  SD 156  Washington  D C  20510   The Honorable David Obey  Chairman  Committee on Appropriations  Subcommittee on Labor  Health and  Human Services  and Education  United States House of Representatives  2358 Rayburn  Washington  D C  20515   The Honorable James Walsh  Ranking Member  Committee on Appropriations  Subcommittee on Labor  Health and  Human Services  and Education  United States House of Representatives  1001 Rayburn  Washington  D C  20515    Dear Chairmen Harkin and Obey and Ranking Members Specter and Walsh    We would like to thank you for including increases for domestic HIV AIDS programs in both the House and Senate versions of the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor HHS Appropriations bill   As you consider these bills in conference  we would request that you adopt the higher appropriation levels for each HIV specific line item between the House and the Senate versions of the bill     HIV AIDS has a devastating effect on communities nationwide  with over 1 million persons currently infected  and more than 40 000 individuals estimated to be contracting the disease each year   We are losing the battle against HIV  treatment efforts  funding levels  and governmental responses have not kept pace with the epidemic   This disease has a particularly devastating effect on minority populations  the incarcerated  and those living in poverty   As Senators from New York State  where more than 100 000 residents are living with HIV and AIDS  we are very much aware of the importance of federal programs to prevent new infections and treat people living with this virus     The Ryan White Care Act provides care and treatment to hundreds of thousands of low income individuals living with HIV AIDS   We would urge you to support an increase of  107 4 million for the Ryan White program over Fiscal Year 2007 funding levels   Specifically  we would ask that you increase Title I by  32 3 million  Title II AIDS Drug Assistance Program  ADAP  funding by  41 million  Title III Early Intervention funding by  23 million  and Title IV Women  Infants and Children funding by  3 5 million  as per the House bill  and Title II base funding by  5 million  as per the Senate bill     We would also respectfully request that you consider increasing the Ryan White AIDS Education and Training Centers  AETCs  by  1 7 million and the Dental Program by  655 000  Although these programs did not receive increased funding in either the House or Senate bill  continued flat funding would be detrimental to their ability to provide services to people with HIV and carry out expanded mandates under the reauthorization of Ryan White   Therefore  we ask that you increase these programs by approximately 5 percent  which is in line with a 5 percent average proposed increase to the other Ryan White programs    We know you understand the need for a strong CDC to ensure the public health of Americans   Combating the more than 40 000 new HIV infections each year requires increased funding for comprehensive HIV prevention programs at the CDC   We would request that you adopt the Houses proposed  17 4 million increase to the CDCs HIV Prevention program     As we work to increase CDCs prevention funding  we would ask that you not fund the Early Diagnosis Grant program  as per the House language   If this program were to be funded  State and local health department HIV prevention grants will be cut 10 percent   This will cripple state and local prevention programs that have already been cut by  26 million since FY2003  Focused efforts to reduce mother to child transmission of HIV have been very successful in the United States  while greater prevention needs have struggled  and we should continue to support those models     We would also ask that you adopt the Senate cut of  28 million to abstinence only until marriage programs  Federally funded research studies prove that abstinence only education programs are not effective  They do not delay the start of sexual activity or decrease the number of sexual partners  often contain medically inaccurate data  and do not teach youth how to protect themselves from HIV infection      Finally  we would ask you to support the Senates proposed  1 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health  NIH  over the Houses  750 million increase   If the United States is to remain the global leader in HIV AIDS research for better drug therapies  evidence based behavioral and biomedical prevention interventions  and vaccines  Congress must adequately invest in NIH     We thank you for your continued support of these HIV programs which provide life saving prevention  care  treatment and support to the many people living with HIV AIDS in the United States       Sincerely    Charles E  Schumer  Hillary Rodham Clinton
