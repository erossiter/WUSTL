February 1  2007 Schumer  Clinton  Bishop  Energy Dept Assures Delegation It Will Fully Fund Brookhaven  s RHIC Program  Significantly Fund NSLS II Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider Program and National Synchotron Light Source II Program Risked Suffering Devastating Funding Cuts   Jeopardizing Research and High Tech Jobs on Long Island    Schumer Called Office of Science Director Orbach Yesterday Seeking Funding Assurances for Programs     Delegation Pledges to Continue to Fight for Full Funding for National Synchotron Light Source II Washington  DC   Following this week  s announcement that the Department of Energy  s Office of Science will receive a  200 million increase for the FY 2007 from its FY 2006 funding level  yesterday  DOE Office of Science Director Raymond Orbach assured Senators Schumer and Clinton and Congressman Bishop that the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  program will be fully funded for FY 2007 and the National Synchotron Light Source II  NSLS II  program will be significantly funded for FY 2007  Orbach  s assurance is a huge victory for Brookhaven National Labs which was girding itself for devastating budget cuts          On Tuesday  Senator Schumer sent a letter to the Office of Science urging it to use its increased budget to fully fund RHIC and NSLS II  Yesterday  Schumer followed up with a phone call to Director Orbach and secured assurances that RHIC would be fully funded and NSLS II would be significantly funded for FY 2007             I  m thrilled that Director Orbach responded so quickly to our request  and that he understands the huge impact Brookhaven  s programs have on our nation  s scientific research and Long Island  s high tech job market     said Senator Schumer    Continued funding for these two cutting edge programs will help ensure that American science remains a global leader               This is a tremendous victory for science and for Long Island     Senator Clinton said    This has been a long fight but I am pleased that the Administration is going to do the right thing for Brookhaven National Lab in this Budget  These much needed funds are absolutely critical to Brookhaven Lab  s continuing scientific research  This announcement not only recognizes the importance of the lab  s research  but is an investment in Long Island  s continued involvement in cutting edge scientific research and development              Full federal funding for the RHIC is good for Long Island and will help secure America s competitive edge in scientific research   Bishop  who also spoke personally with Orbach to confirm that the Office of Science will fully fund the project  said    Advancing this research will also preserve hundreds of jobs held by BNL s highly skilled and dedicated employees   But I also recognize that our scientific community cannot thrive in this unpredictable funding environment   I will work with my colleagues to make sure that as we go forward  we meet the needs of the scientific community and BNL           Yesterday  the Continuing Resolution  CR  passed the House with an increase in funding for the DOE  s Office of Science at  3 796 393 000  an increase of approximately  200 million from FY   06  The FY06 budget for the Department of Energy cut funding for RHIC  Because only 2 of the 11 Appropriations bills were signed into law last year  Appropriators set funding for most federal agencies at the FY06 funding level in the FY07 Continuing Resolution  It  s is expected that the Continuing Resolution will pass the Senate by mid February           Schumer  Clinton and Bishop also pledged to continue fighting for full funding for NSLS II  a new state of the art electron storage ring designed to deliver world leading intensity and brightness  It will produce broad and practical impacts on a wide range of initiatives in nanotechnology  biomedicine  and clean and affordable energy  The funds for design and development for NSLS II would be administered by BNL         The RHIC is a 2 4 mile superconductor that accelerates gold ions to nearly the speed of light and causes collisions that recreate the   Big Bang    offering a glimpse into the birth of the universe during its first few microseconds           Schumer  Clinton and Bishop have been longtime champions for Brookhaven  securing millions to support the lab  s work along with being the leading public official in the accelerated cleanup effort  Schumer helped restore operations funding for the BNL  s major facilities  RHIC  Light Source  and the medical imaging program  These cuts  if allowed  would have been devastating to BNL  The Senator was an early supporter  and continues to be an avid proponent  of the BNL  s Center for Functional Nanomaterials         Brookhaven National Laboratory  established in 1947 and located in Upton  Long Island  is operated by Brookhaven Science Associates for the United States Department of Energy  Brookhaven  s staff of over 3 000 scientists  engineers and technicians specializes in nuclear physics research and has received an impressive six Nobel Prizes for their groundbreaking work  Brookhaven Lab  s programs include the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  RHIC  designated to researching quark gluon plasma  the National Synchrotron Light Source  NSLS   National Synchotron Light Source II  NSLSII   and the Center for Functional Nanomaterials  CFN
