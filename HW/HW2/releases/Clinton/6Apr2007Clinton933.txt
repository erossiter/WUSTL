April 6  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on the United Nations Working Group II Report on Climate Change                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Today s IPCC report shows that global warming is already changing the way that our planet functions and it presents a sobering picture of the massive changes to come if we do not tackle this problem head on   We are already seeing changes in oceans and sea life  in rivers fed by snowpack and glaciers  and in shifting wildlife populations   If we do not take steps to reduce global warming pollution  we are likely to see increased droughts and floods  more intense hurricanes  changes in agricultural systems  increased coastal flooding due to sea level rise  and human health impacts ranging from more widespread hunger in the developing world to more deaths from heat waves in North America   We cannot solve this pressing problem without American leadership   I urge President Bush to work with Congress to put a national program in place to reduce U S  greenhouse gas emission and to return to the table in the ongoing international climate change negotiations
