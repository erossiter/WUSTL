                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Over  500 Million in Contingency Funding Available for Low Income Families                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Washington  DCSenator Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY  today joined Senator Jack Reed  D RI  and a bipartisan group of Senators in calling on President Bush to immediately release  586 million of contingency funding from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    The contingency funding  part of  2 57 billion in LIHEAP funding included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Consolidated Appropriations bill  can be released at the Presidents discretion to aid low income families struggling to pay energy costs    No American child should be forced to live in dangerous and unhealthy conditions because their homes are not adequately heated  but sadly more and more children and families face that unthinkable reality   The President has over half a billion dollars at his discretion that will make this winter more bearable for millions of families   I urge him to immediately release all contingency funds to help low income families offset the heavy burden of energy costs  said Senator Clinton    From 2003 to 2007  the average LIHEAP grant has decreased from  349 to  305 in the face of energy cost increases of up to 80 percent   Senator Clinton has worked hard to make more LIHEAP funding available to low income families   Several times this year  Senator Clinton has made similar requests to the President that he release additional contingency funding in anticipation of rising energy costs this winter    The text of the letter to the President follows    The President  The White House  Washington  D C   20500   Dear Mr  President    The Consolidated Appropriations bill for FY2008 included  2 57 billion in funding for the Low Income Housing and Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   including  586 million in contingency funds to be released at your discretion   We are writing to urge you to release the LIHEAP funds immediately   The high energy prices facing consumers and the severe weather of the past few weeks warrant this release      This winter  the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimates that households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2006 2007 winter  and many of these families are carrying energy debt from previous years   As such  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden on families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens to ensure their health and safety through the cold winter months    Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population   During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305   Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise   Home heating prices are projected by the EIA to reach almost  1 000 this year for the typical family  an increase of almost 80 percent higher than the average cost of home heating during the winter of 2001 02   As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power    According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding   The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million    LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children   In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills   For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances      We request that your Administration release the  586 million in FY2008 LIHEAP contingency funds that were recently approved by Congress to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses during a winter that has already seen a significant share of severe winter weather and cold conditions and promises only to get colder
