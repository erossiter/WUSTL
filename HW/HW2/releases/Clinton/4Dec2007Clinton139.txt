                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Clinton Urges Action to Assist Low Income Households in Coming Winter Months as Energy Prices Reach Record Highs   To Ensure Critical Emergency Funding for LIHEAP is Provided  Senator Clinton Also Co Sponsors the Keep Americans Warm Act of 2007                                                                                                                                                     Washington  DC   Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that she has joined a bipartisan coalition of Senators in calling on the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Related Appropriations Subcommittee to include an additional  1 billion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member  the lawmakers urged the subcommittee to provide assistance to households this winter that are facing hardships due to rapidly escalating energy costs by increasing emergency funding for the LIHEAP program by  1 billion for a total of  3 412 billion for FY 2008  In addition  Senator Clinton today cosponsored the Keep Americans Warm Act of 2007  a bill that would provide for the critical  1 billion in emergency funding    With oil prices hovering near record levels and energy prices reaching all time highs  the emergency funding for LIHEAP would provide critical relief for New Yorkers and other Americans who cannot afford to keep their families warm this winter  Senator Clinton said  Low income households disproportionately endure the burden of rising energy costs  and we must act now to supply them with the appropriate assistance so that no one has to suffer through the frigid winter temperatures without heat    Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population   During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305  significantly decreasing the programs purchasing power   Unfortunately  with oil prices nearing  100 per barrel  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  In other words  while the cost of heating ones home continues to rise  federal heating assistance will be significantly lower  This is why it is essential that the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Related Appropriations Subcommittee include an additional  1 billion in emergency funding for LIHEAP     Senator Clinton has worked tirelessly to increase LIHEAP funding to make sure low income New Yorkers are able to heat their homes in the midst of record energy costs  As early as this November  Senator Clinton called on President Bush to make available the remaining  20 million in the LIHEAP contingency fund  See  http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 287872   and joined several of her senate colleagues in calling on the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  to support a funding level of  5 1 billion for LIHEAP for the FY 2009  See   http   clinton senate gov news statements details cfm id 287040     A copy of the letter to Senators Harkin and Specter is attached     December 3  2007   The Honorable Tom Harkin  Chairman      The Honorable Arlen Specter  Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services    and Education  and Related Agencies  Committee on Appropriations  Washington  DC  20510   Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter    We are writing to request that you include an additional  1 billion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in fiscal year 2008 to provide for a total of  3 412 billion   We recognize the difficult budget constraints that the Subcommittee faces and appreciate your support for additional funding for the LIHEAP program in FY2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  and Related Appropriations Conference Report that was vetoed      With the price of oil hovering near  100 per barrel  and the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimating that households can expect to pay between 10 to 26 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2007 2008 winter  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden of families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter     Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population   During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305   Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise   As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power   According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding   The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million   For these reasons  we believe an additional  1 billion in emergency funding is warranted    LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children   In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills   For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances      Moreover  the program helps low income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy burden   Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year     Thank you for your consideration   We look forward to working with you to increase funding for the LIHEAP program to ensure that low income seniors  individuals with disabilities  and families have the resources that they need to stay warm this winter      Sincerely
