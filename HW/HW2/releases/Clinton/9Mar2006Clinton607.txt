March 9  2006 Senators Clinton  Sununu  Join Child Safety Advocates and Parents Who Have Lost Children to Underscore Need to Protect Children in and Around Vehicles                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Washington  DC    Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  NY  and John Sununu  NH  today joined child safety advocates and parents who have lost children in tragic accidents to call for passage of their bipartisan legislation to improve the child safety features in new vehicles   Senators Clinton and Sununu have introduced the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act in the Senate and Representatives Peter King  NY  and Jan Schakowsky  IL  have introduced companion legislation in the House                These tragedies are heart wrenching  not only due to the unimaginable suffering these families endure  but also because they are preventable  The technology exists that can save children  s lives at relatively low cost and new innovations are being developed all the time  With modest  cost effective steps  we can prevent scores of terrible automobile accidents from occurring across our nation  That  s why I have introduced legislation to make sure child safety technology is implemented in new vehicles  With my bill  we can have safer cars and safer kids across America     said Senator Clinton             Last year  over 200 children died as a result of non traffic automobile accidents  With at least 1 000 killed since 1999  including Ian Campbell of Farmington  New Hampshire  preventing these tragic incidents is an important public safety matter     said Sununu    With some modest  cost effective measures    such as backover warning systems  power window strangulation prevention mechanisms  and brakeshift interlocks    we can take important steps to protect our children             Almost every other day  a young child is killed in a non traffic automobile accident  Since 1999  at least 1000 children have died in non traffic  non crash incidents and this number has been steadily rising  The technology exists to protect families and children from these tragedies  but currently neither Congress nor the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requires the technology be installed  Such technology is only available on a select few vehicles  or as an after market product consumers have to purchase themselves           The Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act addresses issues surrounding vehicles and child safety  such as children being backed over  strangled by power windows or killed when they or someone else inadvertently knocks a vehicle into motion  The bill directs the U S  Secretary of Transportation to issue three regulations to decrease the incidence of child injury and death  The first regulation will ensure that power windows automatically reverse direction when they detect an obstruction to prevent children from being trapped  injured or killed  A second will provide drivers with a means of detecting the presence of a person or object behind their vehicle  And a third will provide for the vehicle service brake to be engaged to prevent vehicles from unintentionally rolling away  The bill also establishes a child safety information program administered by the Secretary of Transportation to collect non traffic  non crash incident data and disseminate information to parents about these hazards and ways to mitigate them             More and more children are losing their lives needlessly in and around cars every week     said Janette Fennell  President of KIDS AND CARS     We must pass this important child safety legislation immediately to prevent future tragedies  our children simply cannot wait              The technology exists that can save children  s lives at relatively low cost and new innovations are being developed all the time  Power window sensors  for example  cost only  8 12 a window  Brakeshift interlocks are already standard in most passenger vehicles  but where they aren  t  they cost only  5 a car  Backover warning systems cost a bit more in today  s market  approximately  300 a car  but if these or similar technologies were required  the market would create even more competition and drive down the price
