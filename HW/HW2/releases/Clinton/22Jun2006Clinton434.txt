June 22  2006 Clinton Continues Fight to Save Long Island Junior ROTC Programs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Clinton amendment agreed to by Senate would force Department of Defense to review elimination of programs in Mattituck and Greenport    Bill expected to be approved by Senate                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington  DC    Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced that the Senate has approved  by unanimous consent  the inclusion of language into the Fiscal Year 2007 Department of Defense Authorization Bill that would require the Department of Defense to review its decision that lead to the elimination of Naval Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps  NJROTC  programs in Mattituck and Greenport  The full bill is expected to be approved by the Senate next week  Senator Clinton  s amendment mirrors language that Congressman Bishop successfully included in the House Department of Defense Authorization Bill            There is simply no logic to the Navy  s decision to eliminate the JROTC programs at Greenport and Mattituck  The young men and women who are participating in this program have chosen to give something back to their community and learn something about leadership and now the Navy wants to force them to pay more money and spend more time doing that     Senator Clinton said    We simply cannot pull the rug out from under them like this  I am pleased that my colleagues agreed with me and supported this amendment             Specifically  the amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to review the 1976 legal opinion issued by the Department of Defense General Counsel that determined that Junior Reserve Officers  Training Corps  JROTC  instructors may be transported to a non host school only to teach students previously enrolled in the JROTC unit at the host school  and only when it is impractical to require them to take courses at that host school  The purpose of the secretary s review would be to determine whether changes in law since 1976  including the repeal of the statutory limits on the number of JROTC units  and local school redistricting  which have split a host school s JROTC students into nearly equal groups  would now allow for the instructors from a host school to travel to and instruct JROTC students at another nearby school  This section also would allow a host school that is currently providing for the assignment of JROTC instructors to another school with 70 or more students the authority to continue such support until 180 days following the submission of the report by the Secretary of Defense
