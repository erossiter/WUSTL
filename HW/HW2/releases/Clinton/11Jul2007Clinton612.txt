July 11  2007 Statement of former President Bill Clinton and Senator Hillary Clinton on the death of Lady Bird Johnson                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Lady Bird Johnson was a beloved First Lady and an American treasure  Every American owes her a debt of gratitude because it was her devotion to the environment that brought us the Beautification Act of 1965 and the scenic roadside development and environmental clean up efforts that followed and because she supported President Johnson s fights for civil rights and against poverty  Lady Bird was a strong woman who inspired her daughters and other young women to develop and speak their minds  We were honored to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the White House with her  and will never forget her kindness and friendship to us   Our thoughts and prayers are with Lynda  Luci and the entire Johnson family
