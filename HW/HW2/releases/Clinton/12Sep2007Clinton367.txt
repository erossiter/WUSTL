September 12  2007 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Regarding FEMA Decision to Deny Approval to Indian Point Siren System Pending Improvements by Entergy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Entergys failure to get the siren system up to FEMA standards is completely inexcusable  They have had more than two years to get this right and we are still waiting   Entergy must give their full attention to resolving these important operational and safety concerns  We simply cannot wait any longer  I urge the NRC to take appropriate enforcement action  and I will ask the Department of Homeland Securitys  DHS  Inspector General to conduct an investigation into this matter   The communities around Indian Point deserve better  and I call on Entergy to move as swiftly as possible to correct the problems identified by FEMA    Senator Clinton recently announced that she would be asking the DHS inspector general to evaluate why Entergy has failed meet established deadlines to achieve operability of a new alert and notification system for the Indian Point nuclear power plant     Senator Clinton has worked to push both the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  NRC  and Entergy to improve safety  security and emergency preparedness at the plant  including the siren system  Senator Clinton added a provision to the energy bill in 2005 to require Entergy to install a new siren system with battery backup in response to repeated failures of the Indian Point siren system due to a lack of backup power   That provision was signed into law in August of 2005  and the NRC set a January 2007 deadline for having the system operational   Entergy applied for and received an extension of the deadline to April 15th  and subsequently missed the deadline   NRC fined Entergy  130 000 and Senator Clinton announced that she would sponsor Senate companion legislation to a bill to be sponsored in the U S  House by Congresswoman Nita Lowey  D Westchester Rockland  and Congressman John Hall  D Hudson Valley   that would steer fines levied by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for safety violations to counties surrounding nuclear facilities in order to assist them with emergency planning        Senator Clinton has also continued to call for the NRC to conduct an Independent Safety Assessment  ISA  at Indian Point and has introduced legislation to require an ISA at the plant      Read more statements by Senator Clinton concerning the Indian Point nuclear power plant
