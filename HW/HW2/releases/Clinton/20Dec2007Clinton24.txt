health care will all benefit from these funds  said Senator Clinton  I especially welcome funding for interoperable communications in Onondaga County  These improvements are critical for the safety

resources  This is a two phase construction project with Phase I having been approved and supported with  3 million in FY 2006 military construction funding  The NEADS is located on the former Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome  Unit personnel are housed in three different locations  Relocating the Headquarters building inside the Sector Operations Control Center  SOCC  Compound and moving personnel from Depot 1 to this building will improve protection of NEADS personnel and facilities    The Auburn Regional Bioenergy Enterprise will use federal funds to develop a new power source for the city of Auburns Waste Water Treatment Plant  The Engineering Feasibility study recommended that the city transition from sludge incineration which is Natural Gas dependent to a methane digester utilizing the technology of Europe to dispose of the wastewater treatment plant sludge  utilize existing landfill methane gas and converting this into electricity to operate the citys wastewater treatment plant saving approximately  1 5 M operating costs per year and provide economic development power to industrial users at Technology Park    The omnibus bill includes federal funds for the Revitalization and Redevelopment project of the Hamlet of Brewerton in the Town of Cicero   These funds will be the impetus for taking the long neglected area of the Brewerton waterfront and changing it to a thriving and bustling area   By doing so  significant new jobs would be created  property values would be greatly increased  and people in the northern suburbs of Onondaga County and southern suburbs of Oswego County would be able to enjoy a vibrant waterfront community    Federal funds were also approved for the United Auto Workers Region 9 Training Initiative   This initiative will fund
