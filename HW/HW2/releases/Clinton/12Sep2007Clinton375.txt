                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Clinton Urges Action to Assist Low Income Households Before Funds Expire                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC  Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton announced today that she has joined a bipartisan coalition of Senators in calling on President Bush to make available the remaining  151 5 million in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  contingency fund for low income households   In a letter to the president sent yesterday  the bipartisan group urged him to render assistance to households that are facing hardship due to increasing energy costs  and to release these funds before  131 million expires on September 30    No American should have to choose between paying for food or prescriptions and paying their energy bills but with energy prices increasing  that is exactly the kind of false and dangerous choice that many people are facing  said Senator Clinton   LIHEAP can help families who face this unthinkable situation  and the time to act is now   Low income households disproportionately endure the burden of rising energy costs  and the president must act to release the  131 million that could ease that burden before it expires at the end of this month  I urge the president to release all remaining LIHEAP contingency funds so that we can help those who are in need    A National Energy Directors Association  NEADA  survey this year found that millions of American households experience difficulty paying arrearages from last winters heating bills  coping with shutoff of service  and meeting rising air conditioning costs   LIHEAP offers federal funds to these households  which may face rate increases of up to 50 percent this year   Of the  151 5 million that remains in the LIHEAP contingency fund   131 million is scheduled to expire September 30     A copy of the letter sent to President Bush follows    The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President    The  50 million released last week from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  contingency fund is a good first step to address hotter than normal conditions experienced in several parts of the country this summer   However  a significant need still exists across the nation for additional home energy assistance to help families and seniors meet rising arrears and shut off notices   We strongly urge you to immediately release the remaining  151 5 million in the LIHEAP contingency fund and provide funding to all states to address this emergency   If the Administration fails to release the remaining funding   131 million of that balance will expire on September 30      Earlier this summer the National Energy Directors Association  NEADA  conducted a national survey of utility arrearages and shutoffs   The survey found that millions of low income households this year are facing a severe hardship paying arrearages from last winters heating bills  coping with impending and actual shutoff of service  and meeting rising air conditioning costs   The survey estimated that at least 1 2 million households have been disconnected from electric and natural gas service during the three month period following the end of state shutoff moratoriums   This was a conservative estimate as the level of shutoffs was likely to go higher as utilities completed credit and collection procedures   The statute specifically defines a significant increase in home energy disconnections as an emergency and reason for the release of funds    According to the Energy Information Administration  EIA   U S  residential electricity prices are expected to increase at a rate of 3 percent this year   States undergoing market restructuring continue to experience more rapid price increases as rate caps expire and higher fuel costs are passed through to consumers   In some instances  customers may see rate increases of up to 50 percent      Low income Americans experience a much higher energy burden than the average American household   Too many of these households face difficult financial choices in trying to meet basic human necessities on an income that simply wont stretch far enough to cover it all   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between paying an energy bill and putting food on the table for themselves and their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills   For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances      It would be unfortunate to permit  131 million in LIHEAP contingency funds to expire given the need to help families and seniors restore service and reduce energy burdens   Thank you for your consideration    Sincerely
