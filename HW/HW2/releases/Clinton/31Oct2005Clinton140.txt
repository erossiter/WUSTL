October 31  2005 Statement of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton Clinton on the Nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The President  s selection of Third Circuit Court Judge Samuel Alito to replace retiring Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O  Connor must initiate a thoughtful and deliberate process of closely examining and scrutinizing Judge Alito  s record to determine whether he merits a seat on the highest court in the nation   What we currently know about Judge Alito raises serious questions about whether he will be steadfast in protecting our most fundamental rights   I intend to closely examine Judge Alito  s record and qualifications and carefully monitor the Judiciary Committee hearings in order to determine whether he intends to be a guardian of the rule of law who puts fairness and justice before ideology          I hope that both the President and Judge Alito will be forthcoming during this process so that my colleagues and I can fully discharge our constitutional mandate of providing the President with meaningful  advice and consent  on his nomination
